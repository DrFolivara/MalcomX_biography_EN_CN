FOREWORD 
前言
Behold, America. Just when our country's cultural evolution appears to have the man who wasthe author of the internationally acclaimed _Roots_ passed away suddenly in the middle of thenight. Alex Haley and I had discussed the possibility of my writing his autobiography toacknowledge our literary circle, our family of writers-my father to him and him to me. 
看啊，美国。就在我们国家的文化进化似乎已经拥有了国际上广受好评的《根》一书的作者突然在午夜去世的时候。亚历克斯·海利和我讨论过我写他的自传的可能性，以感谢我们的文学界、我们的作家家庭——他的父亲是我，而我是他。
Six years have passed since I received this initial request to prepare a new foreword for myfather's life story. My godfather's wish was that I commemorate my father's life by writing aboutsome of the significant events that have served as a postscript for his extraordinary life story, butto do this it is essential to begin with the legacy that my father himself was heir to from thebeginning. 
自从我收到最初的请求，为我父亲的生平故事撰写一篇新的前言以来已经过去了六年。我的教父希望我能通过写一些对他非凡人生故事具有补充意义的重要事件来纪念我的父亲的生命，但是要做到这一点，必须从我父亲自己从一开始就继承下来的遗产开始。
In 1919, my paternal grandparents, Earl and Louisa Little, married and began their large family ofeight children. At the same time they both worked steadfastly as crusaders for Marcus Garvey'sUniversal Negro Improvement Association, acting as chapter president and writer/translator formore than a decade. Their children were deeply involved and inspired by their parents' mission toencourage self-reliance and uphold a sense of empowerment for people of the African Diaspora. 
1919年，我的外公外婆厄尔和路易莎·利特结婚并开始了他们八个孩子的大家庭。同时，他们两人坚定地为马库斯·加维的“全球黑人改善协会”工作，担任分会会长和十余年的作家/翻译。他们的孩子深受父母使命的启发，积极参与其中，鼓励自我独立，为非洲侨民维护一种赋权感。
Given the turbulence, fear, and despair of the depression era, with its economic droughts andracial and social inequities, my grandparents could never have imagined that one of their ownchildren would have his likeness on a United States postal stamp before the century's end. 
考虑到经济干旱、种族和社会不平等等问题，以及萧条时期的动荡、恐惧和绝望，我的祖父母从未想过他们自己的孩子之一会在本世纪末的美国邮票上印有他的照片。
Eighty years later, on January 20,1999, pride filled Harlem's historic Apollo Theatre as six of Earland Louisa Little's granddaughters sat encircled by a body of fifteen hundred, as family, friends,esteemed guests, and well-wishers gathered to celebrate a momentous occasion-the unveiling ofthe United States Postal Service's newest release in its Black Heritage Stamp Series. 
80年后的1999年1月20日，在哈莱姆历史悠久的阿波罗剧院里，六位厄尔和路易莎·利特的孙女们被一千五百人围坐在中间，亲朋好友、尊贵的客人和祝福者们齐聚一堂，共同庆祝一个重大时刻——美国邮政服务最新发布的黑人文化遗产邮票系列的揭幕仪式。
The issuance of the stamp with the image of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz-known to the world asMalcolm X and fondly loved by myself and my five sisters as Daddy-will provide a source ofeternal pride to his children. While this was indeed a glorious moment, it does not cancel the painof the loss of both our parents, or even kiss away the ache of their absence. What it certainlydoes is add to the blessings of our dowry. 
这张印有马尔科姆·X(Malcolm X)的邮票将为他的子女提供永恒的骄傲。虽然这确实是光荣的时刻，但它并不能抹去我们父母双亡的痛苦，甚至不能消除他们缺席的疼痛。但它确实为我们嫁妆增添了祝福。
The stamp also serves as a reminder of the stock from which we were born and confirmssignificantly that how one lives his or her life today stands as a testament to one's forever after. 
这张邮票也提醒我们，我们来自哪里，并确认了今天如何生活是对一个人永恒的见证。
In his genuine humility and pure dedication to service, my father had no idea of the potency of hisdeeds, of the impact his life would have on others, or of the legacy that was to unfold. As he andmy godfather, Alex Haley, worked diligently to complete this classic work-in person, from airporttelephones, via ship to shore, or over foreign wire services-he could never have imagined byAmerica's tone in his final days that his words, philosophy, and wisdom would be so appreciatedand honored around the world, or that it would still offer inspiration and guidance to so many. 
在我父亲真诚的谦逊和纯粹的服务精神中，他并不知道其行为的力量、其生命对他人的影响或即将展开的遗产。在他和我教父亚历克斯·海利一起努力完成这部经典作品的过程中——通过机场电话、轮船到岸边、或通过外国电讯服务亲自完成——他从未想象到在他生命的最后几年里，他的话语、哲学和智慧会被全世界如此赞赏和尊敬，或者它仍然会给如此多的人带来启示和指导。
In my father's absence, my mother nurtured and protected the significance and value of herhusband's endless devotion to human rights. She was thrilled by the opening discussions abouther husband's image appearing on a U.S. postal stamp. From her perspective, it was not asinconceivable as others have found it. To my mother, it was his due. 
在我父亲不在的时候，我的母亲培养和保护了她丈夫对人权的无尽奉献的意义和价值。她对于关于她丈夫形象出现在美国邮票上的公开讨论感到兴奋。在她看来，这并不像其他人所认为的那样难以置信。对于我的母亲来说，这是应得的。
As the house lights dimmed in the Apollo Theatre, the flickering images of black-and-whitephotographs and film clips on the screen chronicled my father's life. Bittersweet, his youthful faceand broad smile caressed my heart. As the documentary film moved forward, the voice-over ofour dear family friend and loving "uncle" actor Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy from my father'sfuneral in 1965. This became the backdrop for the montage of nostalgicchildhood memories thatplayed in my mind. Life with both parents and my little sisters. Life joyous and uninterrupted. 
随着阿波罗剧院的灯光逐渐变暗，屏幕上闪烁着黑白照片和电影片段，记录着我父亲的一生。他年轻时的脸庞和灿烂的笑容让我感到既心酸又甜蜜。随着纪录片的推进，我们亲爱的家庭朋友兼爱称“叔叔”的演员奥西·戴维斯(Ossie Davis)为我们的父亲1965年的葬礼献上了悼词。这成为了我在脑海中回放的怀旧童年记忆的背景。与父母和我的五个妹妹一起的生活，充满欢乐且毫无中断。
When people ask how my mother managed to keep my father's memory alive, all I can say is-formy mother, he never left. He never left her. He never left us. My father's spiritual presence is whatsustained my mother. And we, their children, were the beneficiaries of their timeless love for oneanother. 
当人们问我的母亲如何保持我父亲的记忆时，我只能说——对于我的母亲来说，他从未离开。他从未离开她。他从未离开我们。我父亲的精神存在是我母亲的支撑力量。而我们，他们的子女，是他们永恒相爱的受益者。
Born and raised in a family that was culturally varied, I innately gravitated to the rhythms of theworld. Mommie was our constant, as many mothers are. Daddy was the jubilant energy in ourworld. He was not at all like the descriptions I grew up hearing. In addition to being determined,focused, honest, he was also greatly humorous, delightful, and boy-like, while at the same time astrong, firm male presence in a house filled with little women. His women. My sisters, me, and ourmother. A collaboration of qualities that enchants me even now. 
在文化多样的家庭中出生和成长，我天生就喜欢世界的节奏。妈妈是我们的常数，就像许多母亲一样。爸爸是我们世界中的欢乐能量。他一点也不像我在成长过程中听到的描述。除了坚定、专注、诚实之外，他还非常幽默、讨人喜欢、像个男孩，同时又是一个强有力的男性存在，家里住着很多小女人。他的女性。我的姐妹们、我和我的母亲。这些品质的结合让我至今仍然着迷。
". . . If you knew him you would know why we must honor him," Uncle Ossie's voice continued."Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood. . . . and, in honoring him, we honor thebest in ourselves. . . ." 
“如果你了解他，你就会知道为什么我们必须尊敬他。”奥西叔叔的声音继续说道，“马尔科姆是我们的男子气概、我们的生活、黑人男子气概......通过尊敬他，我们也在尊敬自己中最优秀的一面。”
A spotlight on the Apollo podium brought me back to the present as the announcer introducedRuby Dee and Ossie Davis, the first of an intimate selection of my father's esteemed comradesand appreciators from the "front line" to speak and share their remembrances. 
聚光灯照亮了阿波罗的讲台，当主持人介绍鲁比·迪和奥西·戴维斯时，我回到了现在。他们是第一批亲密选择的我父亲尊敬的同志和欣赏者，他们来自“前线”发表演讲并分享他们的回忆。
Aunt Ruby opened, "What a privilege to witness the radical gone respectable in our times. . . ."Uncle Ossie continued, "We in this community look upon this commemorative stamp finally asAmerica's stamp of approval. . . ." 
鲁比阿姨开始说道：“在这个时代，能够见证一个激进分子变得受人尊敬是多么荣幸......”奥西叔叔继续说道：“我们这个社区把这张纪念邮票最终看作是美国的认可......”
When I had mentioned the issuance of the stamp to others, the news simply stopped folks in theirtracks. Touched. Teary-eyed. They could hardly believe it. They had to catch their breath, or askme to repeat myself. "How can this be?" they wondered. "A stamp with Brother Malcolm's face onit?" "What does it mean?" "Is America really ready for a Malcolm X stamp, even if it is thirty-fouryears after his assassination?" 
当我向别人提到这张邮票的发行时，这个消息让人们感到震惊。感动得热泪盈眶。他们几乎无法相信这是真的。他们不得不喘口气，或者让我重复一遍。“怎么可能？”他们想知道，“上面有马尔科姆兄弟的照片？”“这意味着什么？”“美国真的准备好了一张马尔科姆X邮票吗？即使是在他被暗杀34年后？”
I reflected on the message of Congressman Chaka Fattah, the ranking Democrat on the Postalsubcommittee, who commented, "There is no more appropriate honor than this stamp becauseMalcolm X sent all of us a message through his life and his life's work. 
我想到了众议院邮政委员会中的民主党资深议员查卡·法塔赫的评论：“这张邮票是最合适的荣誉，因为马尔科姆·X通过他的一生和工作向我们所有人传递了信息。”
"Stamps are affixed to envelopes that contain messages, and when we receive an envelope withthis particular stamp on it hopefully it is a message that will speak again to the conscience of thisnation. Hopefully not just to those of African descent in America but to those who want to speakand be heard on the question of human rights throughout the world. To this day Malcolm X standsas a leader. His thoughts, his ideas, his conviction, and his courage provide an inspiration evennow to new generations that come." 
“邮票贴在信封上，里面包含着信息。当我们收到一个带有这个特殊邮票的信封时，希望里面的信息会再次唤醒这个国家的良知。不仅希望这能影响到在美国的非裔美国人，也希望影响到那些想要就世界各地的人权问题发声并被听到的人。马尔科姆·X至今仍是一位领袖。他的思想、理念、信念和勇气仍然激励着新一代人。”
I've asked myself, What change in our society today permits the reevaluation of my father'sconvictions or his stance on the human injustices that plagued the international landscape? Foryears, he's been the subject of a patchwork of commentaries, numerous judgments, and endlesscharacter assessments from a spectrum of self-appointed experts. But, in spite of thepsychoanalysis, Malcolm will always be exactly who he is, whether or not we as a society eversucceed in figuring him out. Truth does not change, only our awareness of it. 
我一直在问自己，当今社会中哪些变化允许重新评估我父亲的信仰或他对困扰国际地缘政治的人道不公的立场？多年来，他一直是各种评论、无数判决和无休止的性格评估的主角，来自各种自封的专家。但是，尽管有精神分析，马尔科姆永远都是他真实的自己，无论我们这个社会是否能够理解他。真相不会改变，只有我们对它的认识。
Not everyone agreed with my father's philosophy or methodology; he was consideredcomplicated, intricate, and complex. Nevertheless, he was always a focused man with acommitment and a program. His plan of action, regardless of the stages of his life, his agenda,and his perspective were always poignantly clear. 
并不是所有人都同意我父亲的哲学或方法论；他被认为是复杂、细致和深奥的。然而，他始终是一个专注的人，有着承诺和计划。他的行动计划，无论在他的生命阶段、议程和他的观点中，都总是清晰而感人的。
Malcolm X never advocated violence. He was an advocate of cultural and social reconstruction- until a balance of equality was shared, "by any means necessary." Generally, this phrase of hiswas misused, even by those who were his supporters. But the statement was intended toencourage a paralyzed constituent of American culture to consider the range of options to whichthey were entitled-the "means." "By any means necessary" meant examine the obstacles,determine the vision, find the resolve, and explore the alternatives toward dissolving theobstacles. Anyone truly familiar with my father's ideology, autobiography, and speeches sincerelyunderstands the significance of the now-famous phrase. 
马尔科姆·X从未提倡暴力。他主张文化和社会重建，直到平等得以分享，“以任何必要手段”。通常，他的这个短语被误用，甚至是他的支持者。但这个声明是为了鼓励美国文化中处于瘫痪状态的选民考虑他们有权选择的范围-“手段”。“以任何必要手段”意味着检查障碍、确定愿景、找到决心、探索消除障碍的替代方案。真正了解我父亲的思想、自传和演讲的人都会真诚地理解现在广为人知的这个短语的重要性。
My father affected Americans-black and white-in untold measure and not always in ways asdefinitive as census charts and polls have dictated. We've misrepresented the silent majority onboth sides. There were black folks who carried as much disdain for my father as some white folksdid, and then there were some white folks for whom his life's lessons were as valuable a blueprintfor personal and spiritual development as they have been for many black folks. Nevertheless,within the range of the boisterous and the silent there are still folks brown, red, and yellow on thiscontinent and elsewhere who honor and respect the true message of Malcolm X Shabazz. 
我父亲对美国黑人和白人产生了难以估量的影响，这并不总是像人口普查图表和民意调查所规定的那样明确。我们对双方的沉默大多数进行了错误的描述。有些黑人对我父亲有着和他一样多的厌恶感，而有些白人则将他的生命经验视为个人和精神发展的宝贵蓝图，对他们来说意义重大。然而，在这个喧嚣和沉默的范围内，仍然有棕色、红色和黄色的人们在这个大陆和其他地方尊重和尊重马尔科姆·X·沙巴兹的真实信息。
Fortunately, as a child, my surroundings were filled with my father's partners for social change.This warm, devoted circle of people was always on the front lines of the struggle, working toensure the rightful equilibrium of human rights-not just domestically, but globally-"by any meansnecessary." Whether they were persons of note or simply hardworking citizens, these individualsin my early life were missionaries of justice, each committed to doing his or her part. As thededication ceremony continued at the Apollo, the master of ceremonies, activist-entertainer HarryBelafonte-yet another childhood "uncle"-framed the importance of this historic moment for theaudience assembled. 
幸运的是，作为一个孩子，我的周围充满了我父亲的社会变革伙伴。这个温暖、忠诚的人群总是在斗争的最前线，努力确保人权的正当平衡-不仅是在国内，而且在全球范围内-“任何必要的手段”。无论他们是知名人士还是只是勤奋的公民，这些人在我早期的生命中是正义的传教士，每个人都致力于尽自己的一份力量。在阿波罗举行的纪念仪式上，主持人、活动家兼艺人哈里·贝拉方特(Harry Belafonte)-另一个童年“叔叔”-向聚集在一起的观众强调了这一历史时刻的重要性。
"Each year the Postal Service receives more than forty thousand requests recommendingsubjects for U.S. stamps. Only thirty or so are chosen. Short of a national monument inWashington-and that's not a bad idea-a stamp is among the highest honors that our country canpay to any of its citizens." 
“每年，邮政服务都会收到超过40,000份关于推荐美国邮票主题的请求。只有约30个被选中。如果没有华盛顿的国家纪念碑-这并不是一个坏主意-那么邮票就是我们国家能够给予其公民的最高荣誉之一。”
The El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz/Malcolm X stamp is the twenty-second in the Black Heritage Series,which was inaugurated in 1978. It joins s uch luminaries as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass,A. Philip Randolph, Mary McLeod Bethune, Martin Luther King, Jr., and others. I am hopeful thatthe initial printing of  100 million stamps will be some inspiration to those who collect them or passthem on as gifts to represent or encourage one's personal enlightenment and triumph. 
“马尔科姆·X邮票是黑人遗产系列的第22枚邮票，该系列于1978年启动。它与诸如哈里特·塔布曼、弗雷德里克·道格拉斯、A·菲利普·伦道夫、玛丽·麦克莱奥德·贝瑟恩、小马丁·路德·金和其他一些杰出人物一起加入其中。我希望最初发行的1亿枚邮票将给那些收集或将其作为礼物赠送给他人的人带来一些启示，以代表或鼓励个人的启蒙和胜利。”
What my father aspired to be and what Allah had destined for him was nurtured chiefly by thefertile tutelage of his parents while his family was still together and thriving as a unit. This wasbefore his father's murder by the Klan, his mother's emotional breakdown, and the subsequentscattering of his siblings and himself into an inadequate and inattentive foster care system. 
我父亲渴望成为什么，以及真主为他注定的是什么，主要是在他还和家人在一起、家庭兴旺的时候，得到了父母的丰富教导。这是在他父亲被三K党谋杀、母亲情绪崩溃、随后他的兄弟姐妹和他自己被迫分散到一个不充分且不关心的寄养系统中之前。
My grandmother had a direct hand in the cultural, social, and intellectual education of herchildren. The attitude of people of color during the '20s and '30s festered with racial tension thatproduced varying degrees of misguided social and personal paralysis. Knowing this and beingglobally educated members of the Garvey movement cognizant of the true origins of the African inthe Western Hemisphere, both my grandmother and her husband were intent on equipping theirchildren with a clear awareness of the seed of their origins and it's ancestral power. They knewthat this would provide a base of strength for their children. My grandmother knew that in spite ofAmerica's social climate, her children would be able to discern for themselves when an act wasgenerated by pure racism, or simply by ignorance. 
我的祖母直接参与了她孩子的文化、社会和智力教育。20世纪20年代和30年代的种族紧张气氛导致了不同程度的错误的社会和个人瘫痪。了解这一点，并作为全球教育的Garvey运动成员，他们清楚非洲人在西半球的真正起源，我的祖母和她丈夫都决心让他们的孩子有一个清晰的认识他们的起源和祖先的力量。他们知道这将为他们的孩子提供一个基础力量。我的祖母知道尽管美国的社交气候，她的孩子能够自己分辨出纯粹的种族主义行为，还是简单的无知所导致的。
For example, there are many who know the story about when my father, while on the honor rolland the eighth-grade class president, was told by his white teacher that his dream to be a lawyerwas unrealistic for a "colored boy." Maybe he should consider carpentry. . . . He shared this storywith us directly. The teacher actually admired my father greatly and didn't want to encourage himto enter a field of study that he believed wouldn't allow my father to excel. Misguided, yet wellintended. A teacher crippled by a country that offered little promise or future for its indigenous andcolored inhabitants. 
例如，许多人都知道我父亲的故事。当时他还是八年级班长，成绩优秀，但他的白人老师告诉他，对于一个“有色人种的孩子”来说，成为律师的梦想是不现实的，也许他应该考虑学木工......他直接跟我们分享了这个故事。那位老师实际上非常欣赏我的父亲，但并不想鼓励他进入一个他认为不会让他充分发挥的领域。虽然有些误导，但出发点是好的。这位老师被这个国家所束缚，无法给予土著和有色人种居民足够的希望和未来。
Without the strong support of life with his parents and siblings under one roof and chafing underfoster parents and teachers imposing limited state policies, Malcolm simply dropped out. 
在与父母和兄弟姐妹同住、受到寄养父母和老师施加的有限国家政策的限制下，马尔科姆没有得到强有力的生活支持。因此他选择退学。
This is usually where the recounting of my father's life begins. In the street. Hustling, numbersrunning, stealing . . . Indeed these accounts were factual and he was always the first to tell them.But if his first fourteen years hadn't been rooted in a healthy diet of education and the richness ofhis heritage, Malcolm wouldn't have found himself gravitating to the prison libraries after he wasincarcerated. The movie _Malcolm X_, which was originally contracted as _X: The Movie_, showshim learning how to read the dictionary as if he didn't already know how. The truth is, it had beena while since he'd read anything. But after being reacquainted with books, he proceeded to out- read the library stock. I've seen letters that my father wrote from prison in his early twenties,eagerly looking for the third volume of a text, or wanting help to track down out-of-print books, oreven suggesting books to his friends and family on the outside. The honor roll studentreappeared as the layers of street life faded. He read so much that he had to begin to wearglasses. 
这通常就是我父亲生活经历的开始。在街上，他忙碌着，数着钱，偷东西......的确，这些故事是真实的，他总是第一个讲给他们听。但是，如果他在前十四年没有接受过健康教育和丰富的文化传承，马尔科姆就不会在被监禁后被吸引到监狱图书馆。电影《马尔科姆X》原名为《X: The Movie》，展现了他像一个不会读字典的人一样学习如何阅读。事实上，他已经有一段时间没读书了。但是，在重新接触书籍之后，他开始超越图书馆的库存。我曾经看到过我的父亲在二十多岁时从监狱写来的信件，他急切地寻找第三卷文本，或者寻求帮助找到已停印的书籍，甚至向外面的朋友和家人推荐书籍。那个荣誉榜学生再次出现时，街道生活的层层迷雾消失了。他读得太多了，以至于不得不开始戴眼镜。
With the encouragement of his brothers, he began studying the tenets of the Nation of Islam.While the little brothers didn't adhere to all of the teachings personally, they did believe it was theonly current American-based ideology that had the potential to unify black people and teach self- pride the way their childhood affiliation with the Garvey movement had done. Also, the brothersbelieved that through the Nation of Islam they could finally become part of a larger family thatcould reunite them once again. 
在他的兄弟们的鼓励下，他开始研究伊斯兰国家的教义。虽然小兄弟们没有完全遵循所有教义，但他们相信这是唯一一个有潜力团结黑人并教授自尊心的思想，就像他们在童年时期与Garvey运动的联系一样。此外，兄弟们相信通过伊斯兰国家，他们最终可以成为更大的家庭的一部分，将他们再次团聚在一起。
It was as a result of the documentary he was producing on the Nation of Islam that Mike Wallace,an uncompromising, truth-seeking pioneer of broadcast journalism and now the seniorcorrespondent of _60 Minutes_, f irst met my father on an assignment. He recalled those earlymeetings in his remarks at the stamp's unveiling: 
正是由于他所制作的关于伊斯兰国家的纪录片，使得麦克·华莱士首次与我的父亲见面。他是坚定的、寻求真相的广播新闻先驱，现在是《60分钟》的资深记者。他在他的发言中回忆了那些早期的会议：
"It was forty years ago, back in 1959, that I first heard about a man who called himself Malcolm X.We at Channel  13 had set out to produce a documentary that we had intended to call 'The HateThat Hate Produced.' It was a report about a group and a man just beginning to get someattention in the white world. The group was the Black Muslims and their leader was ElijahMuhammad. [When] we finally broadcast the documentary, America at large finally learned aboutthe Nation and their desire to separate from the white man. Their hatred of the white man for thateffectively was their credo back then: The white man hates us, so we should hate the white manback. Not long after the broadcast, which caused a considerable stir, Louis Lomax invited me tosit down for breakfast for my first meeting with Malcolm, and strangely and rather swiftly after thatmorning a curious friendship began to develop, and slowly a trust. And on my part a growingunderstanding and eventually an admiration for a man with a daring mind and heart. Andgradually it became apparent to me that here was a genuine, compassionate, and far-seeingleader in the making. A man utterly devoted to his people, but at the same time he was bent onreconciliation between the races in America. 
“那是在1959年，也就是40年前，我第一次听说了一个自称马尔科姆·X的人。我们13频道的工作人员开始制作一部纪录片，原本打算叫《仇恨所生出的仇恨》。这是一部关于一个团体和一个人在白人世界中开始引起关注的报道。这个团体是黑人穆斯林会，他们的领袖是伊利亚·穆罕默德。[当我们最终播出这部纪录片时，美国大众终于知道了这个国家及其与白人的分离愿望。他们对白人的仇恨在当时实际上就是他们的信条：白人恨我们，所以我们应该回敬白人。播出后不久，引起了不小的轰动，路易斯·洛马克斯邀请我坐下来吃早餐，这是我第一次见到马尔科姆。奇怪的是，在那之后不久，一种奇特而迅速的友谊开始发展，慢慢地建立了信任。而我则逐渐理解并最终欣赏到他那勇敢、有远见的思想和心灵。渐渐地，我意识到他是一个真正、富有同情心、眼光长远的领导者。他全心全意为人民服务，但同时又致力于在美国种族之间实现和解。”
"And that, of course, that was heresy to the Nation of Islam at the time. 
“当然，这在当时是伊斯兰国家的异端邪说。”
"Malcolm was still evolving, still finding his way, still finding his constituency back then when hewas struck down-to him not unexpectedly-struck down by forces who feared that his way, hisleadership, might be a serious threat to their power. I have treasured the memory of the Malcolmthat I knew. I know he trusted me as a reporter, but in the few years that I had the chance to knowhim, he sent me on my own voyage of reportorial discovery and understanding. 
“马尔科姆当时仍在成长，仍在寻找自己的道路，仍在寻找他的支持者。他被那些担心他的领导方式可能对他们的权力构成严重威胁的人所击败，这并不出乎意料。我对我知道的马尔科姆有着珍贵的记忆。我知道他把我当作一名记者信任，但在我有幸了解他的几年里，他让我自己去探索和理解新闻报道的道路。”
"[The] stamp that honors him today is the kind of recognition he deserves as a courageousAmerican hero." 
今天为他颁发的邮票是对他作为勇敢的美国英雄所应得的认可。
In time my father's growth and independence would be his undoing. The Nation reprimanded him,stripped him of all powers of attorney, silenced him, and then exiled him. At first his expulsion lefthim feeling like a man without a home, much the way it had been in his childhood. Ultimately,however, it gave him the freedom he needed. 
随着时间的推移，我的父亲的成长和独立最终会成为他的绊脚石。伊斯兰国家谴责他，剥夺了他的所有委托权，让他保持沉默，并将他流放到了国外。起初，他的流放让他感觉像一个没有家的人，这与他童年时期的经历很相似。然而，最终这给了他所需要的自由。
He finally began accepting long-standing invitations he'd received to travel abroad. There weremany foreign heads of state and prime ministers who had long taken note of this charismaticchampion of the people. 
他终于开始接受长期以来收到的出国旅行邀请。
With my mother's blessings for his journey, my father set out to visit Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana,Nasser of Egypt, Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and more. The warm welcomes and instantpaternal relationships became an essential component of his cleansing and rebirth as he traveledthroughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, culminating in his great pilgrimage to Mecca. 
在母亲的祝福下，我父亲开始了对加纳的夸梅·恩克鲁玛、埃及的纳赛尔、沙特阿拉伯的费萨尔王子等外国领导人的访问。他受到了热烈的欢迎和即时的父爱关系，这成为他在欧洲、非洲和中东旅行中洗净并重生的重要组成部分，最终使他得以前往麦加进行伟大的朝圣之旅。
As my father's philosophy expanded, he began to empower, enlighten, and embrace an untoldpopulace extending far beyond the limits of governmental control. However, as long as Dr. MartinLuther King, Jr., remained in the South, and my father in the North, neither was too difficult tomonitor. But when my father and Dr. King became colleagues and decided to bridge their twophilosophies and unite the American commonwealth toward a greater goal, they both becametremendous threats to the status quo. Sadly, this fear was shared by some of their ownconstituents and supporters who believed that the union of both would weaken or detract from thestrength of each movement. 
随着我父亲的哲学观念不断扩展，他开始赋予、启迪和拥抱一个远远超出政府控制范围的无数人民。然而，只要小马丁·路德·金博士留在南方，和我的父亲在北方，就不难监控他们。但是当父亲和金博士成为同事并决定将他们的两种哲学观念结合起来，团结美国各州朝着一个更大的目标前进时，他们都成为了对现状的巨大威胁。遗憾的是，这种恐惧也被他们的一些选民和支持者所分享，他们认为两者的联合会削弱或分散每个运动的力量。
One man whose brethrenship never wavered was the Honorable Percy Sutton, my father'sattorney and a perpetual drum for our family, who approached the podium at the Apollo. Hepaused reflectively and warmly paid tribute to my father, while placing my father's life in its properperspective: 
一位兄弟情谊从未动摇的人是我父亲的律师和家庭的长期鼓手珀西·萨顿(Percy Sutton),他在阿波罗演讲时走到讲台前。他停下来深思熟虑地向我的父亲表示温暖的敬意，同时把我父亲的生命放在适当的视角中：
"It is a miracle, really, if you think about it!" The audience burst into applause. ". . . The journey ofMalcolm X was long and hard. . . . I can remember a Minister Malcolm that nobody wanted to benear; lawyers, accountants, persons of consequence to the black community . . . were afraid tobe identified with him, afraid to be seen with him 
“这真的是一个奇迹，如果你仔细想一想！”观众爆发出掌声。“马尔科姆·X的旅程是漫长而艰难的......我可以记得一个没有人想接近的马尔科姆牧师；律师、会计师、黑人社区中的重要人物都害怕与他的联系，害怕与他在一起。”
"We would invite them to come because we needed lawyers, we needed doctors, we neededpersons of ability, but they were frightened, they were frightened by other people's attitudestoward Minister Malcolm. . . . 
“我们会邀请他们来，因为我们需要律师、医生和有能力的人，但他们害怕，害怕其他人对马尔科姆牧师的态度......”
"Let me for a moment tell you who Malcolm X was. Malcolm was not a spiteful man. Malcolm Xwas a revolutionary. But he was not a mean-spirited revolutionary, he was a gentle man. A kindman, a concerned man. "It was so bad, ladies and gentleman, that even at Malcolm's death therewere people who were afraid to come to the funeral. . . . There was not a major black church inthe entire city of New York that was willing to let us bury him from their edifices. It was a smallchurch up on Amsterdam Avenue [the Faith Temple Church of God] that permitted us to come." 
“让我来告诉你马尔科姆·X是谁。马尔科姆不是一个心怀恶意的人。马尔科姆·X是一位革命者。但他并不是一个心胸狭窄的革命者，他是一个温和、善良、关心他人的人。女士们先生们，这太糟糕了，甚至在马尔科姆去世时，还有人害怕前来参加葬礼......在整个纽约市，没有一个大型的黑人教堂愿意让我们从他们的建筑物里埋葬他。只有一家小教堂——阿姆斯特丹大道上的信仰之堂(Faith Temple Church of God)——允许我们前来。”
Looking into Mr. Sutton's face and seeing him diplomatically balance all that he knew of myparents' challenges brought back an old sadness, one that had not healed since the loss of his"little sister," my mother, Betty. Feeling Mr. Sutton's steadfast devotion, I found myself massagingthe ache from my own heart as I reflected on America's treatment of my parents during mychildhood. Despite my youthful joys and sense of safety, the trials my parents faced wereunrelenting. As well, the way my father was regarded during his lifetime robbed him of any peacein knowing that his life and contributions mattered, and that his family would live without jeo pardyor repercussion. 
看着萨顿先生的脸，看到他巧妙地平衡了他所知道的我父母面临的挑战，让我回想起了一种旧的悲伤，这种悲伤自从母亲贝蒂去世以来一直没有愈合。感受到萨顿先生坚定的忠诚，我在反思美国在我童年时期对待我的父母时，不禁在自己的心中揉搓着痛苦。尽管我年轻时的快乐和安全感，但我父母面临的考验是无情的。同样，父亲在他一生中所受到的待遇剥夺了他任何安心的权利，让他知道生命和贡献是有意义的，他的家人可以在没有任何问题或后果的情况下生活。
Now, perhaps sanctioned by a karmic wave of "in due time," America is acknowledging Malcolmyet again. 
如今，或许是受到“因果报应”的波及，美国再次承认了马尔科姆。
The Honorable S. David Fineman, member of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service,commented on the appropriateness of this acknowledgment during his introduction to the stamp'sofficial unveiling, "Today we honor not only a great African American but a great American.Malcolm X was one of the most charismatic and pivotal figures of our time. He was a passionateand persuasive voice for change, and his controversial ideas helped bring race relations to anational stage. 
美国邮政服务委员会成员S·大卫·菲尔曼阁下在邮票正式发布仪式上介绍时，评论了这一认可的适当性：“今天我们不仅要赞扬一位伟大的非裔美国人，更要赞扬一位伟大的美国人。马尔科姆·X是我们这个时代最具魅力和关键性的人物之一。他是一位充满激情且富有说服力的变革者，他的争议性观点帮助将种族关系带到了国家舞台上。”
"[Malcolm] X poured his energy and anger into speaking the truth about the plight of AfricanAmericans. He spoke with a rare passion and eloquence. He became a worldwide hero. A symbolof strength and defiance. He wasn't shy about telling us where society was goingwrong. ["Although] it has been thirty-four years since we lost Malcolm X, his words, his voice, hisvision, his story of transformation lives on. They have become part of us in a journey towholeness. 
马尔科姆·X将他的能量和愤怒倾注在讲述非洲裔美国人困境的真相上。他以一种罕见的热情和雄辩的口吻发声。他成为了世界级的英雄，象征着力量和反抗。他毫不羞怯地告诉我们社会走向了何方。[尽管]我们已经失去了马尔科姆·X 34年，但他的话语、他的声音、他的愿景和他变革的故事仍然存在。它们已经成为我们追求完整之旅的一部分。
"We must never forget the challenge Malcolm X issued to us. 'Let us learn to live together injustice and love.'" 
我们永远不能忘记马尔科姆·X向我们提出的挑战。“让我们学会在不公正和爱中共同生活。”

I had long known of the individual and cultural values that others placed on my father's life. But Iwould learn of another measurement and display of that value in the marketplace. 
我早已知道其他人对我父亲生命中的个人和文化价值的看法。但我会在市场上学到另一种衡量和展示这种价值的方式。
On October 2, 1992, I was on location in southern Africa producing a segment for a documentaryfilm. During a break in the day, I returned to my hotel room for my afternoon siesta. 
1992年10月2日，我正在南非洲拍摄一部纪录片的现场。在一天的休息时间里，我回到我的酒店房间小睡片刻。
This particular afternoon, I turned on my television and searched until I found a CNN broadcast.Global news commentaries now became the backdrop in my room. I then pulled down the topsheet and blanket on my bed so I could rest. No sooner had my head touched the pillow, I beganto fade, exchanging conscious sounds of the television for those of my inner thoughts. But in amatter of moments I was interrupted by the broadcaster stating, "Earlier today the Alex Haleyestate auctioned off his items. . . ." I instantly sat up and listened in disbelief. The newscastcontinued, "Among the items sold was the original manuscript of _The Autobiography of MalcolmX_, with actual handwritten notes by Malcolm X himself." 
那个特别的下午，我打开电视并搜索直到我找到了一个CNN广播。全球新闻评论现在成为了我房间里的背景音乐。然后我拉下床上的床单和毯子，这样我就可以在上面休息了。我的头刚碰到枕头，我就开始渐渐地失去了意识，把电视的声音换成了我内心的想法。但是在一瞬间，我被广播员打断了，“今天早些时候，Alex Haleyestate拍卖了他的物品...” 我立刻坐起来，不相信地听着。新闻报道继续说道：“其中一件售出的是马尔科姆·X的自传《马尔科姆·X的自传》的手稿，上面有马尔科姆·X本人的手写笔记。”
I cannot possibly recapture in words how I felt at that instant. It seemed inconceivable that such apersonal and historic document could be bartered away so carelessly. 
我无法用言语表达在那一刻我的感受。似乎难以置信这样一份个人和历史性的文件可以如此草率地被交易掉。
It was yet another loss to contend with. I was still brokenhearted about my godfather being gone,and greatly disappointed by the decision to diminish the value of his life's contributions by way ofthe auction block, a symbol that he fought so hard to dismantle in the telling of _Roots_. Doublypainful was the fact that this bidding war included a part of me and my family with neither ourpermission nor participation. Had anyone thought to offer my father's wife and children first rightof refusal? 
这又是一次令人难以承受的损失。我仍然为我的教父的离去感到心碎，并对他的决定深感失望，通过拍卖会削弱他生命贡献的价值，这是他在《根》中努力摧毁的象征。更痛苦的是，这场竞价战包括了我和我的家人的一部分，我们既没有同意也没有参与其中。有人考虑过首先给我父亲的妻子和孩子一个先拒绝的权利吗？
I jotted down as much data as possible during the news coverage and then called the legal firmhandling my godfather's estate auction in Tennessee. Although I did reach a representative, littleInformation was given over the telephone so I scheduled a subsequent call following my return tothe States. 
我在新闻报道期间尽可能多地记录了数据，然后打电话给我父亲在田纳西州处理的遗嘱拍卖的法律公司。虽然我确实联系到了一位代表，但电话上几乎没有提供什么信息，所以我安排了一个随后回国后的回电。
During my long hours of travel across the Atlantic, I worried about how this gross display mayhave been tugging at my mother. How was she feeling about it all? As it was, she'd becomeincreasingly busy due to the explosion of interest about her husband, and the preparations for therelease of X: The Movie. 
在我横渡大西洋的漫长旅途中，我担心这种粗俗的表现可能会对我的母亲产生影响。她对这一切感觉如何？由于对她丈夫的兴趣激增以及《X:电影》的上映准备工作，她变得越来越忙碌。
Malcolm X had been reborn during this period. It was approximately six weeks prior to the worldpremiere and my mother and I were about to embark on a press junket that was to exceed ahundred interviews-print, electronic, video-to promote the film and discuss the resurgence ofMalcolm. 
马尔科姆·X在这个时期复活了。大约在电影全球首映前六周，我和我的母亲即将开始一个超过一百个采访的媒体之旅-印刷、电子、视频-来宣传电影并讨论马尔科姆的复兴。
The vibrant, pop-culture marketing of the film gave people permission to claim and learn aboutMalcolm in a forum that was not threatening. For people who didn't know anything about his life,America now provided a healthier, safer atmosphere to do so. It also gave the public the freedomand opportunity to talk about Malcolm out loud, as opposed to in the murmured huddles thatreflected the climate of the previous generation. 
电影的生动流行文化营销让人们有权利在不威胁的论坛上宣称和了解马尔科姆。对于那些对他的生活一无所知的人来说，美国现在提供了一个更健康、更安全的环境来做这件事。它也给了公众自由和机会大声谈论马尔科姆，而不是像前一代人那样在低声嘀咕中反映出当时的氛围。
So much of the public and the media were under the impression that the making of _X: TheMovie_ was a new venture. That its director had to battle alone, tooth and nail, on behalf of 35million black Americans. Things aren't always as they seem. The components in the making ofthis film were very significant and intertwined like the main branches on a family tree. They werenot to be forgotten. 
所以很多公众和媒体都认为《X:电影》的制作是一次新的尝试。他们认为导演必须孤军奋战，为3500万非裔美国人的利益而战。事情并不总是看起来那样。这部电影制作的各个组成部分都非常关键，像家族树的主干一样交织在一起。它们不应该被遗忘。
Shortly after my father's assassination in 1965 and the publication of _The Autobiography ofMalcolm X_, Marvin Worth, a friend of my father's from their teenage years, approached Alex andmy mother about making a film about my father's life. Once both agreed, Marvin brought JamesBaldwin on board to write the script and Arnold Perl to modify the screenplay. During what was totake twenty-five years to realization, Marvin Worth produced the Warner Bros, documentary _El- Hajj Malik El-Shabazz_. This was the first definitive film stock collection of the life of Malcolm Xand it traveled extensively throughout the nation's university circuit as well as to civil rights andAfro-American nationalist events. In the meantime, this fraternity of men worked diligently againstall setbacks and odds to create a film respectfully representative of their brother, now gone-theman who, in their eyes, America had betrayed. 
1965年我父亲遇刺后不久，《马尔科姆·X自传》出版，我的父亲的一位青少年时期的好友Marvin Worth联系Alex和我的妈妈，提出制作一部关于我父亲生的电影。一旦双方都同意了，Marvin Worth请James Baldwin来写剧本， Arnold Perl修改剧本。在25年的实现过程中，Marvin Worth制作了华纳兄弟公司的纪录片《El- Hajj Malik El-Shabazz》。这是第一部关于马尔科姆·X生活的明确电影库存集合，它在全国大学的巡回展上广泛传播，并参加了民权和非裔美国人民族主义活动。与此同时，这个男人的团体努力克服所有障碍和不利条件，创造了一部尊重地代表他们兄弟的电影，现在他已经去世了-这个人在美国眼中被背叛了。
But old attitudes and distorted stubborn impressions of my father outlived Arnold Perl and JamesBaldwin. Marvin Worth was the lone torchbearer, a thorn in Hollywood's side, holding true to theinitial dream for almost twenty-five years, despite the taboo image of my father. Single-handedly,while keeping my mother abreast of all updates, he continued to commission writers again andagain. 
但是，我父亲的旧态度和扭曲的顽固印象比阿诺德·珀尔和詹姆斯·鲍德温活得更久。Marvin Worth是孤独的火炬手，是好莱坞的眼中钉，坚持着最初的梦想近25年，尽管我的父亲有禁忌的形象。独自一人，同时让我的母亲了解所有的更新情况，他一次又一次地继续委托作家。
Marvin's tenacity was astonishing, to the dismay of many. His dedication and faithfulness weredue to his own personal loyalty to my parents and his passion for displaying onscreen theintegrity and power of my father's message. 
Marvin的坚韧令人惊讶，让许多人感到失望。他的奉献和忠诚源于他对我的父母个人的忠诚和他的激情，将我父亲的信息的完整性和力量展示在屏幕上。
In the late '70s, Marvin began to include me informally in the process of the film development.This became very cathartic for me. I accompanied him to meetings with prospective directors andwriters. Shortly thereafter, I began reading through different drafts submitted, and I recall himtelling me, "Some of them are overwriting. They are trying to 'create' Malcolm as the hero. I justtold them to start from scratch; if you write honestly, the hero will emerge." 
在70年代末，Marvin开始非正式地让我参与电影开发的过程。这对我来说非常宣泄。我陪他去见潜在的导演和作家。不久之后，我开始阅读提交的不同草稿，我记得他对我说：“有些剧本是过度写作。他们试图把马尔科姆塑造成英雄。我只是告诉他们从头开始写；如果你诚实地写，英雄就会浮现出来。”
Those who knew Malcolm X Shabazz personally wanted to be sure that the negative myth aroundhis memory would be erased by portraying the truths of his mission, and the depth of his heart. 
那些亲自了解马尔科姆·X·沙巴兹的人希望通过展现他使命的真相和内心的深度，确保围绕着他的记忆的负面神话被抹去。
Finally, it was the right time. In 1991, without any further delays, the deal to make the film of myfather's life came through. A long-awaited dream was to be realized. But before it made it to thescreen, we lost Alex. 
最终，时机成熟了。1991年，没有任何进一步的延迟，制作我父亲生平电影的交易终于达成了。一个长期等待的梦想终于实现了。但在它呈现在大屏幕之前，我们失去了Alex。
My father, James Baldwin, Arnold Perl, and my godfather, Alex Haley, were all with us in spirit asmy mother, her daughters, and Marvin Worth journeyed forth toward the final realization of thishistory-making film, which not only made it come to life, it ignited a cultural phenomenon. 
我的父亲、詹姆斯·鲍德温、阿诺德·珀尔和我的神父亚历克斯·海利都以精神与我们在一起，当我的母亲、她的女儿和Marvin Worth一起走向这部具有历史意义的电影的最终实现时。这部电影不仅让它栩栩如生，还引发了一场文化现象。
During this period, total sales of _The Autobiography of Malcolm X_ reached record numbers.Nearly 3 million copies have been sold worldwide. At least twenty new literary works that used myfather's life as a subject appeared on bookshelves. Young males, newly born, were being namedMalcolm, Malik, and Omowale after my father. His philosophy, speeches, and life transitions werenow being adopted by a whole new generation of youngsters, internationally. 
在此期间，《马尔科姆·X自传》的全球销量达到了创纪录的数字。全球售出了近300万本。至少有20部以我父亲的生活为主题的新文学作品出现在书架上。年轻的男性，新生代，在我的父名下被命名为Malcolm、Malik和Omowale。他的哲学、演讲和生活转变现在被新一代年轻人，国际上所接受。
 Adult appreciators were coming out of the closet, waving their Malcolm banners boldly. BothAmerican and foreign students utilized him as their prototype for human development, spiritualdedication, and equality. 
成年爱好者们纷纷走出来，大胆地挥舞着马尔科姆的旗帜。无论是美国还是外国的学生都以他为人类发展、精神奉献和平等的典范。
Parents of the '90s were not as apprehensive as the parents of the '60s, '70s, and '80s. Instead,as their many letters and comments informed me, they were relieved that at a stage when theirchildren's discipline and social mores were being challenged, their son or daughter had claimedcharacteristics and habits associated with Malcolm's. 
90年代的父母不像60、70和80年代的父母那样担心。相反，正如他们许多信件和评论告诉我的那样，他们放心了，当他们的孩子在纪律和社会习俗方面受到挑战时，他们的孩子已经拥有了与马尔科姆相关联的特点和习惯。
Psychologists, professors, journalists, and critics rediscovered Malcolm X for review and generalanalysis. New documentaries unfolded, revealing film footage long existing yet previously editedfrom cultural consumption. 
心理学家、教授、记者和评论家们重新发现了马尔科姆·X,进行回顾和分析。新的纪录片展开，揭示了长期存在的电影片段，但之前被编辑从文化消费中删除了。
The sensations, passions, and sincerities of this black American crusader, plus his new crossoverand international marketability, now challenged all the preceding assessments of twentieth- century historians, social experts, the media, and most pointedly our government. 
这位黑人美国斗士的感受、热情和真诚，加上他的新跨界和国际市场潜力，现在挑战了所有先前对20世纪历史学家、社会专家、媒体和政府的评估。
The resurrection of Malcolm X also precipitated a new wave of unauthorized exploitation of hisimage. In the early days-the '60s, '70s, and '80s, before my father's likeness had become alicensed commodity-my mother didn't mind the bootlegged T-shirts, cassette tapes, and framedphotos being sold at various events around the country during his birthday, Black History Month,and the like. In those years she felt it was one of the pulses that kept Malcolm alive on campuses,in community centers, and on cultural occasions. As a mother and educator, she was comfortedby the thought that such remembrances would enable young people to have an opportunity to beexposed to her husband, ask questions, learn, and achieve. Pass it on! 
马尔科姆·X的复活也引发了一波对他形象的未经授权的利用。在早年-60年代、70年代和80年代，在我父亲的形象成为一种许可商品之前-我的母亲不介意非法销售T恤、磁带和照片，这些产品在全国各地的各种活动上出售，包括他的生日、黑人历史月等等。在那些年里，她觉得这是让马尔科姆在校园、社区中心和文化场合保持活力的一种方式。作为一个母亲和教育家，她感到安慰的是，这样的纪念可以让年轻人有机会接触到我丈夫，提问、学习并取得进步。传递下去！
When people commented on the exploitation, she'd generously reply, "It's love that's making themdo this for my husband." 
当人们评论这种利用时，她会慷慨地回复：“这是因为爱让他们为我丈夫做这些事情。”
On the other hand, if the intentions of the merchant were not honorable, you'd better believe thatshe'd be heading in their direction to inform them of their malfeasance and impropriety. It wasimperative to my mother that the memory of her husband be respected with the honor she knewhe deserved. It was not okay to mistreat her husband. _Not okay_. In his absence, for more thanthirty years, she tirelessly guarded his legacy and fought to ensure that his ideology was clear.For her, it was essential that if she was going to lose her lifemate to the struggle, then those forwhom he had struggled must be educated. They must be made aware of the conviction,dedication, and sacrifices he made on behalf of his faith in humanity and his mission to unite usas one community, certain of our inherent right to our own destiny. My mother took note of anyonewho maligned any characteristic of her husband or anything associated with him. 
另一方面，如果商人的意图不道德，你最好相信她会朝他们的方向走去，告诉他们他们的不当行为和不合适之处。对我母亲来说，尊重她丈夫的记忆是非常重要的，因为她知道他应该得到的荣誉。对她来说，对待丈夫的方式是不好的，不好的。在他离开后的30多年里，她不懈地保护他的遗产，并努力确保他的思想是明确的。对她来说，如果她要失去她的伴侣去斗争，那么那些他为之奋斗的人必须受到教育。他们必须了解他为代表他对人类的信仰和将我们团结在一起的任务所做出的信念、奉献和牺牲。我的母亲关注任何诋毁她丈夫或与他的任何事情相关的人。
To my mother, Malcolm X Shabazz was reserved for herself, her children, and the many persons,young and mature, who have been fortified, caressed, and inspired to employ aspects of myfather's life lessons and personal discoveries as a bridge to their own inner strength and as afoundation for their "personhood." 
对我母亲来说，马尔科姆·X·沙巴兹是留给她自己、她的孩子和许多年轻人和成年人的。这些人被加强、抚慰和启发，将我父亲的生活教训和个人发现作为他们内在力量的桥梁，并将其作为他们“人格”的基础。
"Personhood" is a word I first heard as I listened to the eloquence of Brother Randall Robinson,president of the TransAfrica Forum, during his remarks at the Apollo commemoration. While he isa generation younger than my father, both he and his elder brother Max always symbolized agenuine and authentic continuity throughout the struggle. They are men of their word, like HakiMadhubuti, Kweisi Mfume, and Danny Glover-the few in their generation who say it, mean it, andlive it. Thank God for them as they continue to make certain that my father's beat goes on. 
“人格”这个词是我第一次听到，是在我听TransAfrica论坛主席Randall Robinson在阿波罗纪念活动上的讲话时。尽管他比我父亲年轻一代，但他和他的哥哥Max总是象征着在整个斗争中真实和持续的年龄。他们都是说到做到的人，就像Haki Madhubuti、Kweisi Mfume和Danny Glover一样-他们是那个时代的少数几个说到就做到并且真正实践的人。感谢上帝因为他们继续确保我父亲的事业继续进行下去。
 "I grew up in the Old South in Richmond, Virginia," said Brother Randall Robinson. 
“我在一个叫做Richmond的维吉尼亚州老南方长大。”Randall Robinson说道。
"I am one of the unfortunate millions who never knew or met Malcolm X. 
“我是那些不幸的百万人之一，从未见过或遇到过马尔科姆·X。”Randall Robinson说道。
"So perhaps I can presume to speak for those millions like me, then and now, when I say thatMalcolm X was a shining model for a new, whole, and proud black personhood. 
“所以或许我可以代表那些和我一样不幸的人，包括现在和那时的人，说马尔科姆·X是一个崭新的、完整的、自豪的黑人人格的典范。”Randall Robinson说道。
"_Before_ we in the South could see through the mean veil of Southern segregation-there wasMalcolm X. 
在我们南方人看透南方隔离的卑鄙面具之前-马尔科姆·X就在那里。
"_Before_ we could function beyond the humiliation of Southern bigotry-there was Malcolm X. 
在我们能够摆脱南方偏见的羞辱，发挥作用之前-马尔科姆·X就在那里。
"_Before_ we could come to know Africa's glorious past-there was Malcolm X. 
在我们能够了解非洲辉煌的过去之前-马尔科姆·X就在那里。
"_Before_ we could find our self-esteem and self-respect-there was Malcolm X. 
在我们能够找到自尊和自信之前-马尔科姆·X就在那里。
"And we owe him so dearly in ways our young must never be allowed to forget. 
我们必须永远铭记他对我们年轻人的贡献。
"Where we have now the very possibility of courage-we _owe_ Malcolm X. 
我们现在有了勇气的可能，我们欠马尔科姆·X的债。
"Where we have the wisdom to search for our history before the Atlantic slave trade-we _owe_Malcolm X. 
我们现在有了在大西洋奴隶贸易之前寻找我们历史的智慧，我们欠马尔科姆·X的债。
"Where we have the political integrity to simply stand for something because it is right-we _owe_Malcolm X. 
我们现在有了因为它是正确的而简单地站出来支持某些事情的政治正直，我们欠马尔科姆·X的债。
"It is not often that an American government institution honors those who embody a whole anduncompromised truth. But today is one such rare occasion. And I will keep it in my heart for therest of my life." 
一个美国政府机构很少会表彰那些体现完整和不可妥协真理的人。但今天是一个罕见的机会。我将一生珍藏在心中。
*     *     * 
At that moment, Brother Robinson spoke for all of us, and I will forever carry in my heart thesincerities of that ceremony. In particular, I will remember that as my five younger sisters and Igathered onstage for Harry Belafonte's closing remarks, I remained full. As I listened to the finalnotes sung by the Boys Choir of Harlem their song's message still lingered in my heart: "All blackboys are born of heroes." 
在那一刻，Randall Robinson代表了我们所有人，我将永远铭记那个仪式的诚挚。特别是，我会记得当我和我的五个妹妹一起在舞台上听Harry Belafonte的结束语时，我感到非常充实。当我听着哈莱姆男孩合唱团演唱的最后一首歌曲时，他们歌曲的信息仍然在我心中徘徊：“所有黑人男孩都出生在英雄的怀抱中。”
I thought of my father and his parents, my mother and her parents, each family's respectivelineage and history of participation in social movements-Garvey on one side and Booker T.Washington on the other. I thought of my sisters and I standing there, parentless, yet in constantcelebration of our parents' lives. We are blessed every day by the union and the victorioussojourns that Malcolm X Shabazz and his beloved Betty Saunders Shabazz shared on this earth. 
我想到了我的父亲和父母，我的母亲和她的父母，每个家族各自的谱系和参与社会运动的历史-一边是Garvey,另一边是Booker T.Washington。 我想到了我和我的姐妹站在那里，没有父母，但却不断庆祝我们父母的生命。我们每天都受到马尔科姆·X·沙巴兹和他的心爱之人贝蒂·桑德斯·沙巴兹在这个世界上分享的团结和胜利的祝福。
When I first realized that my mother wouldn't be here to witness her husband's likeness beingunveiled on a United States postal stamp, after participating in the initial discussions, a lonely tearbegan to slip down my cheek. But then it dawned on me that she wasn't missing the occasion. Infact, she had the best seat in the house. She is now where she longed to be. Beside herhusband. And together they are toasting our healthy continuance and productive lives. 
当我第一次意识到我的母亲不会在这里见证她丈夫的肖像被印在一张美国邮票上时，在参加初步讨论后，一滴孤独的泪水开始从我的眼角滑落。但随后我意识到她并没有错过这个时刻。事实上，她拥有最好的座位。她现在就在她一直渴望的地方。在她丈夫身边。他们一起举杯庆祝我们的健康延续和有成效的生活。
As their eldest, I have pledged time and again to care for their daughters, my younger sisters, intheir memory, in their honor, and with their celestial guidance. 
作为他们的长子，我一次又一次地发誓要照顾他们的女儿，我的妹妹们，以此来纪念他们，为他们感到骄傲，并在他们的指导下继续前进。
 When the curtain descends on this current wave of attention and the thematic celebrations cooldown, my sisters and I will remain proud. Proud of a man and his wife, proud of a cause and aheartbeat that was a metronome for us long before the crossover audience considered themworthy of praise. We, the Shabazz daughters and our children, will forever be nurtured by ourlegacy. 
当这一波关注和主题庆祝活动的热潮退去时，我和我的姐妹们仍然会感到自豪。为一个人和他的妻子感到自豪，为一个事业和一个心跳感到自豪，这是我们很久以前就已经作为节拍器的东西，在观众认为它们值得赞美之前。我们是沙巴兹的女儿和我们的孩子，将永远受到我们遗产的滋养。
My inherent idealism yearns for the issuance of the commemorative stamp and the livingdocument of _The Autobiography of Malcolm X_ to continue to bridge ignorance with insight, anddespondency with hope. It is essential for people to trust-even through long periods when dreamsmay appear to have been deferred, delayed, and overshadowed-that there comes a time whenan unwavering will, a strong belief, and endless prayers bring great visions to realization. 
我内在的理想主义渴望发行纪念邮票和《马尔科姆·X自传》的活生生的文件，以继续用洞见来填补无知，用希望来克服沮丧。人们必须相信，即使在梦想似乎被推迟、延迟和掩盖了很长一段时间的时候，总会有一个坚定不移的意志、强烈的信念和无尽的祈祷将伟大的愿景变为现实的时候。
_The Autobiography of Malcolm X_ is evidence of one man's will and belief in prayer andpurpose. As you read my father's autobiography, whether for the first time or after a long absence,it is my hope that you will come to know him foremost as a man. A man who lived to serve-initiallya specific people, then a nation, and eventually all people of the world. Some have said that myfather was ahead of his time, but the truth is he was on time and perhaps we were late. I trust thatthrough his words we may come to honor and respect all members of the human family as he did.In closing, I offer you my father's own words: "One day, may we all meet together in the light ofunderstanding." 
《马尔科姆·X自传》是一个人意志和信仰的见证，他相信祈祷和目的。当你阅读我父亲的自传时，无论你是第一次还是长时间没有接触过，我希望你能首先了解他是一个怎样的人。一个为了服务而生活的人，最初是为了特定的人群，然后是为了整个国家，最终是为了全世界所有的人。有人说我的父亲走在时代的前面，但事实是他是在正确的时间里，也许我们有些迟到了。我相信通过他的话语，我们可以像他一样尊重并敬重人类大家庭的所有成员。最后，我想引用我父亲自己的话：“总有一天，我们会因为理解而相聚在一起。”
M. S. HANDLER 
M.S. HANDLER (马丁·路德·金博士)
INTRODUCTION 
介绍
The Sunday before he was to officially announce his rupture with ElijahMuhammad, Malcolm Xcame to my home to discuss his plans and give me some necessary documentation. 
在他正式宣布与伊利亚·穆罕默德决裂的前一个星期天，马尔科姆·X来到了我家，讨论他的计划并给了我一些必要的文件。
Mrs. Handler had never met Malcolm before this fateful visit. She served us coffee and cakeswhile Malcolm spoke in the courteous, gentle manner that was his in private. It was obvious to methat Mrs. Handler was impressed by Malcolm. His personality filled our living room. 
在这次命运般的访问之前，霍德勒夫人从未见过马尔科姆。她为我们倒咖啡和蛋糕，而马尔科姆以他一贯的礼貌、温和的方式发言。很明显，霍德勒夫人对马尔科姆印象深刻。他的个性充满了我们的客厅。
Malcolm's attitude was that of a man who had reached a crossroads in his life and was making achoice under an inner compulsion. A wistful smile illuminated his countenance from time to time-asmile that said many things. I felt uneasy because Malcolm was evidently trying to say somethingwhich his pride and dignity prevented him from expressing. I sensed that Malcolm was notconfident he would succeed in escaping from the shadowy world which had held him in thrall. 
马尔科姆的态度就像是一个在人生十字路口的人，他正在内心的驱使下做出选择。他的面容不时地露出一丝渴望的微笑 - 那种微笑意味着许多事情。我感到不安，因为马尔科姆显然想说一些话，但他的骄傲和尊严阻止了他表达出来。我能感觉到马尔科姆并不自信能够成功地逃离一直束缚着他的阴影世界。
Mrs. Handler was quiet and thoughtful after Malcolm's departure. Looking up suddenly, she said: 
马尔科姆离开后，霍德勒夫人沉默而深思。突然抬起头来，她说：
"You know, it was like having tea with a black panther." 
“你知道吗，和黑豹一起喝茶就像是这样。”
The description startled me. The black panther is an aristocrat in the animal kingdom. He isbeautiful. He is dangerous. As a man, Malcolm X had the physical bearing and the inner self- confidence of a born aristocrat. And he was potentially dangerous. No man in our time arousedfear and hatred in the white man as did Malcolm, because in him the white man sensed animplacable foe who could not be had for any price-a man unreservedly committed to the cause ofliberating the black man in American society rather than integrating the black man into thatsociety. 
这个描述让我感到震惊。黑豹是动物王国中的贵族，他美丽而危险。作为一个人，马尔科姆·X具有天生的贵族风度和内在的自信。他也可能是危险的。在我们的时代里，没有人像马尔科姆那样激起了白人的恐惧和仇恨，因为在他身上，白人感觉到了一个无法用任何代价获得的敌人 - 一个毫不保留地致力于解放美国社会中黑人的人，而不是将黑人融入那个社会。
My first meeting with Malcolm X took place in March 1963 in the Muslim restaurant of TempleNumber Seven on Lenox Avenue. I had been assigned by _The New York Times_ to investigatethe growing pressures within the Negro community. Thirty years of experience as a reporter inWestern and Eastern Europe had taught me that the forces in a developing social struggle arefrequently buried beneath the visible surface and make themselves felt in many ways long beforethey burst out into the open. These generative forces make themselves felt through the power ofan idea long before their organizational forms can openly challenge the establishment. It is themerit of European political scientists and sociologists to give a high priority to the power of ideasin a social struggle. In the United States, it is our weakness to confuse the numerical strength ofan organization and the publicity attached to leaders with the germinating forces that sow theseeds of social upheaval in our community. 
我第一次与马尔科姆·X见面是在1963年3月，地点是列克星敦大道上的第七寺庙穆斯林餐厅。我被《纽约时报》派去调查黑人社区内日益增长的压力。我在西欧和东欧作为记者工作了30年，这让我了解到在发展中社会斗争中的力量经常隐藏在可见的表面之下，并以许多方式在爆发之前感受到它们。这些创造性的力量通过思想的力量来体现，而思想的形式在组织公开挑战现有制度之前就已经存在。欧洲政治科学家和社会学家重视社会斗争中思想的力量是很自然的事情。在美国，我们往往会将组织的数字实力和领导人的宣传与在我们社区中播下社会动荡种子的潜在力量混淆在一起，这是我们的弱点。
In studying the growing pressures within the Negro community, I had not only to seek theopinions of the established leaders of the civil rights organizations but the opinions of thoseworking in the penumbra of the movement-"underground," so to speak. This is why I sought outMalcolm X, whose ideas had reached me through the medium of Negro integrationists. Theirthinking was already reflecting a high degree of nascent Negro nationalism. 
在研究黑人社区日益增长的压力时，我不仅要寻求民权组织中已建立的领导人的意见，还要寻求那些在运动“地下”工作的人的意见和建议。这就是为什么我要寻找马尔科姆·X,他的观点是通过黑人融合主义者传达给我的。他们的思想已经反映了高度萌芽的黑人民族主义。
I did not know what to expect as I waited for Malcolm. I was the only white person in therestaurant, an immaculate establishment tended by somber, handsome, uncommunicativeNegroes. Signs reading "Smoking Forbidden" were pasted on the highly polished mirrors. I wasserved coffee but became uneasy in this aseptic, silent atmosphere as time passed. Malcolmfinally arrived. He was very tall, handsome, of impressive bearing. His skin had a bronze hue. 
我在等待马尔科姆时不知道会发生什么。我是唯一一个在餐厅里的白人，一个完美无瑕的场所，由沉默、英俊且不善言辞的黑人照料着。高光亮的镜子上贴着“禁止吸烟”的标志。我点了咖啡，但随着时间的流逝，在这个无菌、寂静的氛围中变得不安。最终马尔科姆到达了。他非常高大、英俊，有着令人印象深刻的风度。他的皮肤呈现出古铜色。
I rose to greet him and extended my hand. Malcolm's hand came up slowly. I had the impressionit was difficult for him to take my hand, but, _noblesse oblige_, he did. Malcolm then did a curiousthing which he always repeated whenever we met in public in a restaurant in New York orWashington. He asked whether I would mind if he took a seat facing the door. I had had similarrequests put to me in Eastern European capitals. Malcolm was on the alert; he wished to seeevery person who entered the restaurant. I quickly realized that Malcolm constantly walked indanger. 
我起身迎接他，并伸出手。马尔科姆的手慢慢地举了起来。我有一种印象，他很难握住我的手，但“君子之交淡如水”，他还是这样做了。然后马尔科姆做了一件奇怪的事情，每当我们在纽约或华盛顿的餐厅里公开见面时，他总是会重复这个动作。他问我是否介意他坐在面对门的位置上。我在东欧的一些首都也收到过类似的请求。马尔科姆非常警惕，他想看到进入餐厅的每一个人。我很快意识到，马尔科姆总是处于危险之中。
We spoke for more than three hours at this first encounter. His views about the white man weredevastating, but at no time did he transgress against my own personality and make me feel that I,as an individual, shared in the guilt. He attributed the degradation of the Negro people to thewhite man. He denounced integration as a fraud. He contended that if the leaders of theestablished civil rights organizations persisted, the social struggle would end in bloodshedbecause he was certain the white man would never concede full integration. He argued theMuslim case for separation as the only solution in which the Negro could achieve his own identity,develop his own culture, and lay the foundations for a self-respecting productive community. Hewas vague about where the Negro state could be established. 
我们在这个第一次见面中谈了超过三个小时。他对白人的看法是毁灭性的，但他从未侵犯过我的性格，也从未让我感到作为一个个体，我与这种罪行有关联。他把黑人的堕落归咎于白人。他谴责融合是一种骗局。他认为，如果民权组织的领导人坚持不懈，社会斗争将以流血收场，因为他确信白人永远不会完全接受融合。他为穆斯林的分离主张辩护，认为这是黑人实现自己的身份、发展自己的文化、并为一个自尊的有生产力的社区奠定基础的唯一解决方案。他对建立黑人国家的地方含糊不清。
Malcolm refused to see the impossibility of the white man conceding secession from the UnitedStates; at this stage in his * career he contended it was the only solution. He defended Islam as areligion that did not recognize color bars. He denounced Christianity as a religion designed forslaves and the Negro clergy as the curse of the black man, exploiting him for their own purposesinstead of seeking to liberate him, and acting as handmaidens of the white community in itsdetermination to keep the Negroes in a subservient position. 
马尔科姆拒绝承认白人放弃美国分裂的可能性；在他职业生涯的这个阶段，他认为这是唯一的解决办法。他捍卫伊斯兰教，因为它是一个不承认肤色差异的宗教。他谴责基督教是一种为奴隶设计的宗教，黑人牧师是黑人的诅咒，他们利用黑人为自己谋取利益，而不是寻求解放他们，并在决定让黑人处于从属地位上充当白人社会的侍女。
During this first encounter Malcolm also sought to enlighten me about the Negro mentality. Herepeatedly cautioned me to beware of Negro affirmations of good will toward the white man. Hesaid that the Negro had been trained to dissemble and conceal his real thoughts, as a matter ofsurvival. He argued that the Negro only tells the white man what he believes the white manwishes to hear, and that the art of dissembling reached a point where even Negroes cannottruthfully say they understand what their fellow Negroes believe. The art of deception practiced bythe Negro was based on a thorough understanding of the white man's mores, he said; at thesame time the Negro has remained a closed book to the white man, who has never displayed anyinterest in understanding the Negro. 
在这次第一次见面中，马尔科姆还试图向我解释黑人的心态。他反复提醒我要警惕黑人对白人的善意表达。他说，黑人一直被训练成虚伪和掩饰真实想法，这是生存的需要。他认为，黑人只会告诉白人他们认为白人想听的话，而虚伪的技巧已经到了连黑人自己都不能真实地说出他们理解同族信仰的程度。他说，黑人所练习的欺骗艺术是基于对白人习俗的深入了解；与此同时，黑人对白人来说仍然是一本书，白人从来没有表现出过对他们的理解的兴趣。
Malcolm's exposition of his social ideas was clear and thoughtful, if somewhat shocking to thewhite initiate, but most disconcerting in our talk was Malcolm's belief in Elijah Muhammad'shistory of the origins of man, and in a genetic theory devised to prove the superiority of black overwhite-a theory stunning to me in its sheer absurdity. 
马尔科姆对他的社会理念的阐述清晰而深思熟虑，尽管对白人新手来说可能有些令人震惊，但在我们谈话中最令人不安的是马尔科姆对伊利亚·穆罕默德关于人类起源历史的信仰，以及一种旨在证明黑人优于白人的基因理论-这个理论对我来说是荒谬的，因为它完全不符合常理。
After this first encounter, I realized that there were two Malcolms-the private and the publicperson. His public performances on television and at meeting halls produced an almost terrifyingeffect. His implacable marshaling of facts and his logic had something of a new dialectic, diabolicin its force. He frightened white television audiences, demolished his Negro opponents, butelicited a remarkable response from Negro audiences. Many Negro opponents in the end refusedto make any public appearances on the same platform with him. The troubled white audienceswere confused, disturbed, felt themselves threatened. Some began to consider Malcolm evilincarnate. 
在这次第一次见面之后，我意识到马尔科姆有两个面貌 - 一个私人的和一个公众的。他在电视节目中和会议上的公开表现产生了一种几乎可怕的效果。他无情地整理事实和逻辑，有一种新的辩证法，带有魔鬼般的力量。他吓坏了白人电视观众，摧毁了他的黑人对手，但却引发了黑人观众的强烈反应。许多黑人对手最终拒绝与他在同一平台上公开露面。困扰的白人观众感到困惑、不安，觉得自己受到了威胁。有些人开始认为马尔科姆是邪恶的化身。
Malcolm appealed to the two most desparate elements in the Negro community-the depressedmass, and the galaxy of o Negro writers and artists who have burst on the American scene in thepast decade. The Negro middle class-the Negro "establishment"-abhorred and feared Malcolm asmuch as he despised it. 
马尔科姆呼吁黑人社区中最为绝望的两个元素 - 受挫的大众和过去十年在美洲出现的众多黑人作家和艺术家星群。黑人中产阶级，即黑人“上层”社会，像马尔科姆所憎恶的一样，也憎恶和害怕他。
The impoverished Negroes respected Malcolm in the way that wayward children respect thegrandfather image. It was always a strange and moving experience to walk with Malcolm inHarlem. He was known to all. People glanced at him shyly. Sometimes Negro youngsters wouldask for his autograph. It always seemed to me that their affection for Malcolm was inspired by thefact that although he had become a national figure, he was still a man of the people who, theyfelt, would never betray them. The Negroes have suffered too long from betrayals and in Malcolmthey sensed a man of mission. They knew his origins, with which they could identify. They knewhis criminal and prison record, which he had never concealed. They looked upon Malcolm with acertain wonderment. Here was a man who had come from the lower depths which they stillinhabited, who had triumphed over his own criminality and his own ignorance to become aforceful leader and spokesman, an uncompromising champion of his people. 
贫困的黑人以一种孩子对祖父的尊敬方式尊重马尔科姆。在哈莱姆与马尔科姆一起走路总是一次奇怪而感人的体验。他为人所知，人们会害羞地看着他。有时，一些黑人青年会请求他的签名。在我看来，他们对马尔科姆的喜爱是受到了这样一个事实的启发：尽管他已经成为了全国性的人物，但他仍然是一个属于人民的人，他们相信他不会背叛他们。黑人已经遭受了太久的背叛，在马尔科姆身上，他们感受到了一个肩负使命的人。他们了解他的出身背景，这使他们能够认同。他们知道他的犯罪和监狱记录，而他从未隐瞒过这些。黑人们对马尔科姆怀有某种敬畏之情。这是一个从他们依然居住的底层崛起的人，他战胜了自己的犯罪和无知，成为了一位强大的领袖和发言人，一个不妥协的人民捍卫者。
Although many could not share his Muslim religious beliefs, they found in Malcolm's puritanism astanding reproach to their own lives. Malcolm had purged himself of all the ills that afflict thedepressed Negro mass: drugs, alcohol, tobacco, not to speak of criminal pursuits. His personallife was impeccable-of a puritanism unattainable for the mass. Human redemption-Malcolm hadachieved it in his own lifetime, and this was known to the Negro community. 
虽然许多人无法分享他的穆斯林宗教信仰，但他们发现马尔科姆的清教徒主义是对他们自己生活的指责。马尔科姆清除了自己身上所有困扰着沮丧的黑人群众的问题：毒品、酒精、烟草，更不用说犯罪行为了。他个人的生活无可挑剔 - 一种对大众来说不可达到的清教徒精神。人类救赎 - 马尔科姆在他自己的一生中实现了这一点，这是众所周知的黑人社区。
In his television appearances and at public meetings Malcolm articulated the woes and theaspirations of the depressed Negro mass in a way it was unable to do for itself. When he attackedthe white man, Malcolm did for the Negroes what they couldn't do for themselves-he attackedwith a violence and anger that spoke for the ages of misery. It was not an academic exercise ofjust giv ing hell to "Mr. Charlie." 
在电视节目和公开会议上，马尔科姆以一种黑人群众无法自我表达的方式阐述了他们的痛苦和愿望。当他攻击白人时，马尔科姆为黑人做了他们自己无法做到的事情 - 他的攻击充满了暴力和愤怒，代表着无尽的痛苦。这不仅仅是为了“查理先生”而发泄怒火的学术性行为。
Many of the Negro writers and artists who are national figures today revered Malcolm for whatthey considered his ruthless honesty in stating the Negro case, his refusal to compromise, andhis search for a group identity that had been destroyed by the white man when he brought theNegroes in chains from Africa. The Negro writers and artists regarded Malcolm as the greatcatalyst, the man who inspired self-respect and devotion in the downtrodden millions. 
今天，许多黑人作家和艺术家都是全国性的人物，他们尊敬马尔科姆，因为他们认为他在陈述黑人的情况时表现出了无情的诚实、拒绝妥协以及寻找被白人从非洲带到美洲的奴隶摧毁的群体认同。黑人作家和艺术家把马尔科姆视为伟大的催化剂，他激励着受压迫的数百万人民自尊和忠诚。
A group of these artists gathered one Sunday in my home, and we talked about Malcolm. Theirdevotion to him as a man was moving. One said: "Malcolm will never betray us. We have sufferedtoo much from betrayals in the past." 
一个周日，一群艺术家聚集在我家，我们谈论马尔科姆。他们对他作为人的忠诚令人感动。一位说：“马尔科姆永远不会背叛我们。我们过去受到的背叛太多了。”
Malcolm's attitude toward the white man underwent a marked change in 1964-a change thatcontributed to his break with Elijah Muhammad and his racist doctrines. Malcolm's meteoriceruption on the national scene brought him into wider contact with white men who were not the"devils" he had thought they were. He was much in demand as a speaker at student forums inEastern universities and had appeared at many by the end of his short career as a national figure.He always spoke respectfully and with a certain surprise of the positive response of whitestudents to his lectures. 
马尔科姆对白人的态度在1964年发生了明显的变化，这一变化促成了他与伊利亚·穆罕默德的决裂和他的种族主义信条。马尔科姆在国家舞台上的突然崛起使他与那些不是他所认为的“恶魔”的白人有了更广泛的接触。他在东海岸大学的学生论坛上备受追捧，并在他的短暂的国家形象生涯结束之前多次露面。他总是以一种尊重和惊讶的方式说话，对他的讲座获得白人学生的积极回应感到惊喜。
A second factor that contributed to his conversion to wider horizons was a growing doubt aboutthe authenticity of Elijah Muhammad's version of the Muslim religion-a doubt that grew into acertainty with more knowledge and more experience. Certain secular practices at the Chicagoheadquarters of Elijah Muhammad had come to Malcolm's notice and he was profoundlyshocked. 
马尔科姆转向更广阔的视野的第二个因素是他对伊利亚·穆罕默德所解释的伊斯兰教真实性的怀疑 - 这种怀疑随着更多的知识和经验而逐渐变成确定性。在芝加哥伊利亚·穆罕默德总部的一些世俗做法引起了马尔科姆的注意，他对此感到非常震惊。
Finally, he embarked on a number of prolonged trips to Mecca and the newly independent Africanstates through the good offices of the representatives of the Arab League in the United States. Itwas on his first trip to Mecca that he came to the conclusion that he had yet to discover Islam. 
最终，他通过阿拉伯联盟驻美国的代表的斡旋，开始了前往麦加和新独立的非洲国家的长期旅行。在他的第一次麦加之旅中，他得出了这样的结论：他还没有发现伊斯兰教。
Assassins' bullets ended Malcolm's career before he was able to develop this new approach,which in essence recognized the Negroes as an integral part of the American community-a far cryfrom Elijah Muhammad's doctrine of separation. Malcolm had reached the midpoint in redefininghis attitude to this country and the white-black relationship. He no longer inveighed against theUnited States but against a segment of the United States represented by overt whitesupremacists in the South and covert white supremacists in the North. 
刺客的子弹在马尔科姆能够发展出这种新方法之前结束了他的职业生涯，这种方法本质上承认黑人为美国社区的一部分 - 这与伊利亚·穆罕默德的分离主义教义相去甚远。马尔科姆在他的重新定义对这个国家和白人黑人关系的态度方面已经达到了中点。他不再抨击美国，而是反对南方那些公开的白人至上主义者和北方那些隐蔽的白人至上主义者所代表的美国部分。
It was Malcolm's intention to raise Negro militancy to a new high point with the main thrust aimedat both the Southern and Northern white supremacists. The Negro problem, which he had alwayssaid should be renamed "the white man's problem," was beginning to assume new dimensions forhim in the last months of his life. 
马尔科姆打算将黑人战斗精神提高到一个新的高度，主要针对南方和北方的白人至上主义者。他一直说黑人问题应该被重新命名为“白人的问题”，这个问题在他生命的最后几个月里开始对他呈现出新的意义。
To the very end, Malcolm sought to refashion the broken strands between the American Negroesand African culture. He saw in this the road to a new sense of group identity, a self-conscious rolein history, and above all a sense of man's own worth which he claimed the white man haddestroyed in the Negro. 
马尔科姆一直努力重新塑造美国黑人与非洲文化之间的断裂。他认为这是通向新的群体认同感、自觉的历史角色以及最重要的是对人类自身价值的新认识的途径，而这种价值在他看来是白人摧毁了黑人的。
American autobiographical literature is filled with numerous accounts of remarkable men whopulled themselves to the summit by their bootstraps. Few are as poignant as Malcolm's memoirs.As testimony to the power of redemption and the force of human personality, the autobiography ofMalcolm X is a revelation. 
美国自传体文学充满了许多通过自己的努力达到顶峰的杰出人物的描述。马尔科姆的回忆录很少有如此感人的。作为赎罪力量和人类个性的力量的证明，马尔科姆X的自传是一个启示。

纽约，1965年6月
CHAPTER ONE 
第一章
NIGHTMARE 
噩梦
When my mother was pregnant with me, she told me later, a party of hooded Ku Klux Klan ridersgalloped up to our home in Omaha, Nebraska, one night. Surrounding the house, brandishingtheir shotguns and rifles, they shouted for my father to come out. My mother went to the frontdoor and opened it. Standing where they could see her pregnant condition, she told them that shewas alone with her three small children, and that my father was away, preaching, in Milwaukee.The Klansmen shouted threats and warnings at her that we had better get out of town because"the good Christian white people" were not going to stand for my father's "spreading trouble"among the "good" Negroes of Omaha with the "back to Africa" preachings of Marcus Garvey. 
当我的母亲怀着我的时候，她后来告诉我，有一天晚上一群带着面罩的三K党骑手奔向了我们在内布拉斯加州奥马哈市的家。他们手持霰弹枪和步枪包围着房子，喊着要我父亲出来。我的母亲走向前门打开了它。站在他们可以看见她怀孕的地方，她告诉他们她独自和三个年幼的孩子在一起，而我的父亲正在密尔沃基传教。三K党成员对她发出威胁和警告，说我们最好离开这个城市，因为“善良的基督教白人”不会容忍我父亲在奥马哈的“善良的”黑人之间宣扬“回归非洲”的马库斯·加维教义并制造麻烦。
My father, the Reverend Earl Little, was a Baptist minister, a dedicated organizer for MarcusAurelius Garvey's U.N.I.A. (Universal Negro Improvement Association). With the help of suchdisciples as my father, Garvey, from his headquarters in New York City's Harlem, was raising thebanner of black-race purity and exhorting the Negro masses to return to their ancestral Africanhomeland-a cause which had made Garvey the most controversial black man on earth. 
我的父亲，厄尔·利特尔牧师是一位浸信会教士，也是马库斯·奥瑞利乌斯·加维在联合国(Universal Negro Improvement Association)的忠实组织者。在父亲等信徒的帮助下，加维从他在纽约市哈莱姆区的总部开始宣扬黑人纯洁的旗帜，并鼓励黑人群众回到他们祖先的非洲家园。这一事业使加维成为地球上最具争议的黑人之一。
Still shouting threats, the Klansmen finally spurred their horses and galloped around the house,shattering every window pane with their gun butts. Then they rode off into the night, their torchesflaring, as suddenly as they had come. 
三K党成员仍然大喊着威胁，最终催促他们的马匹绕着房子奔驰，用枪托打碎了每一个窗户。然后他们骑上马，在黑暗中消失，火把在他们身后闪烁，就像他们来的时候一样突然。
My father was enraged when he returned. He decided to wait until I was born-which would besoon-and then the family would move. I am not sure why he made this decision, for he was not afrightened Negro, as most then were, and many still are today. My father was a big, six-foot-four,very black man. He had only one eye. How he had lost the other one I have never known. He wasfrom Reynolds, Georgia, where he had left school after the third or maybe fourth grade. Hebelieved, as did Marcus Garvey, that freedom, independence and self-respect could never beachieved by the Negro in America, and that therefore the Negro should leave America to thewhite man and return to his African land of origin. Among the reasons my father had decided torisk and dedicate his life to help disseminate this philosophy among his people was that he hadseen four of his six brothers die by violence, three of them killed by white men, including one bylynching. What my father could not know then was that of the remaining three, including himself,only one, my Uncle Jim, would die in bed, of natural causes. Northern white police were later toshoot my Uncle Oscar. And my father was finally himself to die by the white man's hands. 
我父亲回来时非常愤怒。他决定等到我出生后再搬走-这很快就会发生-然后全家人就会搬到别的地方去。我不知道他为什么做出这个决定，因为他并不是像当时大多数黑人那样害怕的黑人，今天仍然有很多人是如此。我的父亲是一个高大的男人，身高六英尺四英寸，非常黑。他只有一只眼睛。我不知道他是如何失去另一只眼睛的。他来自佐治亚州的罗兹，那里他只上了三四年级就辍学了。他相信，就像马库斯·加维一样，黑人在美国的自由、独立和自尊永远无法实现，因此黑人应该离开美国，回到他们非洲的原籍地。我父亲决定冒着风险，将他的生命奉献给帮助传播这种哲学的原因之一是他亲眼目睹了他的六个兄弟中有四个死于暴力，其中三个被白人杀害，包括一个被私刑处决的人。那时我父亲不知道的是，在剩下的三个兄弟中，包括他自己在内，只有一个，我的叔叔吉姆会因自然原因而死在床上。后来北方的白人警察开枪打死了我的叔叔奥斯卡。最终，我的父亲也死在了白人的手中。
It has always been my belief that I, too, will die by violence. I have done all that I can to beprepared. 
我一直认为我也会死于暴力，所以我已经尽我所能做好了准备。
I was my father's seventh child. He had three children by a previous marriage-Ella, Earl, andMary, who lived in Boston. He had met and married my mother in Philadelphia, where their firstchild, my oldest full brother; Wilfred, was born. They moved from Philadelphia to Omaha, whereHilda and then Philbert were born. 
我是我父亲的第七个孩子。他之前有过三个孩子，分别叫Ella、Earl和Mary,他们住在波士顿。他和我母亲在费城相识并结婚，他们的第一个孩子，我的大哥哥Wilfred,在那里出生。之后他们从费城搬到了奥马哈，Hilda和Philbert也在那里出生。
I was next in line. My mother was twenty-eight when I was born on May  19, 1925, in an Omahahospital. Then we moved to Milwaukee, where Reginald was born. From infancy, he had somekind of hernia condition which was to handicap him physically for the rest of his life. 
我是下一个。我母亲在我1925年5月19日出生时已经28岁了，当时我在奥马哈的一家医院出生。之后我们搬到了密尔沃基，在那里雷金纳德出生。从小他就有一种疝气的情况，这会使他的身体在余生中受到一些限制。
Louise Little, my mother, who was born in Grenada, in the British West Indies, looked like a whitewoman. Her father was white. She had straight black hair, and her accent did not sound like aNegro's. Of this white father of hers, I know nothing except her shame about it. I rememberhearing her say she was glad that she had never seen him. It was, of course, because of him thatI got my reddish-brown "mariny" color of skin, and my hair of the same color. I was the lightestchild in our family. (Out in the world later on, in Boston and New York, I was among the millions ofNegroes who were insane enough to feel that it was some kind of status symbol to be lightcomplexioned-that one was actually fortunate to be born thus. But, still later, I learned to hateevery drop of that white rapist's blood that is in me.) 
我母亲Louise Little出生在英属西印度群岛的格林纳达，看起来像个白人。她的父亲是白人。她有一头直黑的头发，说话的口音不像黑人。关于她那个白人父亲，我只知道一些她的羞耻感。我记得听她说她很高兴从来没有见过他。这当然是因为我才有了这种红褐色的“mariny”肤色和相同颜色的头发。我是家里最轻的孩子。(后来在波士顿和纽约这个世界上，我是数百万黑人中的一员，他们疯狂地认为浅色的皮肤是一种地位象征-实际上很幸运能生来如此。但更晚的时候，我学会了憎恨那滴白人强奸犯的血液在我体内。)
Our family stayed only briefly in Milwaukee, for my father wanted to find a place where he couldraise our own food and perhaps build a business. The teaching of Marcus Garvey stressedbecoming independent of the white man. We went next, for some reason, to Lansing, Michigan.My father bought a house and soon, as had been his pattern, he was doing free-lance Christianpreaching in local Negro Baptist churches, and during the week he was roaming about spreadingword of Marcus Garvey. 
我们一家人只在密尔沃基短暂停留了一段时间，因为我父亲想找一个地方可以自己种植食物，也许还可以开一家生意。马库斯·加维的教导强调要独立于白人。出于某种原因，我们接下来去了密歇根州的兰辛市。我的父亲买了一栋房子，很快他就像以往一样，在当地黑人浸信会教堂做自由传教士，而在一周里，他在各地传播马库斯·加维的消息。
He had begun to lay away savings for the store he had always wanted to own when, as always,some stupid local Uncle Tom Negroes began to funnel stories about his revolutionary beliefs tothe local white people. This time, the get-out-of-town threats came from a local hate society calledThe Black Legion. They wore black robes instead of white. Soon, nearly everywhere my fatherwent, Black Legionnaires were reveiling him as an "uppity nigger" for wanting to own a store, forliving outside the Lansing Negro district, for spreading unrest and dissention among "the goodniggers." 
他开始为一直想拥有的商店存钱时，就像往常一样，一些愚蠢的当地黑人叔叔汤姆开始将关于他革命信仰的故事传达给当地的白人。这一次，逃离城镇的威胁来自一个叫做“黑军团”的当地仇恨组织。他们穿着黑色长袍而不是白色。很快，我父亲去的几乎每个地方，都有黑军团成员将他揭发为一个“傲慢的黑鬼”，因为他想拥有一家商店，因为他在兰辛市的非裔地区外生活，因为他在“好黑鬼”之间散布不安和异议。
As in Omaha, my mother was pregnant again, this time with my youngest sister. Shortly afterYvonne was born came the nightmare night in 1929, my earliest vivid memory. I remember beingsuddenly snatched awake into a frightening confusion of pistol shots and shouting and smokeand flames. My father had shouted and shot at the two white men who had set the fire and wererunning away. Our home was burning down around us. We were lunging and bumping andtumbling all over each other trying to escape. My mother, with the baby in her arms, just made itinto the yard before the house crashed in, showering sparks. I remember we were outside in thenight in our underwear, crying and yelling our heads off. The white police and firemen came andstood around watching as the house burned down to the ground. 
和我父亲在奥马哈一样，我的母亲又怀孕了，这次是最小的女儿。1929年，Yvonne出生后不久，发生了一场噩梦般的夜晚，这是我最早、最清晰的记忆之一。我记得突然被枪声、喊叫、烟雾和火焰的恐惧和混乱惊醒。我的父亲大声喊叫着向两个放火逃跑的白人开枪。我们的房子正在燃烧。我们在慌乱中互相碰撞和摔倒，试图逃离。我母亲抱着婴儿，只来得及逃到院子里，房子就倒塌了，洒满了火花。我记得我们在夜里穿着内衣在外面哭泣和呼喊。白人警察和消防员来了，站在旁边看着房子被烧成灰烬。
My father prevailed on some friends to clothe and house us temporarily; then he moved us intoanother house on the outskirts of East Lansing. In those days Negroes weren't allowed after darkin East Lansing proper. There's where Michigan State University is located; I related all of this toan audience of students when I spoke there in January, 1963 (and had the first reunion in a longwhile with my younger brother, Robert, who was there doing postgraduate studies in psychology).I told them how East Lansing harassed us so much that we had to move again, this time twomiles out of town, into the country. This was where my father built for us with his own hands afour-room house. This is where I really begin to remember things-this home where I started togrow up. 
我父亲向一些朋友求助，暂时为我们提供衣服和住所。然后他把我们搬到了East Lansing郊区的另一栋房子里。在那些日子里，黑人在East Lansing市中心是不允许在晚上外出的。那里是密歇根州立大学所在地；我在1963年1月在那里向一群学生演讲时(并与弟弟罗伯特举行了很长时间以来的首次聚会，他在该校攻读心理学研究生课程),我向他们讲述了我们被East Lansing骚扰得如此之多，以至于我们不得不再次搬家，这次是两英里外的城镇外，进入乡村。这是我的父亲用自己的双手为我们建造的一个四室房子。这是我真正开始回忆起事情的地方-这个我开始成长的家庭。
After the fire, I remember that my father was called in and questioned about a permit for the pistolwith which he had shot at the white men who set the fire. I remember that the police were alwaysdropping by our house, shoving things around, "just checking" or "looking for a gun." The pistolthey were looking for-which they never found, and for which they wouldn't issue a permit-wassewed up inside a pillow. My father's .22 rifle and his shotgun, though, were right out in the open;everyone had them for hunting birds and rabbits and other game. 
火灾后，我记得我父亲被叫去接受询问，关于他用来向放火的白人开枪的手枪是否获得了许可证。我记得警察经常来到我们家，四处搜查东西，“只是检查一下”或“在找枪”。他们要找的手枪-他们从未找到，也不愿意为它发放许可证-藏在枕头里。但是我父亲的.22口径步枪和猎枪就放在露天处；每个人都有它们来打鸟、兔子和其他野生动物。
*     *     * 
After that, my memories are of the friction between my father and mother. They seemed to benearly always at odds. Sometimes my father would beat her. It might have had something to dowith the fact that my mother had a pretty good education. Where she got it I don't know. But aneducated woman, I suppose, can't resist the temptation to correct an uneducated man. Every nowand then, when she put those smooth words on him, he would grab her. 
在那之后，我的记忆中都是父母之间的摩擦。他们似乎总是处于矛盾之中。有时我的父亲会打她。这可能与我母亲受过良好教育有关。我不知道她从哪里得到了教育。但是一个受过教育的女人，我想，无法抵挡纠正一个未受过教育的男人的诱惑。偶尔当她用那些流畅的话语对他说话时，他会抓住她。
 My father was also belligerent toward all of the children, except me. The older ones he wouldbeat almost savagely if they broke any of his rules-and he had so many rules it was hard to knowthem all. Nearly all my whippings came from my mother. I've thought a lot about why. I actuallybelieve that as anti-white as my father was, he was subconsciously so afflicted with the whiteman's brainwashing of Negroes that he inclined to favor the light ones, and I was his lightestchild. Most Negro parents in those days would almost instinctively treat any lighter children betterthan they did the darker ones. It came directly from the slavery tradition that the "mulatto,"because he was visibly nearer to white, was therefore "better." 
我的父亲也对所有的孩子都很暴躁，除了我。年纪大一点的孩子如果违反了他的任何规定，他会几乎野蛮地打他们-他有太多的规定了，很难知道全部内容。几乎所有的打骂都是我母亲造成的。我一直在思考为什么。实际上我相信，尽管我父亲是反白人的，但他潜意识中受到了白人对黑人的洗脑，倾向于偏袒较白的孩子，而我是他最白的孩子。在那个时代，大多数黑人父母都会本能地对待更白的孩子更好一些，而不是更黑的孩子。这直接来自于奴隶制的传统，因为“混血儿”明显更接近白人，所以“更好”。
My two other images of my father are both outside the home. One was his role as a Baptistpreacher. He never pastored in any regular church of his own; he was always a "visitingpreacher." I remember especially his favorite sermon: "That little _black_ train is a-comin' . . . an'you better get all your business right!" I guess this also fit his association with the back-to-Africamovement, with Marcus Garvey's "Black Train Homeward." My brother Philbert, the one just olderthan me, loved church, but it confused and amazed me. I would sit goggle-eyed at my fatherjum ping and shouting as he preached, with the congregation jumping and shouting behind him,their souls and bodies devoted to singing and praying. Even at that young age, I just couldn'tbelieve in the Christian concept of Jesus as someone divine. And no religious person, until I wasa man in my twenties-and then in prison-could tell me anything. I had very little respect for mostpeople who represented religion. 
我父亲的另外两个形象都是在外面。一个是他作为浸信会牧师的角色。他从来没有在自己的教会里担任过牧师，他总是一个“巡回牧师”。我特别记得他最喜欢的讲道：“那辆小黑车就要来了......你最好把所有的事情都准备好！”我想这也符合他与回归非洲运动的联系，与马库斯·加维的“黑人火车回家”有关。我的弟弟菲尔伯特，比我年长一点，喜欢教堂，但这让我感到困惑和惊讶。我会坐在父亲面前，目瞪口呆地看着他跳跃、高喊着讲道，而在他身后的会众也在跳跃、高喊着，他们的心灵和身体都致力于唱歌和祈祷。即使在那个年纪，我都无法相信基督教中关于耶稣是神的概念。直到我在二十多岁时成为一个男人，然后在监狱里，没有一个有宗教信仰的人能告诉我任何事情。我对大多数代表宗教的人都没有多少尊重。
It was in his role as a preacher that my father had most contact with the Negroes of Lansing.Believe me when I tell you that those Negroes were in bad shape then. They are still in badshape-though in a different way. By that I mean that I don't know a town with a higher percentageof complacent and misguided so-called "middle-class" Negroes-the typical status-symbol- oriented, integration-seeking type of Negroes. Just recently, I was standing in a lobby attheUnited Nations talking with an African ambassador and his wife, when a Negro came up to meand said, "You know me?" I was a little embarrassed because I thought he was someone I shouldremember. It turned out that he was one of those bragging, self-satisfied, "middle-class" LansingNegroes. I wasn't ingratiated. He was the type who would never have been associated withAfrica, until the fad of having African friends became a status-symbol for "middle-class" Negroes. 
作为牧师，我父亲与兰辛的黑人接触最多。相信我，当我告诉你那时的黑人处境很糟糕时。他们现在仍然处于糟糕的状态-尽管以不同的方式。我的意思是我不知道有一个城市有更高的比例自满和误导的所谓“中产阶级”黑人-典型的地位象征型、寻求融合的黑人类型。就在最近，我在联合国的一个大厅里与一位非洲大使和他的妻子交谈，一个黑人走到我面前说：“你认识我吗？”我有点尴尬，因为我认为他应该是我要记住的人。结果是他就是那些吹嘘、自我满足的“中产阶级”兰辛黑人之一。我没有讨好他。他是那种永远不会与非洲联系在一起的人，直到拥有非洲朋友成为“中产阶级”黑人的时尚标志。
Back when I was growing up, the "successful" Lansing Negroes were such as waiters andbootblacks. To be a janitor at some downtown store was to be highly respected. The real "elite,"the "big shots," the "voices of the race," were the waiters at the Lansing Country Club and theshoeshine boys at the state capitol. The only Negroes who really had any money were the onesin the numbers racket, or who ran the gambling houses, or who in some other way livedparasitically off the poorest ones, who were the masses. No Negroes were hired then byLansing's big Oldsmobile plant, or the Reo plant. (Do you remember the Reo? It wasmanufactured in Lansing, and R. E. Olds, the man after whom it was named, also lived inLansing. When the war came along, they hired some Negro janitors.) The bulk of the Negroeswere either on Welfare, or W.P.A., or they starved. 
在我成长的时候，“成功的”兰辛黑人是这样的，比如服务员和擦鞋匠。在市中心的某个商店当清洁工是很受尊重的。真正的“精英”，“大人物”，“种族的声音”，是在兰辛乡村俱乐部的服务员和州议会的擦鞋男孩。唯一真正有钱的黑人是在数字赌博中赚了钱的人，或者是经营赌场的人，或者以某种方式靠着最贫穷的黑人(即大众)过活的人。那时没有兰辛的大型Oldsmobile工厂或Reo工厂雇佣黑人。(你还记得Reo吗？它在兰辛生产，R. E. Olds这个名字是以他的名字命名的制造商也住在兰辛。战争来临时，他们雇佣了一些黑人清洁工。)大多数黑人要么领取福利金，要么参加 W.P.A.项目，要么挨饿。
The day was to come when our family was so poor that we would eat the hole out of a doughnut;but at that time we were much better off than most town Negroes. The reason was that we raisedmuch of our own food out there in the country where we were. We were much better off than thetown Negroes who would shout, as my father preached, for the pie-in-the-sky and their heaven inthe hereafter while the white man had his here on earth. 
有一天，我们家变得非常贫困，以至于我们会把甜甜圈吃个精光；但在那个时候，我们比大多数镇上的黑人要好得多。原因是我们在乡下自己种了很多食物。我们比那些像我父亲一样喊着追求虚无缥缈的天堂和来世的城镇黑人要好得多，而他们却只关注着地上的白人。
I knew that the collections my father got for his preaching were mainly what fed and clothed us,and he also did other odd jobs, but still the image of him that made me proudest was hiscrusading and militant campaigning with thewords of Marcus Garvey. As young as  I was then, Iknew from what I overheard that my father was saying something that made him a "tough" man. Iremember an old lady, grinning and saying to my father, "You're scaring these white folks todeath!" 
我知道我父亲的布道所得主要用于供养和养活我们，他还做了一些零工，但让我最骄傲的形象是他以马库斯·加维(Marcus Garvey)的话语进行的游击和军事活动。那时我还很年轻，但从我听到的话中我知道我父亲说了一些让他成为“强硬派”的话。我记得一位老太太对我父亲笑着说：“你把这些白人都吓死了！”
One of the reasons I've always felt that my father favored me was that to the best of myremembrance, it was only me that he sometimes took with him to the Garvey U.N.I.A. meetingswhich he held quietly in different people's homes. There were never more than a few people atany one time-twenty at most. But that was a lot, packed into someone's living room. I noticed howdifferently they all acted, although sometimes they were the same people who jumped andshouted in church. But in these meetings both they and my father were more intense, moreintelligent and down to earth. It made me feel the same way. 
我一直觉得我父亲更偏爱我，其中一个原因是据我所记，只有我有时会和他一起去他举行的Garvey U.N.I.A.会议。这些会议是在不同人的家里悄悄举行的。每次最多不超过20人，但那已经是很多人了，挤在某个人的起居室里。我注意到他们在这些会议上表现得非常不同，尽管有时他们是在教堂里跳跃和高喊的人。但在这些会议上，他们和我的父亲都更加紧张、聪明和脚踏实地。这让我有同样的感觉。
I can remember hearing of "Adam driven out of the garden into the caves of Europe," "Africa forthe Africans," "Ethiopians, Awake!" And my father would talk about how it would not be muchlonger before Africa would be completely run by Negroes-"by black men," was the phrase healways used. 
我记得听到“亚当被赶出伊甸园，进入欧洲的洞穴”，“非洲属于非洲人”，“埃塞俄比亚人，醒来！”我父亲会谈论非洲很快就会被完全由黑人统治-他总是使用这个短语“由黑人”。
"No one knows when the hour of Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It is coming. Oneday, like a storm, it will be here." 
“没有人知道非洲救赎的时刻何时到来。它在风中飘荡，即将到来。有一天，就像一场风暴一样，它会来到这里。”
I remember seeing the big, shiny photographs of Marcus Garvey that were passed from hand tohand. My father had a big envelope of them that he always took to these meetings. The picturesshowed what seemed to me millions of Negroes thronged in parade behind Garvey riding in a finecar, a big black man dressed in a dazzling uniform with gold braid on it, and he was wearing athrilling hat with tall plumes. I remember hearing that he had black followers not only hi the UnitedStates but all around the world, and I remember how the meetings always closed with my fathersaying, several times, and the people chanting after him, "Up, you mighty race, you canaccomplish what you will!"I have never understood why, after hearing as much as I did of these kinds of things, I somehownever thought, then, of the black people in Africa. My image of Africa, at that time, was of nakedsavages, cannibals, monkeys and tigers and steaming jungles. 
我记得看到那些大而闪亮的马库斯·加维的照片，它们是手传手传递的。我父亲有一个装满这些照片的大信封，他总是带着它去参加这些会议。照片上似乎有数百万黑人跟在加维后面，骑着一辆漂亮的车，一个穿着华丽制服、金边熠熠生辉的大个子黑人，头上戴着一顶高耸的帽子。我记得他不仅在美国，而且在世界各地都有黑人追随者，我还记得每次会议结束时，我父亲会说几次，然后人们跟着他喊：“起来吧，你们强大的种族，你们可以实现你们的目标！”尽管我听到了很多这样的事情，但我不知道为什么，我从未想到过非洲的黑人。那时我对非洲的印象是裸露的野蛮人、食人族、猴子、老虎和蒸腾的丛林。
My father would drive in his old black touring car, sometimes taking me, to meeting places allaround the Lansing area. I remember one daytime meeting (most were at night) in the town ofOwosso, forty miles from Lansing, which the Negroes called "White City." (Owosso's greatestclaim to fame is that it is the home town of Thomas E. Dewey.) As in East Lansing, no Negroeswere allowed on the streets there after dark-hence the daytime meeting. In point of fact, in thosedays lots of Michigan towns were like that. Every town had a few "home" Negroes who livedthere. Sometimes it would be just one family, as in the nearby county seat, Mason, which had asingle Negro family named Lyons. Mr. Lyons had been a famous football star at Mason HighSchool, was highly thought of in Mason, and consequently he now worked around that town inmenial jobs. 
我父亲会开着他那辆旧的黑色旅行车，有时带着我去兰辛地区各地参加会议。我记得有一次白天在距离兰辛40英里的城镇奥沃索举行的会议(大多数会议都是晚上举行的),黑人称之为“白城”。 (奥沃索最大的名声是托马斯· E·杜威的家乡。)和东兰辛一样，晚上黑暗后不允许黑人在街上行走，因此举行了白天的会议。实际上，在那些日子里，许多密歇根小镇都是这样的。每个镇都有一些“本地”黑人住在那里。有时候只有一个家庭，比如附近的县府所在地梅森，那里有一个名叫莱昂斯的黑人家庭。莱昂斯先生曾是梅森高中著名的橄榄球明星，在梅森备受尊敬，因此他现在在该镇周围从事一些卑微的工作。
My mother at this tune seemed to be always working-cooking, washing, ironing, cleaning, andfussing over us eight children. And she was usually either arguing with or not speaking to myfather. One cause of friction was that she had strong ideas about what she wouldn't eat-and didn'twant _us_ to eat-including pork and rabbit, both of which my father loved dearly. 
在我小时候，我的母亲似乎总是忙着做家务，烹饪、洗衣、熨烫、打扫卫生，还要照顾我们这八个孩子。她通常要么和我父亲争吵，要么不和他说话。其中一个摩擦的原因是她对不吃的食物有着强烈的偏见-她不想让我们吃这些食物，包括父亲非常喜欢吃的猪肉和兔子肉。
He was a real Georgia Negro, and he believed in eating plenty of what we in Harlem today call"soul food." 
他是一个真正的乔治亚州黑人，他相信吃我们今天在哈莱姆所说的“灵魂食物”。
I've said that my mother was the one who whipped me-at least she did whenever she wasn'tashamed to let the neighbors think she was killing me. For if she even acted as though she wasabout to raise her hand to me, I would openmy mouth and let the world know about it. If anybodywas passing by out on the road, she would either change her mind or just give me a few licks. 
我说过，我的母亲才是那个打我的人-至少每当她不想让邻居们以为她在杀我时，她都会这样做。因为如果她甚至表现出要打我的意图，我会张嘴让全世界都知道。如果有人路过，她要么改变主意，要么只是给我几下。
Thinking about it now, I feel definitely that just as my father favored me for being lighter than theother children, my mother gave me more hell for the same reason. She was very light herself butshe favored the ones who were darker. Wilfred, I know, was particularly her angel. I rememberthat she would tell me to get out of the house and "Let the sun shine on you so you can get somecolor." She went out of her way never to let me become afflicted with a sense of color-superiority.I am sure that she treated me this way partly because of how she came to be light herself. 
现在回想起来，我绝对能感觉到，就像我父亲喜欢我比其他孩子轻一样，我母亲也因为我同样的原因而对我更严厉。她自己很轻盈，但却喜欢那些肤色较深的人。我知道威尔弗雷德对她来说是特别的天使。我记得她会让我出去晒太阳，“让阳光照耀你，让你变得更加美丽。”她总是设法不让我陷入一种优越感的境地。我相信她之所以这样对待我是有原因的，部分原因是她自己是如何变得轻盈的。
I learned early that crying out in protest could accomplish things. My older brothers and sister hadstarted to school when, sometimes, they would come in and ask for a buttered biscuit orsomething and my mother, impatiently, would tell them no. But I would cry out and make a fussuntil I got what I wanted. I remember well how my mother asked me why I couldn't be a nice boylike Wilfred; but I would think to myself that Wilfred, for being so nice and quiet, often stayedhungry. So early in life, I had learned that if you want something, you had better make somenoise. 
我从小就知道，大声抗议可以达到目的。我的哥哥姐姐们开始上学后，有时会回家要一块涂黄油的饼干或其他东西，而我母亲不耐烦地告诉他们不行。但我会哭闹，直到得到我想要的东西。我清楚地记得母亲问我为什么不能像威尔弗雷德那样做个好男孩；但我会想，因为如此善良和安静，威尔弗雷德经常会挨饿。所以在很早的时候，我就学会了如果你想要某样东西，最好制造一些噪音。
Not only did we have our big garden, but we raised chickens. My father would buy some babychicks and my mother would raise them. We all loved chicken. That was one dish there was noargument with my father about. One thing in particular that I remember made me feel gratefultoward my mother was that one day I went and asked her for my own garden, and she did let mehave my own little plot. I loved it and took care of it well. I loved especially to grow peas. I wasproud when we had them on our table. I would pull out the grass in my garden by hand when thefirst little blades came up. I would patrol the rows on my hands and knees for any worms andbugs, and I would kill and bury them. And sometimes when I had everything straight and clean formythings to grow, I would lie down on my back between two rows, and I would gaze up in theblue sky at the clouds moving and think all kinds of things. 
我们不仅有一个大花园，还养了鸡。我父亲会买一些小鸡苗，然后由我母亲来饲养它们。我们都很喜欢吃鸡肉。有一件事情让我对我的母亲感到特别感激，那就是我有一天去向她请求自己的花园，最终她同意给我一个小块地。我非常喜欢这个花园，并且照顾得很好。我特别喜欢种豌豆。当我们把它们放在餐桌上时，我会感到很自豪。当第一片嫩叶长出来的时候，我会用手拔掉花园里的草。我会用手膝爬行在行间寻找任何虫子和虫卵，并杀死并埋葬它们。有时候当我把一切都弄好了，干净整洁地等待着东西生长时，我会躺在两行之间仰望蓝天上的云朵移动，思考各种事情。
At five, I, too, began to go to school, leaving home in the morning along with Wilfred, Hilda, andPhilbert. It was the Pleasant Grove School that went from kindergarten through the eighth grade.It was two miles outside the city limits, and I guess there was no problem about our attendingbecause we were the only Negroes in the area. In those days white people in the North usuallywould "adopt" just a few Negroes; they didn't see them as any threat. The white kids didn't makeany great thing about us, either. They called us "nigger" and "darkie" and "Rastus" so much thatwe thought those were our natural names. But they didn't think of it as an insult; it was just theway they thought about us. 
五岁时，我也开始上学，每天早上和威尔弗雷德、希尔达和菲尔伯特一起离开家。我们去的是普莱森特格罗夫学校，从幼儿园到八年级都在那里上课。它位于城市外两英里的地方，我想我们能上学应该没问题，因为我们是该地区唯一的黑人。在那些日子里，北方的白人通常只会“收养”几个黑人；他们不把我们看作威胁。白人的孩子也对我们没有太多关注。他们经常用“黑鬼”、“黑奴”、“黑鬼”等称呼我们，以至于我们认为这些是我们的自然名字。但他们并没有把这当做一种侮辱，这只是我们被看待的方式。
*     *     * 
One afternoon in 1931 when Wilfred, Hilda, Philbert, and I came home, my mother and fatherwere having one of their arguments. There had lately been a lot of tension around the housebecause of Black Legion threats. Anyway, my father had taken one of the rabbits which we wereraising, and ordered my mother to cook it. We raised rabbits, but sold them to whites. My fatherhad taken a rabbit from the rabbit pen. He had pulled off the rabbit's head. He was so strong, heneeded no knife to behead chickens or rabbits. With one twist of his big black hands he simplytwisted off the head and threw the bleeding-necked thing back at my mother's feet. 
1931年的某个下午，威尔弗雷德、希尔达、菲尔伯特和我回到家时，我父母正在争吵。最近由于黑人军团的威胁，家里的气氛变得紧张。不管怎样，我父亲拿走了我们养的一只兔子，命令我母亲把它煮了。虽然我们养兔子，但还是把它们卖给了白人。我父亲从兔子笼子里抓了一只兔子。他扯掉了兔子的头。他很强壮，不需要刀就能砍下鸡或兔子的头。他用他那双又大又黑的手一扭就把兔子的头拧了下来，然后把流着血的脖子扔到我母亲脚边。
My mother was crying. She started to skin the rabbit, preparatory to cooking it. But my father wasso angry he slammed on out of the front door and started walking up the road toward town. 
我母亲当时在哭泣。她开始剥兔子的皮，准备烹饪它。但我父亲太生气了，他砰地一声关上门，开始向镇上走去。
  It was then that my mother had this vision. She had always been a strange woman in this sense,and had always had a strong intuition of things about to happen. And most of her children are thesame way, I think. When something is about to happen, I can feel something, sense something. Inever have known something to happen that has caught me completely off guard-except once.And that was when, years later, I discovered facts I couldn't believe about a man who, up untilthat discovery, I would gladly have given my life for. 
那时我母亲有了一个预感。她总是有一种奇怪的直觉，能够预知即将发生的事情。我想她的大多数孩子也是这样吧。当某些事情即将发生时，我能感觉到一些东西，察觉到一些事情。我从未经历过什么完全出乎意料的事情-除了那一次。那是几年后，我发现了一些关于一个男人的真相，让我无法相信。在发现这些真相之前，我会愿意为这个人献出生命。
My father was well up the road when my mother ran screaming out onto the porch. _"Early!Early!"_ She screamed his name. She clutched up her apron in one hand, and ran down acrossthe yard and into the road. My father turned around. He saw her. For some reason, consideringhow angry he had been when he left, he waved at her. But he kept on going. 
我父亲已经走到路的尽头，而我母亲却突然从门廊上尖叫着跑了出来。“快点！快点！”她大声喊着他的名字。她一只手攥紧了围裙，然后穿过院子跑向马路。我父亲转过身来，看到了她。不知道为什么，尽管他离开时非常生气，但看到她后，他还是朝她挥了挥手。但他继续往前走。
She told me later, my mother did, that she had a vision of my father's end. All the rest of theafternoon, she was not herself, crying and nervous and upset. She finished cooking the rabbitand put the whole thing in the warmer part of the black stove. When my father was not backhome by our bedtime, my mother hugged and clutched us, and we felt strange, not knowing whatto do, because she had never acted like that. 
她后来告诉我，我的母亲有预感我父亲的结局。整个下午，她都不正常，哭泣、紧张和不安。她把兔子煮好后放在黑色炉子的温暖部分里。当父亲在我们的睡觉时间之前还没有回家时，母亲拥抱我们，我们感到很奇怪，不知道该怎么做，因为她从来没有这样过。
I remember waking up to the sound of my mother's screaming again. When I scrambled out, Isaw the police in the Irving room; they were trying to calm her down. She had snatched on herclothes to go with them. And all of us children who were staring knew without anyone having tosay it that something terrible had happened to our father. 
我记得又一次被母亲的尖叫声吵醒。当我匆匆跑出去时，看到警察正在欧文的房间里；他们试图让她镇定下来。她已经穿好衣服准备跟着他们走。所有我们这些目瞪口呆的孩子都知道，没有任何人需要说出口，我们的父亲发生了可怕的事情。
My mother was taken by the police to the hospital, and to a room where a sheet was over myfather in a bed, and she wouldn't look, she was afraid to look. Probably it was wise that she didn't.My father's skull, on one side, was crushed in, I was told later. Negroes in Lansing have alwayswhispered that he wasattacked, and then laid across some tracks for a streetcar to run over him.His body was cut almost in half. 
我母亲被警察带到医院，到了一间房间里，一张床单盖在父亲身上。她不敢看，害怕看到。可能她不看是明智的。后来我得知，我的父亲的头骨一侧被压碎了。兰辛的黑人都曾私下里说，他遭到袭击后被放在一些轨道上，等待有轨电车碾过他的身体。他的尸体几乎被切成了两半。
He lived two and a half hours in that condition. Negroes then were stronger than they are now,especially Georgia Negroes. Negroes born in Georgia had to be strong simply to survive. 
他在那个状态下活了两个小时半。那时候的黑人比现在更强壮，尤其是乔治亚州的黑人。在乔治亚州出生的黑人必须强壮才能生存下去。
It was morning when we children at home got the word that he was dead. I was six. I canremember a vague commotion, the house filled up with people crying, saying bitterly that thewhite Black Legion had finally gotten him. My mother was hysterical. In the bedroom, womenwere holding smelling salts under her nose. She was still hysterical at the funeral. 
当我们这些在家的孩子得知他去世的消息时，已经是早上了。我当时六岁。我能记得一阵喧嚣声，房子里挤满了哭泣的人，痛苦地说白人黑人军团终于害死了他。我的母亲已经疯了。在卧室里，女人们拿着闻香剂放在她的鼻子下面。她在葬礼上仍然情绪失控。
I don't have a very clear memory of the funeral, either. Oddly, the main thing I remember is that itwasn't in a church, and that surprised me, since my father was a preacher, and I had been wherehe preached people's funerals in churches. But his was in a funeral home. 
我对葬礼的记忆也不是很清楚。奇怪的是，我唯一记得的是它不是在教堂举行的，这让我感到惊讶，因为我父亲是个牧师，我曾去过他在教堂里主持人们葬礼的地方。但他的葬礼是在殡仪馆举行的。
And I remember that during the service a big black fly came down and landed on my father's face,and Wilfred sprang up from his chair and he shooed the fly away, and he came groping back tohis chair-there were folding chairs for us to sit on-and the tears were streaming down his face.When we went by the casket, I remember that I thought that it looked as if my father's strongblack face had been dusted with flour, and I wished they hadn't put on such a lot of it. 
我还记得在葬礼上，一只大黑苍蝇飞下来停在了父亲的脸上。威尔弗雷德从椅子上跳了起来，赶走了苍蝇，然后摸索着回到了座位上-我们坐的是折叠椅-他的眼泪一直流个不停。当我们经过灵柩时，我记得我当时觉得父亲那张强壮的黑脸像是被面粉覆盖了一样，我真希望他们没有涂那么多粉。
Back in the big four-room house, there were many visitors for another week or so. They weregood friends of the family, such as the Lyons from Mason, twelve miles away, and the Walkers,McGuires, Liscoes, the Greens, Randolphs, and the Turners, and others from Lansing, and a lotof people from other towns, whom I had seen at the Garvey meetings. 
在那个有四个房间的大房子里，又有一周左右的时间有很多访客。他们都是这个家庭的好朋友，比如来自12英里外的梅森的利昂夫妇、沃克一家、麦奎尔一家、利索一家、格林一家、伦道夫一家和特纳一家，还有来自兰辛的其他人和我在加维会议上见过的其他城镇的人。
 We children adjusted more easily than our mother did. We couldn't see, as clearly as she did, thetrials that lay ahead. As the visitors tapered off, she became very concerned about collecting thetwo insurance policies that my father had always been proud he carried. He had always said thatfamilies should be protected in case of death. One policy apparently paid off without any problem- the smaller one. I don't know the amount of it. I would imagine it was not more than a thousanddollars, and maybe half of that. 
我们孩子们比母亲更容易适应。我们无法像她那样清楚地看到未来面临的考验。随着访客逐渐减少，她开始非常担心收集我父亲一直引以为豪的两份保险单。他总是说家庭应该在死亡时得到保护。其中一份保险似乎没有任何问题-较小的那份。我不知道它的金额。我猜想它不会超过一千美元，也许只有一半那么多。
But after that money came, and my mother had paid out a lot of it for the funeral and expenses,she began going into town and returning very upset. The company that had issued the biggerpolicy was balking at paying off. They were claiming that my father had committed suicide.Visitors came again, and there was bitter talk about white people: how could my father bashhimself in the head, then get down across the streetcar tracks to be run over? 
但在那笔钱到来之后，我的母亲已经花了很多钱用于葬礼和开销。她开始去城里，回来时非常沮丧。发行较大保单的公司拒绝支付赔偿金。他们声称我的父亲自杀了。访客再次来访，人们开始激烈地谈论白人：我父亲怎么会用头撞自己的头，然后走到有轨电车轨道上被碾过？
So there we were. My mother was thirty-four years old now, with no husband, no provider orprotector to take care of her eight children. But some kind of a family routine got going again. Andfor as long as the first insurance money lasted, we did all right. 
于是，我们就这样生活着。我母亲现在已经34岁了，没有丈夫，没有保护者来照顾她的八个孩子。但某种家庭常规又开始运作起来。只要第一笔保险金能够维持下去，我们就过得不错。
Wilfred, who was a pretty stable fellow, began to act older than his age. I think he had the senseto see, when the rest of us didn't, what was in the wind for us. He quietly quit school and went totown in search of work. He took any kind of job he could find and he would come home, dog-tired,in the evenings, and give whatever he had made to my mother. 
威尔弗雷德，一个相当稳重的人，开始表现出比他年龄更成熟的样子。我想他有预感，当其他人没有意识到时，我们将面临什么。他悄悄地辍学去城里找工作。他找到任何他能找到的工作，晚上回家疲惫不堪，然后把挣来的钱交给我的母亲。
Hilda, who always had been quiet, too, attended to the babies. Philbert and I didn't contributeanything. We just fought all the time-each other at home, and then at school we would team upand fight white kids. Sometimes the fights would be racial in nature, but they might be aboutanything. 
希尔达，她总是很安静，也负责照顾婴儿。菲尔伯特和我什么也没做。我们只是一直打架-在家里互相打，然后在学校里我们会联合起来和白人孩子打架。有时候打架是种族性质的，但它们可能是关于任何事情。
 Reginald came under my wing. Since he had grown out of the toddling stage, he and I hadbecome very close. I suppose I enjoyed the fact that he was the little one, under me, who lookedup to me. 
雷金纳德成了我的小跟班。自从他长大后不再蹒跚学步，他和我变得非常亲近。我想我喜欢这个事实，那就是他是我手下的小家伙，他仰慕我。
My mother began to buy on credit. My father had always been very strongly against credit. "Creditis the first step into debt and back into slavery," he had always said. And then she went to workherself. She would go into Lansing and find different jobs-in housework, or sewing-for whitepeople. They didn't realize, usually, that she was a Negro. A lot of white people around theredidn't want Negroes in their houses. 
我母亲开始赊账购物。我父亲一直强烈反对赊账。“赊账是走向债务和奴役的第一步，”他总是这样说。然后她开始自己工作。她会去兰辛找不同的工作-做家务或缝纫-为白人服务。通常他们不知道她是个黑人。那里的很多白人都不想让黑人进入他们的房屋。
She would do fine until in some way or other it got to people who she was, whose widow shewas. And then she would be let go. I remember how she used to come home crying, but trying tohide it, because she had lost a job that she needed so much. 
她会一直做得不错，直到某种方式涉及到了她的身份，她是一名寡妇。然后她就会被解雇。我记得她曾经回家哭泣，但试图掩饰，因为她失去了一个非常重要的工作。
Once when one of us-I cannot remember which-had to go for something to where she wasworking, and the people saw us, and realized she was actually a Negro, she was fired on thespot, and she came home crying, this time not hiding it. 
有一次，我们中的一个-我不记得是哪一个-需要去她工作的地方拿东西，人们看到我们是黑人后，当场就把她解雇了。这一次她没有掩饰自己的情绪，回家哭泣。
When the state Welfare people began coming to our house, we would come from schoolsometimes and find them talking with our mother, asking a thousand questions. They acted andlooked at her, and at us, and around in our house, in a way that had about it the feeling-at leastfor me-that we were not people. In their eyesight we were just _things_, that was all.My mother began to receive two checks-a Welfare check and, I believe, widow's pension. Thechecks helped. But they weren't enough, as many of us as there were. When they came, aboutthe first of the month, one always wasalready owed in full, if not more, to the man at the grocerystore. And, after that, the other one didn't last long. 
当州福利机构的人开始来我们家时，我们有时会从学校回家，发现他们在和母亲交谈，问了无数个问题。他们的行为和态度让我们感觉自己不像是人，至少对我来说是这样。在他们的眼中，我们只是一些物品，仅此而已。我母亲开始收到两张支票 - 一张福利支票和我相信的寡妇养老金。这些支票确实有帮助，但对于我们这么多人来说还不够。每当他们每月初来的时候，总是已经有人在杂货店欠下了很多钱，甚至更多。之后，另一张支票也撑不了多久。
We began to go swiftly downhill. The physical downhill wasn't as quick as the psychological. Mymother was, above everything else, a proud woman, and it took its toll on her that she wasaccepting charity. And her feelings were communicated to us. 
我们开始迅速地走下坡路。身体的下滑速度不如心理上的快。我母亲，尤其是其他方面，是一位自豪的女人，接受慈善对她来说是一种负担。她的情绪也传递给了我们。
She would speak sharply to the man at the grocery store for padding the bill, telling him that shewasn't ignorant, and he didn't like that. She would talk back sharply to the state Welfare people,telling them that she was a grown woman, able to raise her children, that it wasn't necessary forthem to keep coming around so much, meddling in our lives. And they didn't like that. 
她会对杂货店的那个人大声斥责，因为他多收了钱，告诉她自己不是无知的人，而他不喜欢这样。她也会对州福利机构的人大声回击，告诉他们自己是一个成年女性，有能力抚养孩子，不需要这么多人来干涉我们的生活，但他们不喜欢这样。
But the monthly Welfare check was their pass. They acted as if they owned us, as if we were theirprivate property. As much as my mother would have liked to, she couldn't keep them out. Shewould get particularly incensed when they began insisting upon drawing us older children aside,one at a time, out on the porch or somewhere, and asking us questions, or telling us things- against our mother and against each other. 
但每月的福利支票是他们的通行证。他们表现得好像我们是他们的私有财产一样。尽管我母亲很想把他们赶出去，但她做不到。当他们开始坚持要把我们年长的孩子叫到外面的门廊或其他地方，一个接一个地问问题或告诉我们事情时，她会特别生气，这违背了她和我们的意愿。
We couldn't understand why, if the state was willing to give us packages of meat, sacks ofpotatoes and fruit, and cans of all kinds of things, our mother obviously hated to accept. We reallycouldn't understand. What I later understood was that my mother was making a desperate effortto preserve her pride-and ours. 
我们不明白为什么，如果州政府愿意给我们一包肉、一袋土豆和水果，以及各种各样的罐头，但我的母亲显然不愿意接受。我们真的无法理解。后来我明白了，我母亲正在竭尽全力保护她的骄傲-还有我们的骄傲。
Pride was just about all we had to preserve, for by 1934, we really began to suffer. This wasabout the worst depression year, and no one we knew had enough to eat or live on. Some oldfamily friends visited us now and then. At first they brought food. Though it was charity, my mothertook it.Wilfred was working to help. My mother was working, when she could find any kind of job. InLansing, there was a bakery where, for a nickel, a couple of us children would buy a tall flour sackof day-old bread and cookies, and then walk the two miles back out into the country to our house.Our mother knew, I guess, dozens of ways to cook things with bread and out of bread. Stewedtomatoes with bread, maybe that would be a meal. Something like French toast, if we had anyeggs. Bread pudding, sometimes with raisins in it. If we got hold of some hamburger, it came tothe table more bread than meat. The cookies that were always in the sack with the bread, we justgobbled down straight. 
骄傲是我们唯一能保住的东西，因为到了1934年，我们真的开始遭受苦难。这是最糟糕的萧条年份，我们认识的人都没有足够的食物和生活必需品。一些旧家庭朋友偶尔会来看望我们。起初他们带来了食物。尽管是慈善，但我的母亲接受了。威尔弗雷德在努力帮助。我的母亲在找工作的时候也在工作。在兰辛市，有一家面包店，我们几个孩子可以用一毛钱买到一袋新鲜出炉的面包和饼干，然后走两英里的路回到农村的家。我猜我们的母亲知道用面包做几十种菜肴的方法。也许炒番茄配面包就是一顿饭。如果我们有鸡蛋的话，可以尝试类似法式吐司的食物。有时面包布丁里会加葡萄干。如果我们能找到汉堡包的话，桌子上会有比肉更多的面包。面包袋里总是有饼干，我们直接吃掉它们。
But there were times when there wasn't even a nickel and we would be so hungry we were dizzy.My mother would boil a big pot of dandelion greens, and we would eat that. I remember thatsome small-minded neighbor put it out, and children would tease us, that we ate "fried grass."Sometimes, if we were lucky, we would have oatmeal or cornmeal mush three times a day. Ormush in the morning and cornbread at night. 
但有时甚至没有一毛钱，我们会饿得头晕眼花。我母亲会煮一大锅蒲公英叶，我们就吃这个。我记得有些心胸狭窄的邻居把它扔出去，孩子们会取笑我们吃了“炒草”。有时，如果我们幸运的话，我们一天会有三次麦片粥或玉米糊。早上吃燕麦片，晚上吃玉米面包。
Philbert and I were grown up enough to quit fighting long enough to take the .22 caliber rifle thathad been our father's, and shoot rabbits that some white neighbors up or down the road wouldbuy. I know now that they just did it to help us, because they, like everyone, shot their ownrabbits. Sometimes, I remember, Philbert and I would take little Reginald along with us. He wasn'tvery strong, but he was always so proud to be along. We would trap muskrats out in the littlecreek in back of our house. And we would lie quiet until unsuspecting bullfrogs appeared, and wewould spear them, cut off their legs, and sell them for a nickel a pair to people who lived up anddown the road. The whites seemed less restricted in their dietary tastes. 
菲尔伯特和我长大了，不再打架了，我们拿起了父亲的.22口径步枪，去射击那些白人邻居们会买下来的兔子。现在我知道他们这么做是为了帮助我们，因为他们和其他人一样，也会猎杀自己的兔子。有时，我记得菲尔伯特和我会让小雷金纳德跟着我们一起去。他不是很强壮，但他总是很自豪地跟在我们身边。我们在后院的小溪里设陷阱捕捉麝鼠。然后我们静静地等待着不知情的牛蛙出现，用矛刺它们，砍掉它们的腿，然后以一毛钱一对的价格卖给住在路边的人。白人似乎在饮食上没有那么受限制。
Then, about in late 1934, I would guess, something began to happen. Some kind of psychologicaldeterioration hit our family circle and began to eat awayour pride. Perhaps it was the constanttangible evidence that we were destitute. We had known other families who had gone on relief.We had known without anyone in our home ever expressing it that we had felt prouder not to beat the depot where the free food was passed out. And, now, we were among them. At school, the"on relief" finger suddenly was pointed at us, too, and sometimes it was said aloud. 
大约在1934年末，我猜想一些事情开始发生了。某种心理上的堕落袭击了我们家庭圈子，并开始侵蚀我们的骄傲。也许是我们不断可见的贫困证据。我们知道其他家庭已经得到了救济。我们从未在家里的人表达过，但我们感到自豪，没有去抢分发免费食物的车站。现在，我们也在其中。在学校，“接受救济”的手指突然指向了我们，有时甚至大声说出来。
It seemed that everything to eat in our house was stamped Not To Be Sold. All Welfare food borethis stamp to keep the recipients from selling it. It's a wonder we didn't come to think of Not To BeSold as a brand name. 
似乎我们家里所有的食物都被贴上了“不得出售”的标签。所有的福利食品都带有这个标签，以防止接受者出售它们。真奇怪，我们没有想把“不得出售”当成一个品牌名。
Sometimes, instead of going home from school, I walked the two miles up the road into Lansing. Ibegan drifting from store to store, hanging around outside where things like apples weredisplayed in boxes and barrels and baskets, and I would watch my chance and steal me a treat.You know what a treat was to me? Anything! 
有时候，我不去学校回家，而是走上两英里的路到兰辛市。我开始在商店里闲逛，在外面观察像苹果这样的东西被放在箱子、桶和篮子里展示的地方，等待机会偷一点零食。你知道对我来说什么是奖励吗？任何东西！
Or I began to drop in about dinnertime at the home of some family that we knew. I knew that theyknew exactly why I was there, but they never embarrassed me by letting on. They would inviteme to stay for supper, and I would stuff myself. 
或者我开始在晚餐时间去我们认识的某个家庭家里。我知道他们知道我为什么在那里，但他们从不让我感到尴尬，也没有透露出来。他们会邀请我留下来吃晚饭，我会大吃特吃。
Especially, I liked to drop in and visit at the Gohannases' home. They were nice, older people,and great churchgoers. I had watched them lead the jum ping and shouting when my fatherpreached. They had, living with them-they were raising him-a nephew whom everyone called "BigBoy," and he and I got along fine. Also living with the Gohannases was old Mrs. Adcock, whowent with them to church. She was always trying to help anybody she could, visiting anyone sheheard was sick, carrying them something. She was the one who, years later, would tell mesomething that I remembered a long time: "Malcolm,there's one thing I like about you. You're nogood, but you don't try to hide it. You are not a hypocrite." 
特别是，我喜欢去拜访戈汉纳斯一家。他们是善良、年长的人，也是很好的教堂信徒。我看到他们在我父亲讲道时跳跃和欢呼。他们和他们一起生活-他们抚养他-一个大家都叫“大男孩”的侄子，他和我相处得很好。同时住在戈汉纳斯家的还有老阿德科克夫人，她和他们一起去教堂。她总是尽力帮助任何需要帮助的人，拜访任何听说生病的人，为他们带东西。多年后，她告诉我一件事情，我记得很久： “马尔科姆，我喜欢你的一点是，你不好，但你不会试图隐藏它。你不是一个伪善者。”
The more I began to stay away from home and visit people and steal from the stores, the moreaggressive I became in my inclinations. I never wanted to wait for anything. 
我越远离家，去拜访人们并从商店偷东西，我的倾向就越明显。我从来不想等待任何事情。
I was growing up fast, physically more so than mentally. As I began to be recognized morearound the town, I started to become aware of the peculiar attitude of white people toward me. Isensed that it had to do with my father. It was an adult version of what several white children hadsaid at school, in hints, or sometimes in the open, which really expressed what their parents hadsaid-that the Black Legion or the Klan had killed my father, and the insurance company hadpulled a fast one in refusing to pay my mother the policy money. 
我身体的成长很快，但心理上的成长却很慢。随着我在镇上越来越出名，我开始意识到白人对我的特殊态度。我感觉到这与我父亲有关。这是几个白人孩子在学校里以暗示或有时公开的方式表达的成人版本，他们真正表达了他们的父母所说的内容-黑军团或三K党杀了我的父亲，保险公司拒绝支付保险金给母亲。
When I began to get caught stealing now and then, the state Welfare people began to focus onme when they came to our house. I can't remember how I first became aware that they weretalking of taking me away. What I first remember along that line was my mother raising a stormabout being able to bring up her own children. She would whip me for stealing, and I would try toalarm the neighborhood with my yelling. One thing I have always been proud of is that I neverraised my hand against my mother. 
当我开始偶尔被抓到偷窃时，州福利机构的人开始在我们家集中关注我。我不记得我是如何第一次意识到他们要带走我。我第一个记得的是母亲为了养活自己的孩子而发脾气。她会打我因为偷东西，我会用尖叫声惊扰邻居。我一直为自己从未对母亲动手感到自豪。
In the summertime, at night, in addition to all the other things we did, some of us boys would slipout down the road, or across the pastures, and go "cooning" watermelons. White people alwaysassociated watermelons with Negroes, and they sometimes called Negroes "coons" among allthe other names, and so stealing watermelons became "cooning" them. If white boys were doingit, it implied that they were only acting like Negroes. Whites have always hidden or justified all ofthe guilts they could by ridiculing or blaming Negroes. 
在夏天的晚上，除了我们做的其他事情外，一些男孩会偷偷溜出路去，或者穿过牧场，去摘西瓜。白人总是把西瓜和黑人联系在一起，有时他们用“coons”这个词来称呼所有黑人，所以偷西瓜变成了“cooning”它们。如果白人男孩这样做，那意味着他们只是在模仿黑人。白人总是通过嘲笑或指责黑人来隐藏或合理化他们的罪恶感。
 One Halloween night, I remember that a bunch of us were out tipping over those old countryouthouses, and one old farmer-I guess he had tipped over enough in his day-had set a trap forus. Always, you sneak up from behind the outhouse, then you gang together and push it, to tip itover. This farmer had taken his outhouse off the hole, and set it just in _front_ of the hole. Well,we came sneaking up in single file, in the darkness, and the two white boys in the lead fell downinto the outhouse hole neck deep. They smelled so bad it was all we could stand to get them out,and that finished us all for that Halloween. I had just missed falling in myself. The whites were soused to taking the lead, this time it had really gotten them in the hole. 
有一个万圣节的晚上，我记得我们一群人正在推倒
Thus, in various ways, I learned various things. I picked strawberries, and though I can't recallwhat I got per crate for picking, I remember that after working hard all one day, I wound up withabout a dollar, which was a whole lot of money in those times. I was so hungry, I didn't know whatto do. I was walking away toward town with visions of buying something good to eat, and thisolder white boy I knew, Richard Dixon, came up and asked me if I wanted to match nickels. Hehad plenty of change for my dollar. In about a half hour, he had all the change back, including mydollar, and instead of going to town to buy something, I went home with nothing, and I was bitter.But that was nothing compared to what I felt when I found out later that he had cheated. There isa way that you can catch and hold the nickel and make it come up the way you want. This wasmy first lesson about gambling: if you see somebody winning all the time, he isn't gambling, he'scheating. Later on in life, if I were continuously losing in any gambling situation, I would watchvery closely. It's like the Negro in America seeing the white man win all the time. He's aprofessional gambler; he has all the cards and the odds stacked on his side, and he has alwaysdealt to our people from the bottom of the deck. 
通过各种方式，我学到了很多东西。我采摘草莓，虽然我不记得每盒采摘的草莓能得到多少钱，但我记得在一整天的努力工作后，我最终得到了大约一美元，这在当时是一笔不小的财富。我很饿，不知道该怎么办。我正朝着镇上走去，想着买些好吃的东西，这时一个我认识的老白人男孩理查德·迪克森走过来问我是否想玩硬币游戏。他有很多零钱可以换我的一美元。大约半个小时后，他把所有的零钱都还给我，包括我的一美元，而不是去镇上买东西，我回家什么都没有，感到很生气。但这与我后来发现他欺骗了我相比，根本不算什么。有一种方法可以抓住并拿住硬币，让它按照你想要的方式出现。这是我关于赌博的第一个教训：如果你看到某个人总是赢，他不是在赌博，他在作弊。以后如果我在任何赌博场合中一直输钱，我会非常仔细地观察。就像在美国的黑人看到白人总是赢一样。他是职业赌徒；他有所有的牌和优势在他这边，而且他总是从我们的手中抽到最底下的牌。
About this time, my mother began to be visited by some Seventh Day Adventists who had movedinto a house not too far down the road from us. Theywould talk to her for hours at a time, andleave booklets and leaflets and magazines for her to read. She read them, and Wilfred, who hadstarted back to school after we had begun to get the relief food supplies, also read a lot. His headwas forever in some book. 
大约在这个时候，我的母亲开始被一些第七日基督复临派的教徒访问。他们搬到了离我们不远的房子里。他们会和她交谈几个小时，并留下小册子、传单和杂志供她阅读。她读了它们，威尔弗雷德在我们开始获得救济食品供应后回到学校，也读了很多书。他的头永远在某本书中。
Before long, my mother spent much time with the Adventists. It's my belief that what mostlyinfluenced her was that they had even more diet restrictions than she always had taught andpracticed with us. Like us, they were against eating rabbit and pork; they followed the Mosaicdietary laws. They ate nothing of the flesh without a split hoof, or that didn't chew a cud. Webegan to go with my mother to the Adventist meetings that were held further out in the country.For us children, I know that the major attraction was the good food they served. But we listened,too. There were a handful of Negroes, from small towns in the area, but I would say that it wasninety-nine percent white people. The Adventists felt that we were living at the end of time, thatthe world soon was coming to an end. But they were the friendliest white people I had ever seen.In some ways, though, we children noticed, and, when we were back at home, discussed, thatthey were different from us-such as the lack of enough seasoning in their food, and the differentway that white people smelled. 
不久之后，我的母亲花了很多时间与基督复临派的教徒在一起。我相信对她影响最大的是，他们对饮食的限制比我们一直教导和实践的还要多。像我们一样，他们反对吃兔子和猪肉；他们遵循摩西饮食法典。他们不吃没有蹄骨的肉，或不咀嚼乳制品。威尔弗雷德开始和我的母亲一起去更远的国家举行的基督复临派聚会。对我们这些孩子来说，我知道主要的吸引力是他们提供的良好食物。但我们也听从了他们的话。那里有一些来自该地区小镇的黑人，但我想说的是，其中99%是白人。基督复临派认为我们生活在末日即将到来的时代，世界很快就会结束。但他们是我在生活中见过的最友好的白人。然而，在某些方面，我们这些孩子注意到了，当我们回到家里时，我们讨论过，他们与我们不同-比如他们的食物缺乏足够的调味料，以及他们的气味与我们不同。
*     *     * 
Meanwhile, the state Welfare people kept after my mother. By now, she didn't make it any secretthat she hated them, and didn't want them in her house. But they exerted their right to come, andI have many, many times reflected upon how, talking to us children, they began to plant the seedsof division in our minds. They would ask such things as who was smarter than the other. And theywould ask me why I was "so different." 
与此同时，州福利机构的人继续追问我的母亲。现在，她已经不再对他们保持秘密，她讨厌他们，也不想让他们进入她的家。但是他们行使了权利来到我们这里，我反复思考过很多次，当他们和我们这些孩子交谈时，他们是如何开始在我们心中种下分裂的种子的。他们会问一些问题，比如谁比另一个更聪明。他们还会问我为什么我“如此不同”。
  I think they felt that getting children into foster homes was a legitimate pan of their function, andthe result would be less troublesome, however they went about it. 
我认为他们觉得把孩子送到寄养家庭是他们职责的合理一部分，无论他们如何做，结果都会更少麻烦。
And when my mother fought them, they went after her-first, through me. I was the first target. Istole; that implied that I wasn't being taken care of by my mother. 
当我的母亲与他们作斗争时，他们开始找我麻烦。我是第一个目标。偷窃意味着我没有得到母亲的照顾。
All of us were mischievous at some time or another, I more so than any of the rest. Philbert and Ikept a battle going. And this was just o ne of a dozen things that kept building up the pressure onmy mother. 
我们所有人在某个时候或某个时刻都会调皮，我比其他人都调皮。菲尔伯特和艾克经常打架。这只是我们母亲面临的压力不断增加的众多事情之一。
I'm not sure just how or when the idea was first dropped by the Welfare workers that our motherwas losing her mind. 
我不确定福利工作者何时或如何首次提出我们母亲正在失去理智的想法。
But I can distinctly remember hearing "crazy" applied to her by them when they learned that theNegro fanner who was in the next house down the road from us had offered to give us somebutchered pork-a whole pig, maybe even two of them-and she had refused. We all heard themcall my mother "crazy" to her face for refusing good meat. It meant nothing to them even whenshe explained that we had never eaten pork, that it was against her religion as a Seventh DayAdventist. 
但我清楚地记得，当他们得知住在我们家附近公路下一家房子里的黑人农民愿意给我们一些屠宰的猪肉(一整只猪，甚至可能是两只)时，他们称她“疯了”。她拒绝了。我们都听到他们在她面前称她为“疯子”，因为她拒绝了好肉。即使她解释说我们从未吃过猪肉，因为这是她的宗教信仰——第七日基督复临派所禁止的，对他们来说也没有任何意义。
They were as vicious as vultures. They had no feelings, understanding, compassion, or respectfor my mother. They told us, "She's crazy for refusing food." Right then was when our home, ourunity, began to disintegrate. We were having a hard time, and I wasn't helping. But we could havemade it, we could have stayed together. As bad as I was, as much trouble and worry as I causedmy mother, I loved her. 
他们就像秃鹰一样残忍。他们没有感情、理解、同情或尊重我的母亲。他们告诉我们：“她拒绝食物是疯了。”那时，我们的家庭和团结开始瓦解。我们很难过，而我也没有帮助。但我们本可以坚持下去，保持团结。尽管我不好，给我母亲带来了很多麻烦和担忧，但我爱她。
The state people, we found out, had interviewed the Gohannas family, andthe Gohannases hadsaid that they would take me into their home. My mother threw a fit, though, when she heard that- and the home wreckers took cover for a while. 
我们发现，州政府的人已经采访了Gohannas一家，他们说要把我送到他们家去。但当我的母亲听到这个消息时，她大发脾气-于是那些破坏家庭的人暂时躲起来了。
It was about this time that the large, dark man from Lansing began visiting. I don't remember howor where he and my mother met. It may have been through some mutual friends. I don'tremember what the man's profession was. In 1935, in Lansing, Negroes didn't have anything youcould call a profession. But the man, big and black, looked something like my father. I canremember his name, but there's no need to mention it. He was a single man, and my mother wasa widow only thirty-six years old. The man was independent; naturally she admired that. She washaving a hard time disciplining us, and a big man's presence alone would help. And if she had aman to provide, it would send the state people away forever. 
大约在这个时候，来自Lansing的大个子黑人开始来访。我不记得他和我母亲是如何相遇的，可能是通过一些共同的朋友认识的。我不记得这个男人的职业是什么。在1935年，在Lansing,黑人没有什么可以被称为职业的东西。但是这个大个子黑人看起来很像我的父亲。我可以记得他的名字，但没有必要提到它。他是一个单身男人，而我的母亲只有36岁就成为了寡妇。这个男人很独立，她自然会欣赏这一点。她在管教我们方面遇到了困难，一个大男人的存在本身就会有所帮助。如果她有一个男人来提供帮助，这将永远把州政府的人赶走。
We all understood without ever saying much about it. Or at least we had no objection. We took itin stride, even with some amusement among us, that when the man came, our mother would beall dressed up in the best that she had-she still was a good-looking woman-and she would actdifferently, light-hearted and laughing, as we hadn't seen her act in years. 
我们都心照不宣，没有多说什么。或者至少我们没有反对。我们从容应对，甚至有些幽默感，当这个男人来的时候，我的母亲会穿上她最好的衣服-她仍然是一个漂亮的女人-她会表现得不同，轻松愉快地笑着，就像我们多年没有看到她那样了。
It went on for about a year, I guess. And then, about 1936, or 1937, the man from Lansing jiltedmy mother suddenly. He just stopped coming to see her. From what I later understood, he finallybacked away from taking on the responsibility of those eight mouths to feed. He was afraid of somany of us. To this day, I can see the trap that Mother was in, saddled with all of us. And I canalso understand why he would shun taking on such a tremendous responsibility. 
我想大约持续了一年左右，然后在1936年或1937年，来自Lansing的男人突然抛弃了我的母亲。他突然停止来看她。从我后来的理解中，他最终放弃了照顾我们这八个月的责任。他害怕我们中的太多人。直到现在，我仍然可以看到母亲所处的陷阱，背负着我们所有人的重担。我也能够理解为什么他会回避承担如此巨大的责任。
But it was a terrible shock to her. It was the beginning of the end of reality for my mother. Whenshe began to sit around and walk around talking to herself-almost as though she was unawarethat we were there-it became increasingly terrifying. 
但这对她来说是一个巨大的打击。这是我母亲现实的终结。当她开始坐在那里走来走去，自言自语，仿佛她不知道我们在那里一样，这变得越来越可怕。
The state people saw her weakening. That was when they began the definite steps to take meaway from home. They began to tell me how nice it was going to be at the Gohannases' home,where the Gohannases and Big Boy and Mrs. Adcock had all said how much they liked me, andwould like to have me live with them. 
州政府的人看到她变得越来越虚弱。那时他们开始采取明确的步骤，要把我从家里带走。他们开始告诉我，在Gohannas家会过得很好，在那里Gohannas、Big Boy和Adcock夫人都说过他们很喜欢我，愿意让我和他们住在一起。
I liked all of them, too. But I didn't want to leave Wilfred. I looked up to and admired my bigbrother. I didn't want to leave Hilda, who was like my second mother. Or Philbert; even in ourfighting, there was a feeling of brotherly union. Or Reginald, especially, who was weak with hishernia condition, and who looked up to me as his big brother who looked out for him, as I lookedup to Wilfred. And I had nothing, either, against the babies, Yvonne, Wesley, and Robert. 
我也喜欢他们所有人。但我不想离开Wilfred。我尊敬并仰慕我的大哥哥。我不想离开Hilda,她就像我的第二个母亲一样。或者Philbert,即使在我们打架的时候，也有一种兄弟团结的感觉。尤其是Reginald,他因疝气而虚弱，他把我看作是他的大哥哥，会照顾他，就像我仰慕Wilfred一样。我也不反对婴儿Yvonne、Wesley和Robert。
As my mother talked to herself more and more, she gradually became less responsive to us. Andless responsible. The house became less tidy. We began to be more unkempt. And usually, now,Hilda cooked. 
随着我母亲自言自语越来越多，她逐渐对我们变得不那么有反应，也不再那么负责任。房子也变得越来越不整洁，我们也开始变得越来越不整洁。通常现在是Hilda做饭。
We children watched our anchor giving way. It was something terrible that you couldn't get yourhands on, yet you couldn't get away from. It was a sensing that something bad was going tohappen. We younger ones leaned more and more heavily on the relative strength of Wilfred andHilda, who were the oldest. 
我们这些孩子看着我们的家长逐渐垮台。这是一些你无法掌控但又无法逃脱的事情。这是一种感觉，即将发生一些不好的事情。我们这些年轻人越来越依赖年龄最大的Wilfred和Hilda的力量。
When finally I was sent to the Gohannases' home, at least in a surface way I was glad. Iremember that when I left home with the state man, my mother said one thing: "Don't let themfeed him any pig." 
当我最终被送到Gohannas家时，至少在表面上我很高兴。我记得当我和州政府的人离开家时，我母亲说了一句话：“不要让他们给他喂猪”。
It was better, in a lot of ways, at the Gohannases'. Big Boy and I shared his roomtogether, and wehit it off nicely. He just wasn't the same as my blood brothers. The Gohannases were veryreligious people. Big Boy and I attended church with them. They were sanctified Holy Rollersnow. The preachers and congregations jum ped even higher and shouted even louder than theBaptists I had known. They sang at the top of their lungs, and swayed back and forth and criedand moaned and beat on tambourines and chanted. It was spooky, with ghosts and spirituals and"ha'nts" seeming to be in the very atmosphere when finally we all came out of the church, goingback home. 
在Gohannas家，从很多方面来说都更好。我和Big Boy共用他的房间，我们相处得很好。他只是和我那些亲兄弟不太一样。Gohannases一家非常虔诚的教徒。Big Boy和我在教堂里参加他们的礼拜。他们现在已经成为了神圣的摩门教徒。牧师和会众跳得更高、喊得更响，比我所认识的浸信会教徒还要高亢。他们大声地唱着，左右摇摆着，哭泣、呻吟、敲打着手鼓，并不停地唱着赞美诗。当我们最终走出教堂回家时，空气中似乎弥漫着鬼魂、灵性和“哈特”(一种美国南部黑人音乐)的气息，这让人感到有些毛骨悚然。
The Gohannases and Mrs. Adcock loved to go fishing, and some Saturdays Big Boy and I wouldgo along. I had changed schools now, to Lansing's West Junior High School. It was right in theheart of the Negro community, and a few white kids were there, but Big Boy didn't mix much withany of our schoolmates, and I didn't either. And when we went fishing, neither he nor I liked theidea of just sitting and waiting for the fish to jerk the cork under the water-or make the tight linequiver, when we fished that way. I figured there should be some smarter way to get the fish- though we never discovered what it might be. 
Gohannas和Adcock夫人喜欢去钓鱼，一些星期六Big Boy和我也会一起去。我现在已经转到Lansing的West Junior High学校上学了。它位于黑人社区的中心地带，有一些白人孩子在那里，但Big Boy并不与我们的许多同学混在一起，我也一样。当我们去钓鱼时，他和我都不认为仅仅坐着等待鱼咬住鱼钩或拉紧钓线是明智的做法。我认为应该有更聪明的方法来捕鱼-尽管我们从未发现它是什么。
Mr. Gohannas was close cronies with some other men who, some Saturdays, would take me andBig Boy with them hunting rabbits. I had my father's .22 caliber rifle; my mother had said it was allright for me to take it with me. The old men had a set rabbit-hunting strategy that they had alwaysused. Usually when a dog jumps a rabbit, and the rabbit gets away, that rabbit will alwayssomehow instinctively run in a circle and return sooner or later past the very spot where heoriginally was jumped. Well, the old men would just sit and wait in hiding somewhere for the rabbitto come back, then get their shots at him. I got to thinking about it, and finally I thought of a plan. Iwould separate from them and Big Boy and I would go to a point where I figured that the rabbit,returning, would have to pass me first. 
Gohannas先生和其他一些人是密友，他们有时会带着我和Big Boy去打兔子。我有父亲的.22口径步枪，母亲说我可以带它一起出去。那些老人有一个打兔子的固定策略，他们总是这样使用。通常当一只狗跳过一只兔子，兔子逃脱时，那只兔子总是本能地跑成一个圈，并最终回到最初跳的地方附近。老人就会躲在某个地方等待兔子回来，然后向它开枪。我开始思考这个问题，最后想出了一个计划。我会和Big Boy分开行动，我们会去一个我认为兔子回来必须经过的地方。
  It worked like magic. I began to get three and four rabbits before they got one. The astonishingthing was that none of the old men ever figured out why. They outdid themselves exclaiming whata sure shot I was. I was about twelve, then. All I had done was to improve on their strategy, and itwas the beginning of a very important lesson in life-that anytime you find someone moresuccessful than you are, especially when you're both engaged in the same business-you knowthey're doing something that you aren't. 
这就像魔法一样有效。我开始比他们先抓到三、四只兔子。令人惊讶的是，那些老人从未弄清楚原因。他们惊叹于我的准确射击，但实际上我只是改进了他们的策略。当时我大约十二岁。我所做的只是在生活中学到了一个非常重要的教训-当你发现有人比你更成功时，尤其是在你从事同一行业时，你知道他们在做一些你没有做的事情。
I would return home to visit fairly often. Sometimes Big Boy and one or another, or both, of theGohannases would go with me-sometimes not. I would be glad when some of them did go,because it made the ordeal easier. 
我会经常回家拜访。有时Big Boy或其他Gohannases中的一个或两个人会和我一起去，有时不会。如果他们中有几个跟我一起去，我会很高兴，因为这使这个过程更容易一些。
Soon the state people were making plans to take over all of my mother's children. She talked toherself nearly all of the time now, and there was a crowd of new white people entering the picture- always asking questions. They would even visit me at the Gohannases'. They would ask mequestions out on the porch, or sitting out in their cars. 
很快，州政府的人开始制定接管我母亲所有孩子的计划。现在她几乎总是自言自语，而且出现了一群新来的白人-他们总是问问题。他们甚至会来Gohannases家拜访我。他们在门廊上或坐在车里问我问题。
Eventually my mother suffered a complete breakdown, and the court orders were finally signed.They took her to the State Mental Hospital at Kalamazoo. 
最终我母亲彻底崩溃了，法院终于签署了命令。他们将她送到Kalamazoo州立精神病医院。
It was seventy-some miles from Lansing, about an hour and a half on the bus. A Judge McClellanin Lansing had authority over me and all of my brothers and sisters. We were "state children,"court wards; he had the full say-so over us. A white man in charge of a black man's children!Nothing but legal, modern slavery-however kindly intentioned. 
它距离Lansing大约70英里，乘公共汽车需要一个半小时。一位名叫McClellanin Lansing的法官在法律上拥有对我和我所有的兄弟姐妹的管辖权。我们是“州儿童”，法院监护人；他对我们的决定有最终决定权。一个白人掌控着黑人的孩子们！除了合法的现代奴隶制-无论如何都是出于善意。
*     *     * 
My mother remained in the same hospital at Kalamazoo for about twenty-sixyears. Later, when Iwas still growing up in Michigan, I would go to visit her every so often. Nothing that I can imaginecould have moved me as deeply as seeing her pitiful state. In 1963, we got my mother out of thehospital, and she now lives there in Lansing with Philbert and his family. 
我的母亲在Kalamazoo的州立精神病医院住了大约26年。后来，当我还在密歇根州长大的时候，我会偶尔去看望她。没有什么能像看到她可怜的样子那样深深地打动我。1963年，我们把母亲从医院接了出来，现在她和Philbert及其家人一起住在Lansing。
It was so much worse than if it had been a physical sickness, for which a cause might be known,medicine given, a cure effected. Every time I visited her, when finally they led her-a case, anumber-back inside from where we had been sitting together, I felt worse. 
这比身体上的疾病还要糟糕，因为病因可能已知，可以给予药物治疗，实现治愈。每次我去看她时，当最后他们带她-一个案例，一个数字-回到我们一起坐的地方时，我感觉更糟了。
My last visit, when I knew I would never come to see her again-there-was in 1952. I was twenty- seven. My brother Philbert had told me that on his last visit, she had recognized him somewhat."In spots," he said. 
我最后一次去看她时，我知道我再也不会来看她了-那是在1952年。那时我27岁。我的兄弟Philbert告诉我，在他最后一次去看望她时，她有点认出了他。“有几个地方，”他说。
But she didn't recognize me at all. 
但是她完全没有认出我来。
She stared at me. She didn't know who I was. 
她盯着我看，完全不知道我是谁。
Her mind, when I tried to talk, to reach her, was somewhere else. I asked, "Mama, do you knowwhat day it is?" 
当我试图与她交谈，接近她时，她的思维却在别处。我问：“妈妈，你知道今天是什么日子吗？”
She said, staring, "All the people have gone." 
她盯着我说：“所有的人都已经走了。”
I can't describe how I felt. The woman who had brought me into the world, and nursed me, andadvised me, and chastised me, and loved me, didn't know me. It was as if I was trying to walk upthe side of a hill of feathers. I looked at her. I listened to her "talk." But there was nothing I coulddo. 
我无法描述我的感觉。那个把我带到这个世界，抚养我，给我建议，责备我，爱我的人竟然不认识我。这就像我在试图爬上一堆羽毛的山丘。我看着她，听着她的“谈话”，但我无能为力。
I truly believe that if ever a state social agency destroyed a family, it destroyed ours. We wantedand tried to stay together. Our home didn't have to be destroyed. But the Welfare, the courts, andtheir doctor, gave us theone-two-three punch. And ours was not the only case of this kind. 
我真心相信，如果有任何一个州社会机构摧毁了一个家庭，那就摧毁了我们的家庭。我们希望并尝试着保持在一起。我们的家不必被摧毁。但是福利、法院和他们的医生给了我们一、二、三拳。我们的案例并不是唯一的例子。
I knew I wouldn't be back to see my mother again because it could make me a very vicious anddangerous person-knowing how they had looked at us as numbers and as a case in their book,not as human beings. And knowing that my mother in there was a statistic that didn't have to be,that existed because of a society's failure, hypocrisy, greed, and lack of mercy and compassion.Hence I have no mercy or compassion in me for a society that will crush people, and thenpenalize them for not being able to stand up under the weight. 
我知道我再也不会回到母亲身边，因为知道他们把我们看作数字和案例，而不是人，这会让我成为一个非常凶恶和危险的人。而我的妈妈在里面只是一个统计数据，本不需要这样存在，是因为社会的失败、虚伪、贪婪以及缺乏怜悯和同情。因此，我对这个会摧毁人们的社会没有半点怜悯和同情，只会惩罚那些无法承受压力的人们。
I have rarely talked to anyone about my mother, for I believe that I am capable of killing a person,without hesitation, who happened to make the wrong kind of remark about my mother. So Ipurposely don't make any opening for some fool to step into. 
我很少跟别人谈论我的母亲，因为我相信我可以毫不犹豫地杀死任何对母亲说错话的人。因此，我会故意不给任何人留下机会来冒犯我。
Back then when our family was destroyed, in 1937, Wilfred and Hilda were old enough so that thestate let them stay on their own in the big four-room house that my father had built. Philbert wasplaced with another family in Lansing, a Mrs. Hackett, while Reginald and Wesley went to livewith a family called Williams, who were friends of my mother's. And Yvonne and Robert went tolive with a West Indian family named McGuire. 
当时在1937年，当我们的家人被摧毁时，Wilfred和Hilda已经长大了，所以政府让他们留在父亲建造的四间大房子里自己住。Philbert被安排住在Lansing的另一个家庭中，与一位名叫Hackett的女士一起生活，而Reginald和Wesley则与我母亲的朋友一家Williams生活在一起。Yvonne和Robert则与一个名为McGuire的西印度家庭一起生活。
Separated though we were, all of us maintained fairly close touch around Lansing-in school andout-whenever we could get together. Despite the artificially created separation and distancebetween us, we still remained very close in our feelings toward each other. 
尽管我们被分开，但我们在Lansing周围保持着相当紧密的联系-在学校和外出时。尽管人为地制造了我们的分离和距离，但在感情上我们仍然非常亲密。
CHAPTER TWO 
第二章
MASCOTOn June twenty-seventh of that year, nineteen thirty-seven, Joe Louis knocked out James J.Braddock to become the heavyweight champion of the world. And all the Negroes in Lansing, likeNegroes everywhere, went wildly happy with the greatest celebration of race pride our generationhad ever known. Every Negro boy old enough to walk wanted to be the next Brown Bomber. Mybrother Philbert, who had already become a pretty good boxer in school, was no exception. (I wastrying to play basketball. I was gangling and tall, but I wasn't very good at it-too awkward.) In thefall of that year, Philbert entered the amateur bouts that were held in Lansing's PruddenAuditorium. 
1937年6月27日，乔·路易斯在一场比赛中击败詹姆斯·J·布拉多克，成为了世界重量级冠军。所有在兰辛的黑人，像世界各地的黑人一样，都疯狂地庆祝我们这一代人所知道的最伟大的种族自豪感。每个足够走路的黑人男孩都想成为下一个布朗轰炸机。我的兄弟菲尔伯特已经在学校里成为了一名相当不错的拳击手，也不例外。(我当时正在尝试打篮球。我又高又瘦，但我不太擅长——太尴尬了。)在那年的秋天，菲尔伯特进入了兰辛普鲁登斯礼堂举行的业余比赛。
He did well, surviving the increasingly tough eliminations. I would go down to the gym and watchhim train. It was very exciting. Perhaps without realizing it I became secretly envious; for onething, I know I could not help seeing some of my younger brother Reginald's lifelong admirationfor me getting siphoned off to Philbert. 
他表现得很好，成功地度过了越来越艰难的淘汰赛。我会去体育馆看他训练。这非常令人兴奋。也许在不知不觉中，我变得暗自嫉妒；因为一件事，我知道我无法避免看到一些我弟弟雷金纳德对我终生的钦佩被转移到菲尔伯特身上。
People praised Philbert as a natural boxer. I figured that since we belonged to the same family,maybe I would become one, too. So I put myself in the ring. I think I was thirteen when I signedup for my first bout, but my height and rawboned frame let me get away with claiming that I wassixteen, the minimum age-and my weight of about 128 pounds got me classified as abantamweight. 
人们称赞菲尔伯特是一名天生的拳击手。我猜想，既然我们属于同一个家族，也许我也能成为其中一员。于是，我进入了拳击场。我想我13岁的时候报名参加了第一场比赛，但我的身高和瘦弱的身体让我声称自己是16岁，这是最低年龄——而我的体重约为128磅，被归类为轻量级。
They matched me with a white boy, a novice like myself, named Bill Peterson. I'll never forgethim. When our turn in the next amateur bouts came up, all of my brothers and sisters were 24there watching, along with just about everyone else I knew in town. They were there not so muchbecause of me but because of Philbert, who had begun to build up a pretty good following, andthey wanted to see how his brother would do. 
他们把我和一个和我一样是新手的白人男孩，名叫比尔·皮特森匹配在一起。我永远不会忘记他。当我们在下一场比赛中的回合到来时，我的兄弟姐妹们和其他镇上几乎所有的人都在那里观看，有24个。他们不是因为我看比赛，而是因为菲尔伯特，他已经开始建立起相当不错的追随者群体，他们想看看他的哥哥会怎么做。
  I walked down the aisle between the people thronging the rows of seats, and climbed in the ring.Bill Peterson and I were introduced, and then the referee called us together and mumbled all ofthat stuff about fighting fair and breaking clean. Then the bell rang and we came out of ourcorners. I knew I was scared, but I didn't know, as Bill Peterson told me later on, that he wasscared of me, too. He was so scared I was going to hurt him that he knocked me down fifty timesif he did once. 
我穿过挤满了人行的座位，走上了比赛场地。比尔·皮特森和我被介绍了一下，然后裁判叫我们走到一起，咕哝着那些关于公平竞争和干净利落打架的话。然后铃声响起，我们走出了自己的角落。我知道我很害怕，但后来比尔·彼得森告诉我，他也很害怕我。他太害怕我会伤害到他了，以至于如果我打了他一次，他就把我击倒50次。
He did such a job on my reputation in the Negro neighborhood that I practically went into hiding. ANegro just can't be whipped by somebody white and return with his head up to the neighborhood,especially in those days, when sports and, to a lesser extent show business, were the only fieldsopen to Negroes, and when the ring was the only place a Negro could whip a white man and notbe lynched. When I did show my face again, the Negroes I knew rode me so badly I knew I had todo something. 
他在黑人社区中毁了我的名声，以至于我几乎躲起来了。一个黑人不能被白人打败并带着头回到社区，尤其是在那些日子里，体育和(较小程度上)演艺界是唯一向黑人开放的领域，而拳击场是黑人唯一可以打败白人而不被私刑处死的地方。当我再次露面时，我知道我必须做点什么。
But the worst of my humiliations was my younger brother Reginald's attitude: he simply nevermentioned the fight. It was the way he looked at me-and avoided looking at me. So I went back tothe gym, and I trained-hard. I beat bags and skipped rope and grunted and sweated all over theplace. And finally I signed up to fight Bill Peterson again. This time, the bouts were held in hishometown of Alma, Michigan. 
但我最尴尬的事情是我的弟弟雷金纳德的态度：他从未提到那场比赛。这是他看我的方式——避免看着我。所以我回到拳击馆，努力训练。我打沙袋、跳绳、喘气和流汗。最终，我再次报名与比尔·皮特森比赛。这次，比赛在他在密歇根州的家乡阿尔玛举行。
The only thing better about the rematch was that hardly anyone I knew was there to see it; I wasparticularly grateful for Reginald's absence. The moment the bell rang, I saw a fist, then thecanvas coming up, and ten seconds later the referee was saying "Ten!" over me. It was probablythe shortest "fight" in history. I lay there listening to the full count, but I couldn't move. To tell thetruth, I'm not sure I wanted to move. 
再次比赛唯一好的事情是，几乎没有人知道我在那里看；我特别感谢雷金纳德的缺席。当铃声响起时，我看到了拳头，然后是拳击袋弹起，十秒钟后裁判在我耳边喊“十！”这可能是历史上最短的“战斗”。我躺在那里听着完整的计数，但我无法动弹。说实话，我不确定我想动。
That white boy was the beginning and the end of my fight career. A lot oftunes in these later yearssince I became a Muslim, I've thought back to that fight and reflected that it was Allah's work tostop me: I might have wound up punchy. 
那个白人男孩是我拳击生涯的开始和结束。在后来的岁月里，当我成为一名穆斯林时，我回想起那场比赛，反思这是真主阻止了我：我可能会变得粗暴。
Not long after this, I came into a classroom with my hat on. I did it deliberately. The teacher, whowas white, ordered me to keep the hat on, and to walk around and around the room until he toldme to stop. "That way," he said, "everyone can see you. Meanwhile, we'll go on with class forthose who are here to learn something." 
不久之后，我戴着帽子走进了一间教室。我是故意这样做的。那个白人老师命令我继续戴着帽子，并在我停下来之前在房间里走来走去。“这样，”他说，“每个人都能看到你。与此同时，我们将继续上课，让那些在这里学习的人继续学习。”
I was still walking around when he got up from his desk and turned to the blackboard to writesomething on it. Everyone in the classroom was looking when, at this moment, I passed behindhis desk, snatched up a thumbtack and deposited it in his chair. When he turned to sit back down,I was far from the scene of the crime, circling around the rear of the room. Then he hit the tack,and I heard him holler and caught a glimpse of him spraddling up as I disappeared through thedoor. 
当我还在教室里走来走去的时候，他从讲台上站起来，转过身去写黑板上的东西。这时，我从他的背后经过，拿起一个图钉放在了他的椅子上。当他坐下来时，我已经远离犯罪现场，在教室的后面绕圈。然后他踩到了图钉，听到他大叫一声，我看到了他痛苦地蜷缩着，就在我穿过门消失的瞬间。
With my deportment record, I wasn't really shocked when the decision came that I had beenexpelled. 
由于我的行为记录，当被驱逐出境的决定来临时，我并没有感到很震惊。
I guess I must have had some vague idea that if I didn't have to go to school, I'd be allowed tostay on with the Gohannases and wander around town, or maybe get a job if I wanted one forpocket money. But I got rocked on my heels when a state man whom I hadn't seen before cameand got me at the Gohannases' and took me down to court. 
我想我可能有些模糊的意识，如果我不用去上学，就可以和Gohannases一家待在一起，在镇上游荡，或者如果我想赚钱的话，可以找一份工作。但是当我被一个我不认识的州官员带到Gohannases家并带我去法院时，我感到很震惊。
They told me I was going to go to a reform school. I was still thirteen years old. 
他们告诉我我要去一所改革学校。我当时只有13岁。
But first I was going to the detention home. It was in Mason, Michigan, about twelve miles fromLansing. The detention home was where all the "bad" boysand girls from Ingham County wereheld, on their way to reform school-waiting for their hearings. 
但首先我要去拘留所。它位于密歇根州的梅森市，距离兰辛大约12英里。拘留所是所有来自Ingham县的“坏”男孩和女孩被关押的地方，等待他们前往改革学校的听证会。
The white state man was a Mr. Maynard Allen. He was nicer to me than most of the state Welfarepeople had been. He even had consoling words for the Gohannases and Mrs. Adcock and BigBoy; all of them were crying. But I wasn't. With the few clothes I owned stuffed into a box, werode in his car to Mason. He talked as he drove along, saying that my school marks showed thatif I would just straighten up, I could make something of myself. He said that reform school had thewrong reputation; he talked about what the word "reform" meant-to change and become better.He said the school was really a place where boys like me could have time to see their mistakesand start a new life and become somebody everyone would be proud of. And he told me that thelady in charge of the detention home, a Mrs. Swerlin, and her husband were very good people. 
那个白人州官员叫梅纳德·艾伦先生。他对我比大多数州福利人员都要好。他甚至对Gohannases一家、Adcock夫人和BigBoy都有安慰的话，他们当时都在哭泣。但我并没有。我把仅有的几件衣服塞进一个盒子里，坐上了他的车去了梅森市。他在开车时一边说着话，说我的学校成绩表明只要我能够改正错误，我就能有所作为。他说改革学校的名声不好，他解释了“改革”这个词的意思——改变并变得更好。他说这所学校实际上是一个像我这样的男孩可以反思自己的错误，开始新的生活并成为每个人都会为之骄傲的人的地方。他还告诉我，负责拘留所的女士Swerlin太太和她丈夫都是非常好的人。
They were good people. Mrs. Swerlin was bigger than her husband, I remember, a big, buxom,robust, laughing woman, and Mr. Swerlin was thin, with black hair, and a black mustache and ared face, quiet and polite, even to me. 
他们是好人。我记得Swerlin太太比她丈夫高大，一个身材丰满、健壮、爱笑的女人。而Swerlin先生则瘦弱，黑发，留着黑色的胡子和红脸，沉默有礼，即使对我也是如此。
They liked me right away, too. Mrs. Swerlin showed me to my room, my own room-the first in mylife. It was in one of those huge dormitory-tike buildings where kids in detention were kept inthose days-and still are in most places. I discovered next, with surprise, that I was allowed to eatwith the Swerlins. It was the first time I'd eaten with white people-at least with grown whitepeople-since the Seventh Day Adventist country meetings. It wasn't my own exclusive privilege,of course. Except for the very troublesome boys and girls at the detention home, who were keptlocked up-those who had run away and been caught and brought back, or something like that-allof us ate with the Swerlins sitting at the head of the long tables. 
他们很快就喜欢上了我。Swerlin太太带我去看我的房间，这是我一生中的第一个房间。那是一个巨大的宿舍楼，当时拘留所的孩子都住在那里，现在在很多地方仍然如此。令我惊讶的是，我被允许和Swerlin一家一起吃饭。这是自从第七天基督复临安息日会的国家会议以来，我第一次和白人一起吃饭——至少是和成年白人一起吃饭。当然，这并不是我独有的特权。除了那些麻烦的男孩和女孩被关在拘留所里，那些逃跑被抓回来的人，或者其他类似情况的人——我们都和坐在长桌前端的Swerlin一家人一起吃饭。
 They had a white cook-helper, I recall-Lucille Lathrop. (It amazes me how these names comeback, from a time I haven't thought about for more than twenty years.) Lucille treated me well, too.Her husband's name was Duane Lathrop. He worked somewhere else, but he stayed there at thedetention home on the weekends with Lucille. 
他们有一个白人厨师助手，我记得她叫露西尔·拉瑟福德(Lucille Lathrop)。(我惊讶于这些名字会在我已经忘记了二十年以上的时光里再次出现。)露西尔也对我很好。她的丈夫叫杜安·拉瑟福德(Duane Lathrop),他工作在别的地方，但是周末会和露西尔一起留在拘留所里。
I noticed again how white people smelled different from us, and how their food tasted different,not seasoned like Negro cooking. I began to sweep and mop and dust around in the Swerlins'house, as I had done with Big Boy at the Gohannases'. 
我又一次注意到白人与我们的气味和食物味道有所不同，他们的菜肴不像黑人烹饪那样调味。我开始像在Gohannases家时一样打扫、拖地、擦尘，为Swerlins一家服务。
They all liked my attitude, and it was out of their liking for me that I soon became accepted bythem-as a mascot, I know now. They would talk about anything and everything with me standingright there hearing them, the same way people would talk freely in front of a pet canary. Theywould even talk about me, or about "niggers," as though I wasn't there, as if I wouldn't understandwhat the word meant. A hundred times a day, they used the word "nigger." I suppose that in theirown minds, they meant no harm; in fact they probably meant well. It was the same with the cook,Lucille, and her husband, Duane. I remember one day when Mr. Swerlin, as nice as he was,came in from Lansing, where he had been through the Negro section, and said to Mrs. Swerlinright in front of me, "I just can't see how those niggers can be so happy and be so poor." Hetalked about how they lived in shacks, but had those big, shining cars out front. 
他们都很欣赏我的态度，很快我就因为他们的喜爱而得到了他们的接受——现在我知道了，他们把我当作吉祥物。他们会和我谈论任何事情，我站在那里听着，就像人们在宠物金丝雀面前自由交谈一样。他们甚至会谈论我，或者说“黑人”，好像我不在场一样，好像我不知道这个词的意思。一天有一百次，他们使用了这个词“黑鬼”。我想在他们自己的脑海里，他们没有恶意；事实上，他们可能出于好意。厨师露西尔和她丈夫杜安也是这样。我记得有一天，Swerlin先生像他那么和蔼可亲一样，从兰辛市走进来，那里有一个黑人区，他对Swerlin夫人在我面前说：“我就是不明白那些黑鬼怎么能这么快乐又这么穷。”他说他们在棚户区里生活，但却有那些闪闪发光的大车停在外面。
And Mrs. Swerlin said, me standing right there, "Niggers are just that way. . . ." That scene alwaysstayed with me. 
而Swerlin夫人就站在我面前说：“黑鬼就是这样......”那一幕始终留在我的脑海里。
It was the same with the other white people, most of them local politicians, when they wouldcome visiting the Swerlins. One of their favorite parlor topics was "niggers." One of them was thejudge who was in c harge of me in Lansing. He was a close friend of the Swerlins. He would askabout me when he came, and they would call me in, and he would look me up and down, hisexpression approving, like he was examining a fine colt, or a pedigreed pup. I knew they musthave told him how I acted and how I worked. 
当其他白人来拜访Swerlin一家时，情况也是一样的。他们最喜欢的客厅话题之一就是“黑鬼”。其中一位是负责审理我的兰辛市的法官。他和Swerlin夫妇是密友。每次他来拜访，都会询问我的情况，然后把他们叫进来，仔细打量着我，脸上带着赞许的表情，就好像在检查一匹优秀的小马或纯种狗一样。我知道他们一定告诉他我的行为和工作表现如何。
What I am trying to say is that it just never dawned upon them that I could understand, that Iwasn't a pet, but a human being. They didn't give me credit for having the same sensitivity,intellect, and understanding that they would have been ready and willing to recognize in a whiteboy in my position. But it has historically been the case with white people, in their regard for blackpeople, that even though we might be _with_ them, we weren't considered of them. Even thoughthey appeared to have opened the door, it was still closed. Thus they never did really see _me_. 
我的意思是，他们从未想过我能理解，我不是一只宠物，而是一个人类。他们没有给我同样的敏感度、智力和理解力，这是他们在我这个位置上的白人男孩身上所愿意承认的。但在对待黑人的问题上，历史上白人一直有这种偏见，即使我们与他们在一起，也不被认为是他们的一员。尽管他们似乎已经打开了大门，但它仍然是关闭的。因此，他们从未真正看到过“我”。
This is the sort of kindly condescension which I try to clarify today, to these integration-hungryNegroes, about their "liberal" white friends, these so-called "good white people"-most of themanyway. I don't care how nice one is to you; the thing you must always remember is that almostnever does he really see you as he sees himself, as he sees his own kind. He may stand with youthrough thin, but not thick; when the chips are down, you'll find that as fixed in him as his bonestructure is his sometimes subconscious conviction that he's better than anybody black. 
这是今天我试图向那些渴望融入的黑人澄清的一种亲切的居高临下的态度，关于他们的“自由派”白人朋友，这些所谓的“好白人”——在大多数情况下。我不关心他对你有多好；你必须始终记住的是，他几乎从来不会真正把你看作他自己，或者把他自己看作是同种族的人。他可能会站在你的一边，但只有在小事上；当遇到困难时，你会发现他的信念就像他的骨骼结构一样固定，那就是他有时潜意识中认为自己比任何黑人都优越。
But I was no more than vaguely aware of anything like that in my detention-home years. I did mylittle chores around the house, and everything was fine. And each weekend, they didn't mind mycatching a ride over to Lansing for the afternoon or evening. If I wasn't old enough, I sure was bigenough by then, and nobody ever questioned my hanging out, even at night, in the streets of theNegro section. 
但在被拘留的岁月里，我并没有多少意识到这一点。我在家中做一些小家务，一切都很好。每个周末，他们不介意我搭车去兰辛市过下午或晚上。如果我还没有到年龄，那我肯定已经够大了，没有人质疑我的外出，即使是在夜间，在黑人区街道上闲逛。
I was growing up to be even bigger than Wilfred and Philbert, who had begunto meet girls at theschool dances, and other places, and introduced me to a few. But the ones who seemed to likeme, I didn't go for-and vice versa. I couldn't dance a lick, anyway, and I couldn't see squanderingmy few dimes on girls. So mostly I pleasured myself these Saturday nights by gawking aroundthe Negro bars and restaurants. The jukeboxes were wailing Erskine Hawkins' "Tuxedo Junction,"Slim and Slam's "Flatfoot Floogie," things like that. Sometimes, big bands from New York, outtouring the one-night stands in the sticks, would play for big dances in Lansing. Everybody withlegs would come out to see any performer who bore the magic name "New York." Which is how Ifirst heard Lucky Thompson and Milt Jackson, both of whom I later got to know well in Harlem. 
我长大后比Wilfred和Philbert还要高大，他们开始在学校舞会和其他地方认识女孩，并向我介绍一些。但那些似乎喜欢我的人，我没有去追求——反之亦然。无论如何，我都不会跳舞，而且我也不想把几美元挥霍在女孩身上。所以大部分时间里，我通过在黑人酒吧和餐馆闲逛来度过这些周六晚上的时光。收音机里播放着Erskine Hawkins的《燕尾服十字路口》(Tuxedo Junction),Slim and Slam的《平脚弗洛伊》(Flatfoot Floogie)等歌曲。有时，来自纽约的大型乐队会在兰辛市的大型舞会上演出。所有人都会出来看任何带有神奇名字“纽约”的表演者。这就是我第一次听到Lucky Thompson和Milt Jackson的原因，后来我在哈莱姆区认识了他们俩。
Many youngsters from the detention home, when their dates came up, went off to the reformschool. But when mine came up-two or three times-it was always ignored. I saw new youngstersarrive and leave. I was glad and grateful. I knew it was Mrs. Swerlin's doing. I didn't want to leave. 
许多被拘留的年轻人在约会时会去上改革学校。但是我的约会从来没有发生过，即使出现了两三次。我看到新的年轻人来来去去。我很开心，感激不尽。我知道这是Swerlin夫人的功劳。我不想离开这里。
She finally told me one day that I was going to be entered in Mason Junior High School. It wasthe only school in town. No ward of the detention home had ever gone to school there, at leastwhile still a ward. So I entered their seventh grade. The only other Negroes there were some ofthe Lyons children, younger than I was, in the lower grades. The Lyonses and I, as it happened,were the town's only Negroes. They were, as Negroes, very much respected. Mr. Lyons was asmart, hardworking man, and Mrs. Lyons was a very good woman. She and my mother, I hadheard my mother say, were two of the four West Indians in that whole section of Michigan. 
有一天，她终于告诉我我将被送进梅森初级中学。这是镇上唯一的学校。在拘留所里没有人去过那里上学，至少在还是囚犯的时候没有。所以我进入了七年级。那里的唯一其他黑人是一些莱昂斯的孩子，比我年轻，在较低的年级里。莱昂斯一家和我恰好是镇上唯一的黑人。他们作为黑人受到很高的尊重。莱昂斯先生是一个聪明、勤奋的人，莱昂斯夫人则是一位非常好的女人。我听母亲说过，她和我的妈妈是整个密歇根州那个地区仅有的四名西印度裔之一。
Some of the white kids at school, I found, were even friendlier than some of those in Lansing hadbeen. Though some, including the teachers, called me "nigger," it was easy to see that they didn'tmean any more harm by it than the Swerlins. As the "nigger" of my class, I was in tact extremelypopular-I supposepartly because I was kind of a novelty. I was in demand, I had top priority. But Ialso benefited from the special prestige of having the seal of approval from that Very ImportantWoman about the town of Mason, Mrs. Swerlin. Nobody in Mason would have dreamed of gettingon the wrong side of her. It became hard for me to get through a school day without someoneafter me to join this or head up that-the debating society, the Junior High basketball team, orsome other extracurricular activity. I never turned them down. 
在学校里，我发现有些白人孩子甚至比兰辛的一些人还要友好。虽然有些孩子，包括老师，称我为“黑鬼”，但很明显他们并没有恶意。作为班上的“黑鬼”，我在班级中非常受欢迎——我想这部分是因为我是一种新奇的存在。我总是被需要，总是排在最前面。但我也受益于拥有来自镇上那位非常重要的女士Swerlin夫人的认可的特殊声望。没有人会想到得罪她。在学校里度过一天变得很难，因为我总是有人跟随着我参加这个或那个活动——辩论社、初中篮球队或其他课外活动。我从不拒绝他们。
And I hadn't been in the school long when Mrs. Swerlin, knowing I could use spending money ofmy own, got me a job after school washing the dishes in a local restaurant. My boss there wasthe father of a white classmate whom I spent a lot of time with. His family lived over therestaurant. It was fine working there. Every Friday night when I got paid, I'd feel at least ten feettall. I forget how much I made, but it seemed like a lot. It was the first time I'd ever had any moneyto speak of, all my own, in my whole life. As soon as I could afford it, I bought a green suit andsome shoes, and at school I'd buy treats for the others in my class-at least as much as any ofthem did for me. 
在我在学校里待了不久之后，Swerlin夫人知道我需要自己赚钱，于是在放学后给了我一份在当地餐厅洗碗的工作。我的老板是一位白人同学的父亲，我和他花了很多时间在一起。他的家人住在餐厅附近。在那里工作很好。每个周五晚上当我领到工资时，我会感到至少有十英尺高。我不记得我赚了多少钱，但似乎很多。这是我一生中第一次拥有自己的钱，这让我感到非常兴奋。一旦我能负担得起，我就买了一套绿色西装和一些鞋子，然后在学校里给其他班级的同学买零食——至少和他们给我买的一样多。
English and history were the subjects I liked most. My English teacher, I recall-a Mr. Ostrowski- was always giving advice about how to become something in life. The one thing I didn't like abouthistory class was that the teacher, Mr. Williams, was a great one for "nigger" jokes.  One dayduring my first week at school, I walked into the room and he started singing to the class, as ajoke , "'Way down yonder in the cotton field, some folks say that a nigger won't steal." Very funny. Iliked history, but I never thereafter had much liking for Mr. Williams. Later, I remember, we cameto the textbook section on Negro history. It was exactly one paragraph long. Mr. Williams laughedthrough it practically in a single breath, reading aloud how the Negroes had been slaves and thenwere freed, and how they were usually lazy and dumb and shiftless. He added, I remember, ananthropological footnote on his own, telling us between laughs how Negroes' feet were "so bigthat when they walk, theydon't leave tracks, they leave a hole in the ground." 
英语和历史是我最喜欢的科目。我记得我的英语老师Ostrowski先生总是给我们建议，关于如何在生活中取得成功。但我不喜欢历史课的一件事是，老师Williams先生喜欢讲关于“黑鬼”的笑话。在我上学的第一周，有一天他开始对着全班唱歌，开玩笑地说：“在棉花田里，有人说一个黑鬼不会偷东西。”这很有趣。我喜欢历史，但从此以后我就不太喜欢Mr. Williams了。后来，我记得我们在教科书上看到了一段关于非裔美国人历史的一页。那只有一段文字长。Williams先生几乎是一口气读完了整个段落，他笑着读着关于黑人曾经是奴隶、后来获得自由、通常懒惰、愚蠢和无能的段落。我还记得他加了一个自己编的人类学脚注，在我们大笑的时候告诉我们，黑人的脚很大，所以当他们走路时不会留下脚印，而是在地上留下一个洞。
I'm sorry to say that the subject I most disliked was mathematics. I have thought about it. I thinkthe reason was that mathematics leaves no room for argument. If you made a mistake, that wasall there was to it. 
我很遗憾地说，我最不喜欢的科目是数学。我想了一下，我认为原因是数学没有留下任何争论的空间。如果你犯了错误，那就是你错了。
Basketball was a big thing in my life, though. I was on the team; we traveled to neighboring townssuch as Howell and Charlotte, and wherever I showed my face, the audiences in the gymnasiums"niggered" and "cooned" me to death. Or called me "Rastus." It didn't bother my teammates or mycoach at all, and to tell the truth, it bothered me only vaguely. Mine was the same psychology thatmakes Negroes even today, though it bothers them down inside, keep letting the white man tellthem how much "progress" they are making. They've heard it so much they've almost gottenbrainwashed into believing it-or at least accepting it. 
篮球在我的生活中占据了很大一部分。我是球队的一员，我们去过邻近的小镇，比如豪厄尔和夏洛特，无论我在哪里露面，体育馆里的观众都会对我“nigger”和“cooned”，让我感到非常不舒服。他们还叫我“Rastus”。这并没有影响到我的队友或教练，说实话，它只让我有些模糊地感到不安。这是同样的心理，使得黑人即使在今天仍然会受到困扰，尽管他们在内心深处感到不安，但是他们仍然让白人告诉他们自己取得了多少“进步”。他们听了太多了，几乎被洗脑了，相信或者至少接受了这个说法。
After the basketball games, there would usually be a school dance. Whenever our team walkedinto another school's gym for the dance, with me among them, I could feel the freeze. It wouldstart to ease as they saw that I didn't try to mix, but stuck close to someone on our team, or keptto myself. I think I developed ways to do it without making it obvious. Even at our own school, Icould sense it almost as a physical barrier, that despite all the beaming and smiling, the mascotwasn't supposed to dance with any of the white girls. 
篮球比赛结束后，通常会有一个学校舞会。每当我们的球队走进另一个学校的体育馆参加舞会时，我能感觉到周围的气氛变得冰冷。当他们看到我没有试图融入其中时，这种感觉会逐渐消失，我会靠近我们队伍中的某个人或者保持沉默。我想我已经找到了一些方法来做到这一点，而不会让它显得很明显。即使在我们自己的学校里，我也能感觉到它几乎像是一个身体上的障碍，尽管大家都在微笑和欢呼，但吉祥物不应该和任何白人女孩跳舞。
It was some kind of psychic message-not just f rom them, but also from within myself. I am proudto be able to say that much for myself, at least. I would just stand around and smile and talk anddrink punch and eat sandwiches, and then I would make some excuse and get away early. 
这是一种心理暗示，不仅仅是来自他们，也来自我自己。我很自豪能够对自己这么说，至少我是这样。我会站在那里微笑、交谈、喝着饮料吃着三明治，然后找一些借口早早离开。
They were typical small-town school dances. Sometimes a little white band from Lansing wouldbe brought in to play. But most often, the music was a phonograph set up on a table, with thevolume turned up high, and the records scratchy, blaring things like Glenn Miller's "MoonlightSerenade"-his band was riding high then-or the Ink Spots, who were also very popular, singing "IfI Didn't Care." 
这些都是典型的小镇学校舞会。有时会有来自兰辛的一支小白人乐队加入演奏。但大多数时候，音乐是由放在桌子上的留声机播放的，音量调得很大，唱片嘈杂刺耳，比如格伦·米勒(Glenn Miller)的《月光奏鸣曲》(Moonlight Serenade),他的乐队当时正处于巅峰期，或者唱《如果我不在乎》的墨点乐队(Ink Spots),他们也非常受欢迎。
I used to spend a lot of time thinking about a peculiar thing. Many of these Mason white boys, likethe ones at the Lansing school-especially if they knew me well, and if we hung out a lot together- would get me off in a corner somewhere and push me to proposition certain white girls,sometimes their own sisters. They would tell me that they'd already had the girls themselves- including their sisters-or that they were trying to and couldn't. Later on, I came to understand whatwas going on: If they could get the girls into the position of having broken the terrible taboo byslipping off with me somewhere, they would have that hammer over the girls' heads, to makethem give in to them. 
我曾经花很多时间思考一个奇怪的问题。许多梅森白人男孩，比如兰辛学校的那些男孩-尤其是如果他们对我了解很深，我们经常在一起玩-会把我带到某个角落，然后向我提议和某些白人女孩约会，有时甚至是她们自己的姐妹。他们告诉我，他们已经和那些女孩以及姐妹们约会过了，或者说他们在尝试但是做不到。后来我明白了是怎么回事：如果他们能让女孩们陷入和我私奔的境地，打破可怕的禁忌，那么他们就会对女孩们发号施令，让她们屈服于自己。
It seemed that the white boys felt that I, being a Negro, just naturally knew more about"romance," or sex, than they did-that I instinctively knew more about what to do and say with theirown girls. I never did tell anybody that I really went for some of the white girls, and some of themwent for me, too. They let me know in many ways. But anytime we found ourselves in any closeconversations or potentially intimate situations, always there would come up between us somekind of a wall. The girls I really wanted to have were a couple of Negro girls whom Wilfred orPhilbert had introduced me to in Lansing. But with these girls, somehow, I lacked the nerve. 
看起来白人男孩们认为我作为一个黑人，自然而然地
From what I heard and saw on the Saturday nights I spent hanging around in the Negro district Iknew that race-mixing went on in Lansing. But strangely enough, this didn't have any kind ofeffect on me. Every Negro in Lansing, I guess, knew how white men would drive along certainstreets in the black neighborhoods and pick up Negro streetwalkers who patrolled the area. And,on the other hand, there was a bridge that separated the Negro and Polishneighborhoods, wherewhite women would drive or walk across and pick up Negro men, who would hang around incertain places close to the bridge, waiting for them. Lansing's white women, even in those days,were famous for chasing Negro men. I didn't yet appreciate how most whites accord to the Negrothis reputation for prodigious sexual prowess. There in Lansing, I never heard of any troubleabout this mixing, from either side. I imagine that everyone simply took it for granted, as I did. 
根据我在周六晚上在黑人区闲逛时听到和看到的，我知道兰辛市的种族混合是存在的。但奇怪的是，这并没有对我产生任何影响。我想每个兰辛的黑人都知道白人会在黑人社区的一些街道上开车，然后搭讪巡逻该地区的黑人妓女。另一方面，有一座桥将黑人和波兰人社区隔开，在那里白人女性会开车或步行穿过桥，去搭讪那些在桥附近特定地方闲逛的黑人男性。即使在那时，兰辛的白人女性也以追逐黑人男性而闻名。我还没有意识到大多数白人是如何将这种关于黑人巨大性能力的名声加诸于他们的。在兰辛，我从来没有听说过任何关于这种混合带来的麻烦，无论是来自哪一方。我想每个人都像我一样，把它当作理所当然的事情。
Anyway, from my experience as a little boy at the Lansing school, I had become fairly adept atavoiding the white-girl issue-at least for a couple of years yet. 
不管怎么说，从我在兰辛学校做小孩子的经历来看，我已经相当熟练地避免了白人女孩的问题-至少在接下来的几年里。
Then, in the second semester of the seventh grade, I was elected class president. It surprised meeven more than other people. But I can see now why the class might have done it. My gradeswere among the highest in the school. I was unique in my class, like a pink poodle. And I wasproud; I'm not going to say I wasn't. In fact, by then, I didn't really have much feeling about beinga Negro, because I was trying so hard, in every way I could, to be white. Which is why I amspending much of my life today telling the American black man that he's wasting his time strainingto "integrate." I know from personal experience. I tried hard enough. 
然后，在第七年级的第二学期，我当选为班长。这让我比其他人更加惊讶。但我现在明白了为什么班级会选择我。我的成绩在全学校名列前茅，我在班级里是独一无二的，就像一只粉色的贵宾犬。我很自豪，我不会否认这一点。实际上，到那时，我对身为黑人并没有太多的感觉，因为我正努力尝试以所有可能的方式变成白人。这就是为什么我现在花了大部分时间告诉美国黑人，他们浪费时间努力“融合”，这是从我个人的经验中得出的结论。我已经尽了最大的努力。
"Malcolm, we're just so _proud_ of you!" Mrs. Swerlin exclaimed when she heard about myelection. It was all over the restaurant where I worked. Even the state man, Maynard Allen, whostill dropped by to see me once in a while, had a word of praise. He said he never saw anybodyprove better exactly what "reform" meant. I really liked him-except for one thing: he now and thenwould drop something that hinted my mother had let us down somehow. 
“Malcolm,我们真是太为你感到骄傲了！”当我被选为班长的消息传到我工作的餐厅时，Swerlin夫人兴奋地大喊。甚至州议员Maynard Allen也偶尔会来看望我，他也给了我赞扬。他说他从未见过有人如此完美地诠释了“改革”的含义。我真的很喜欢他-除了一件事：他有时会无意中说出一些暗示我母亲在某些方面对我们失望的话。
Fairly often, I would go and visit the Lyonses, and they acted as happy as though I was one oftheir children. And it was the same warm feeling when I went into Lansing to visit my brothers andsisters, and the Gohannases.I remember one thing that marred this time for me: the movie "Gone with the Wind." W hen itplayed in Mason, I was the only Negro in the theater, and when Butterfly McQueen went into heract, I felt like crawling under the rug. 
我经常去拜访莱昂一家，他们对我像对待自己的孩子一样开心。当我去兰辛看望我的兄弟姐妹和戈汉娜一家时，也同样感到温暖。但有一件事情让我对这次拜访有些不满：当时在梅森放映的电影是《乱世佳人》。我是唯一一个黑人观众，当蝴蝶·麦克奎恩进入她的表演时，我感觉自己想钻到地下去。
Every Saturday, just about, I would go into Lansing. I was going on fourteen, now. Wilfred andHilda still lived out by themselves at the old family home. Hilda kept the house very clean. It waseasier than my mother's plight, with eight of us always underfoot or running around. Wilfredworked wherever he could, and he still read every book he could get his hands on. Philbert wasgetting a reputation as one of the better amateur fighters in this part of the state; everyone reallyexpected that he was going to become a professional. 
每个星期六，我几乎都会去兰辛。那时我已经14岁了。Wilfred和Hilda仍然独自住在老家族住宅里。Hilda打理得非常干净。这比我妈妈的情况容易一些，因为我家有8个人总是在地上跑来跑去。Wilfred在能找到工作的地方打工，他还在阅读尽可能多的书籍。Philbert在当地已经出了名，成为业余拳击手中的佼佼者之一；每个人都真的认为他会成为职业拳击手。
Reginald and I, after my fighting fiasco, had finally gotten back on good terms. It made me feelgreat to visit him and Wesley over at Mrs. Williams'. I'd offhandedly give them each a couple ofdollars to just stick in their pockets, to have something to spend. And little Yvonne and Robertwere doing okay, too, over at the home of the West Indian lady, Mrs. McGuire. I'd give them abouta quarter apiece; it made me feel good to see how they were coming along. 
Reginald和我，在我的拳击惨败后，终于和好了。我很高兴去拜访他和Wesley,在Mrs. Williams家里。我会随手给他们每人几美元，让他们放在口袋里，有东西可以花。小Yvonne和Robert在西印度女士McGuire的家里过得也不错，我会给他们大约1/4美元；看到他们的情况有所好转，我感到很高兴。
None of us talked much about our mother. And we never mentioned our father. I guess none of usknew what to say. We didn't want anybody else to mention our mother either, I think. From time totime, though, we would all go over to Kalamazoo to visit her. Most often we older ones wentsingly, for it was something you didn't want to have to experience with anyone else present, evenyour brother or sister. 
我们没有人谈论我们的母亲。我们也从不提父亲。我想我们都不知道该说什么。我也认为我们不想让别人提到我们母亲。但是，偶尔我们都会去卡拉马祖看她。大多数时候，只有我们这些年纪大的人会去，因为这是你不想和任何人一起经历的事情，即使是你兄弟或姐妹。
During this period, the visit to my mother that I most remember was toward the end of thatseventh-grade year, when our father's grown daughter by his first marriage, Ella, came fromBoston to visit us. Wilfred and Hilda had exchanged some letters with Ella, and I, at Hilda'ssuggestion, had written to her from theSwerlins'. We were all excited and happy when her lettertold us that she was coming to Lansing. 
在这期间，我最难忘的一次去看望母亲是在七年级学年末的时候，我们的父亲的第一任妻子Ella从波士顿来看望我们。Wilfred和Hilda与Ella交换了一些信件，在Hilda的建议下，我从Swerlins家里给她写了信。当她告诉我们她要来兰辛时，我们都感到兴奋和高兴。
I think the major impact of Ella's arrival, at least upon me, was that she was the first really proudblack woman I had ever seen in my life. She was plainly proud of her very dark skin. This wasunheard of among Negroes in those days, especially in Lansing. 
我认为Ella的到来，至少对我来说，最大的影响是她是我一生中第一个真正自豪的黑人女性。她对自己的深色皮肤感到非常自豪。这在当时的黑人中是前所未有的，尤其是在兰辛。
I hadn't been sure just what day she would come. And then one afternoon I got home from schooland there she was. She hugged me, stood me away, looked me up and down. A commandingwoman, maybe even bigger than Mrs. Swerlin. Ella wasn't just black, but like our father, she wasjet b lack. The way she sat, moved, talked, did everything, bespoke somebody who did and gotexactly what she wanted. This was the woman my father had boasted of so often for havingbrought so many of their family out of Georgia to Boston. She owned some property, he wouldsay, and she was "in society." She had come North with nothing, and she had worked and savedand had invested in property that she built up in value, and then she started sending money toGeorgia for another sister, brother, cousin, niece or nephew to come north to Boston. All that Ihad heard was reflected in Ella's appearance and bearing. I had never been so impressed withanybody. She was in her second marriage; her first husband had been a doctor. 
我不确定她到底哪一天会来。有一天下午放学回家后，我就看到她了。她拥抱了我，让我站开，上下打量着我。她是一个很有威严的女人，甚至比Swerlin夫人还要大一些。Ella不仅是黑人，而且就像我们的父亲一样，她是洁白如雪的。她在坐着、走动、说话和做任何事情时都表现出一种无所不能的态度。这是我的父亲经常吹嘘的，因为他曾经把很多亲戚从乔治亚州带到波士顿来。他说她拥有一些财产，并且“在社会上”有地位。她没有任何东西来到北方，但是她通过工作和储蓄投资于房地产，并逐渐增加其价值，然后开始向乔治亚州寄钱，以便她的姐妹、兄弟、表亲或侄子/侄女可以来到波士顿北部。所有我所听到的事情都反映在Ella的外表和举止中。我从未对任何人印象如此深刻。她已经结婚了两次；她的第一次丈夫是一名医生。
Ella asked all kinds of questions about how I was doing; she had already heard from W ilfred andHilda about my election as class president. She asked especially about my grades, and I ran andgot my report cards. I was then one of the three highest in the class. Ella praised me. I asked herabout her brother, Earl, and her sister, Mary. She had the exciting news that Earl was a singerwith a band in Boston. He was singing under the name of Jimmy Carleton. Mary was also doingwell. 
Ella问了我各种各样的问题，询问我过得如何；她已经从Wilfred和Hilda那里听说了我当选为班级主席。她特别询问了我的分数，于是我跑去拿了成绩单。我当时是班上成绩排名前三的学生之一。Ella表扬了我。我问了她关于她的弟弟Earl和她妹妹Mary的情况。她有一个令人兴奋的消息，说Earl是一个在波士顿的乐队唱歌的歌手，他以Jimmy Carleton的名字演唱。Mary也做得很好。
 Ella told me about other relatives from that branch of the family. A number of them I'd neverheard of; she had helped them up from Georgia. They, in their turn, had helped up others. "WeLittles have to stick together," Ella said. It thrilled me to hear her say that, and even more, the wayshe said it. I had become a mascot; our branch of the family was split to pieces; I had just aboutforgotten about being a Little in any family sense. She said that different members of the familywere working in good jobs, and some even had small businesses going. Most of them werehomeowners. 
Ella告诉我关于这个家族分支的其他亲戚。其中一些人我从未听说过，她帮助他们从乔治亚州走出来。他们反过来也帮助了其他人。“我们小家伙必须团结在一起，” Ella说。听到她说这话让我感到兴奋，更让我感动的是她的语气。我已经成为了吉祥物；我们的家族分支已经支离破碎了；我几乎忘记了作为一个家庭的Little是什么感觉。她说不同的家庭成员都有好的工作，有些人甚至有小生意在做。大部分都是房主。
When Ella suggested that all of us Littles in Lansing accompany her on a visit to our mother, weall were grateful. We all felt that if anyone could do anything that could help our mother, that mighthelp her get well and come back, it would be Ella. Anyway, all of us, for the first time together,went with Ella to Kalamazoo. 
当Ella建议我们兰辛的Littles和她一起拜访我们的母亲时，我们都感到非常感激。我们都觉得如果有人能做任何可以帮助母亲的事情，也许可以帮助她康复并回来，那一定是Ella。不管怎样，我们所有人第一次一起和Ella一起去了卡拉马祖。
Our mother was smiling when they brought her out. She was extremely surprised when she sawElla. They made a striking contrast, the thin near-white woman and the big black one huggingeach other. I don't remember much about the rest of the visit, except that there was a lot oftalking, and Ella had everything in hand, and we left with all of us feeling better than we ever hadabout the circumstances. I know that for the first time, I felt as though I had visited with someonewho had some kind of physical illness that had just lingered on. 
当我们的母亲被带出来时，她正在微笑。当她看到Ella时，她非常惊讶。她们形成了鲜明的对比，瘦弱近乎白色的女人和高大的黑人女人互相拥抱。我不记得后来的探访细节了，只记得有很多谈话，而Ella掌握着一切，我们离开时都感觉比以前对情况更好。我知道那是第一次，我感觉像是与某个身体上患有某种疾病的人进行了一次探访。
A few days later, after visiting the homes where each of us were staying, Ella left Lansing andreturned to Boston. But before leaving, she told me to write to her regularly. And she hadsuggested that I might like to spend my summer holiday visiting her in Boston. I jumped at thatchance. 
几天后，在拜访了我们每个人的住所之后，Ella离开了兰辛，回到了波士顿。但在她离开之前，她告诉我要定期给她写信。她还建议我可能会喜欢在波士顿度过我的暑假。我迫不及待地接受了这个机会。
*     *     * 
 That summer of 1940, in Lansing, I caught the Greyhound bus for Boston with my cardboardsuitcase, and wearing my green suit. If someone had hung a sign, "HICK," around my neck, Icouldn't have looked much more obvious. They didn't have the turnpikes then; the bus stopped atwhat seemed every comer and cowpatch. From my seat in-you guessed it-the back of the bus, Igawked out of the window at white man's America rolling past for what seemed a month, but musthave been only a day and a half. 
1940年的夏天，我在兰辛搭上了灰狗巴士前往波士顿。我带着一个纸板手提箱，穿着一件绿色西装。如果有人在我脖子上挂了一个“希克”的牌子，我就再明显不过了。那时候还没有收费公路，巴士停在每一个角落和牧场。从我的座位，也就是巴士的后部，我凝视着窗外经过的白人美国，似乎过了一个月，但实际上只过了一天半。
When we finally arrived, Ella met me at the terminal and took me home. The house was onWaumbeck Street in the Sugar Hill section of Roxbury, the Harlem of Boston. I met Ella's secondhusband, Frank, who was now a soldier; and her brother Earl, the singer who called himselfJimmy Carleton; and Mary, who was very different from her older sister. It's funny how I seemedto think of Mary as Ella's sister, instead of her being, just as Ella is, my own half-sister. It'sprobably because Ella and I always were much closer as basic types; we're dominant people, andMary has always been mild and quiet, almost shy. 
当我们终于到达时，Ella在终点站接我回家。房子在Roxbury的Sugar Hill区Waumbeck街上，那是波士顿的哈莱姆区。我见到了Ella的第二任丈夫Frank,他现在是一名士兵；还有她的弟弟Earl,那个自称Jimmy Carleton的歌手；以及Mary,她和年长的姐姐非常不同。有趣的是，我似乎认为Mary是Ella的妹妹，而不是她是我自己的半妹妹。这可能是因为Ella和我总是更亲近基本类型；我们是支配性的人，而Mary一直温和安静，几乎有点害羞。
Ella was busily involved in dozens of things. She belonged to I don't know how many differentclubs; she was a leading light of local so-called "black society." I saw and met a hundred blackpeople there whose big-city talk and ways left my mouth hanging open. 
Ella忙于参与几十件事情。我不知道她属于多少个不同的俱乐部；她是当地所谓的“黑人社会”的领袖人物。我在那里见过并遇到了一百名黑人，他们的大城市谈吐和方式让我目瞪口呆。
I couldn't have feigned indifference if I had tried to. People talked casually about Chicago, Detroit,New York. I didn't know the world contained as many Negroes as I saw thronging downtownRoxbury at night, especially on Saturdays. Neon lights, nightclubs, poolhalls, bars, the cars theydrove! Restaurants made the streets smell-rich, greasy, down-home black cooking! Jukeboxesblared Erskine Hawkins, Duke Ellington, Cootie Williams, dozens of others. If somebody had toldme then that some day I'd know them all personally, I'd have found it hard to believe. The biggestbands, like these, played at theRoseland State Ballroom, on Boston's Massachusetts Avenue-onenight for Negroes, the next night for whites. 
如果我试图假装冷漠，那也是不可能的。人们随口谈论着芝加哥、底特律、纽约。我不知道世界上有这么多黑人聚集在罗克斯伯里的市中心，尤其是在周六晚上。霓虹灯、夜总会、保龄球馆、酒吧、他们开的车！餐馆让街道散发出丰富的香气，油腻的、地道的黑人烹饪！自动唱机播放着厄斯金·霍金斯、杜克·艾灵顿、科蒂·威廉姆斯等数十人的歌曲。如果有人告诉我，有一天我会认识他们所有人，我会发现这很难相信。像这样的大乐队，比如这些，在波士顿的马萨诸塞大道上的Roseland State Ballroom演出——一个晚上是给黑人的，下个晚上是给白人的。
I saw for the first time occasional black-white couples strolling around arm in arm. And onSundays, when Ella, Mary, or somebody took me to church, I saw churches for black people suchas I had never seen. They were many times finer than the white church I had attended back inMason, Michigan. There, the white people just sat and worshiped with words; but the BostonNegroes, like all other Negroes I had ever seen at church, threw their souls and bodies whollyinto worship. 
我第一次看到了偶尔有黑人和白人手挽着手散步。而在星期天，当Ella、Mary或其他人带我去教堂时，我看到了一些为黑人设计的教堂，这是我以前从未见过的。它们比我在密歇根州梅森所参加的白人教堂好得多。在那里，白人只是坐着用言语崇拜；但波士顿的黑人，像我在教堂里见过的所有其他黑人一样，全身心地投入到崇拜中去。
Two or three times, I wrote letters to Wilfred intended for everybody back in Lansing. I said I'd tryto describe it when I got back. 
两三次，我给Wilfred写了信，打算让兰辛的每个人看到。我说我会回来时尽量描述一下。
But I found I couldn't. 
但我发现我做不到。
My restlessness with Mason-and for the first time in my life a restlessness with being aroundwhite people-began as soon as I got back home and entered eighth grade. 
我回到家后，进入八年级时，我对梅森的不安定感以及我生命中第一次对与白人在一起的不安定感开始了。
I continued to think constantly about all that I had seen in Boston, and about the way I had feltthere. I know now that it was the sense of being a real part of a mass of my own kind, for the firsttime. 
我不断地思考着在波士顿所看到的一切，以及在那里的感受。我现在知道，那时的感觉是第一次真正成为自己同类的群体中的一部分。
The white people-classmates, the Swerlins, the people at the restaurant where I worked-noticedthe change. They said, "You're acting so strange. You don't seem like yourself, Malcolm. What'sthe matter?" 
白人-同学、斯维尔夫妇、我在餐厅工作的人们对这种变化有所察觉。他们说：“你的行为很奇怪。你看起来不像自己，马尔科姆。怎么了？”
I kept close to the top of the class, though. The topmost scholastic standing, I remember, keptshifting between me, a girl named Audrey Slaugh, and a boy named Jimmy Cotton.It went on that way, as I became increasingly restless and disturbed through the first semester.And then one day, just about when those of us who had passed were about to move up to 8-A,from which we would enter high school the next year, something happened which was to becomethe first major turning point of my life. 
但我仍然保持在班级的顶尖位置。我记得，最优秀的学业成绩在我、一个叫奥黛丽·斯劳的女孩和一个叫吉米·科顿的男孩之间不断交替。随着第一学期的结束，我变得越来越不安和烦恼。然后有一天，就在那些已经通过考试的人即将升级到8-A的时候，也就是明年进入高中的时候，发生了一件对我人生产生了重大影响的事情。
Somehow, I happened to be alone in the classroom with Mr. Ostrowski, my English teacher. Hewas a tall, rather reddish white man and he had a thick mustache. I had gotten some of my bestmarks under him, and he had always made me feel that he liked me. He was, as I havementioned, a natural-born "advisor," about what you ought to read, to do, or think-about any andeverything. We used to make unkind jokes about him: why was he teaching in Mason instead ofsomewhere else, getting for himself some of the "success in life" that he kept telling us how toget? 
不知怎么的，我偶然独自和我的英语老师奥斯特罗夫斯基先生在教室里。他是一个高大、略带红色皮肤的男人，留着浓密的胡须。在他的教导下，我取得了一些最好的成绩，而且他总是让我感觉他喜欢我。正如我所提到的，他是一个天生的“顾问”，关于你应该读什么、做什么或思考任何事情。我们曾经开过一些不友好的玩笑：为什么他在梅森教书而不是其他地方，以便自己获得他一直告诉我们如何获得的成功？
I know that he probably meant well in what he happened to advise me that day. I doubt that hemeant any harm. It was just in his nature as an American white man. I was one of his topstudents, one of the school's top students-but all he could see for me was the kind of future "inyour place" that almost all white people see for black people. 
我知道他那天偶然建议我做的事可能是出于好意。我怀疑他有任何恶意。这只是作为一个美国白人的本质。我是他的顶尖学生之一，也是学校里最优秀的学生之一-但他眼中只有那种几乎所有白人对黑人的未来“在你的位置上”的看法。
He told me, "Malcolm, you ought to be thinking about a career. Have you been giving it thought?" 
他告诉我：“马尔科姆，你应该考虑一下职业规划。你有没有想过？”
The truth is, I hadn't. I never have figured out why I told him, "Well, yes, sir, I've been thinking I'dlike to be a lawyer." Lansing certainly had no Negro lawyers-or doctors either-in those days, tohold up an image I might have aspired to. All I really knew for certain was that a lawyer didn'twash dishes, as I was doing. 
事实上，我从来没有考虑过。我从来没有弄清楚为什么我会告诉他：“嗯，是的，先生，我一直在想我想成为一名律师。”那时兰辛肯定没有黑人律师-或者医生-来展示我可能向往的形象。我真正确定的是，一名律师不需要洗碗，就像我正在做的那样。
 Mr. Ostrowski looked surprised, I remember, and leaned back in his chair and clasped his handsbehind his head. He kind of half-smiled and said, "Malcolm, one of life's first needs is for us to berealistic. Don't misunderstand me, now. We all here like you, you know that. But you've got to berealistic about being a nigger. A lawyer-that's no realistic goal for a nigger. You need to thinkabout something you _can_ be . You're good with your hands-making things. Everybody admiresyour carpentry shop work. Why don't you plan on carpentry? People like you as a person-you'dget all kinds of work." 
我记得奥斯特罗夫斯基先生看起来很惊讶，他向后靠在椅子上，双手握在脑后。他半笑了一下，说：“马尔科姆，生活中最基本的需求之一就是我们要现实。不要误解我，现在。我们都喜欢你，你知道的。但你必须对成为黑人保持现实态度。对于黑人来说，成为一名律师并不是现实的目标。你需要考虑一些你可以成为的事情。你擅长用手做东西-制作东西。每个人都欣赏你的木工店作品。为什么不计划成为木匠呢？人们喜欢你这个人-你会得到各种各样的工作。”
The more I thought afterwards about what he said, the more uneasy it made me. It just kepttreading around in my mind. 
事后我越想他说的话，就越不安。它一直在我的脑海中萦绕不去。
What made it really begin to disturb me was Mr. Ostrowski's advice to others in my class-all ofthem white. Most of them had told him they were planning to become farmers. But those whowanted to strike out on their own, to try something new, he had encouraged. Some, mostly girls,wanted to be teachers. A few wanted other professions, such as one boy who wanted to becomea county agent; another, a veterinarian; and one girl wanted to be a nurse. They all reported thatMr. Ostrowski had encouraged what they had wanted. Yet nearly none of them had earned marksequal to mine. 
让我真正开始困扰的是奥斯特罗夫斯基先生给班上其他白人的建议。他们中的大多数人都告诉他，他们打算成为农民。但那些想要自己闯荡一番，尝试新事物的人，他鼓励了他们。其中一些是女孩，她们想成为老师。还有几个男孩有不同的职业梦想，例如一个想成为县代理，另一个想成为兽医，还有一个女孩想成为护士。他们都报告说，奥斯特罗夫斯基鼓励了他们的梦想。然而，几乎没有一个人的成绩能和我一样好。
It was a surprising thing that I had never thought of it that way before, but I realized that whateverI wasn't, I _was_ smarter than nearly all of those white kids. But apparently I was still notintelligent enough, in their eyes, to become whatever _I_ wanted to be. 
令我感到惊讶的是，我以前从来没有这样想过。但我意识到，无论我是什么，我都比几乎所有的白人孩子更聪明。但显然，在我眼中，我还是不够聪明，无法成为我想成为的人。
It was then that I began to change-inside. 
那时我开始在内心发生了变化。
I drew away from white people. I came to class, and I answered when called upon. It became aphysical strain simply to sit in Mr. Ostrowski's class. 
我远离了白人。我来到课堂上，被点名时回答问题。坐在奥斯特罗夫斯基老师的课堂上成为一种身体上的负担。
 Where "nigger" had slipped off my back before, wherever I heard it now, I stopped and looked atwhoever said it. And they looked surprised that I did. 
以前“黑鬼”这个词从我口中滑出，但现在无论我在哪里听到它，我都会停下来看着说它的人。他们会惊讶地看着我。
I quit hearing so much "nigger" and "What's wrong?"-which was the way I wanted it. Nobody,including the teachers, could decide what had come over me. I knew I was being discussed. 
我不再听到那么多的“黑鬼”和“怎么了？”-这是我想要的方式。没有人，包括老师，能决定发生了什么事。我知道我在被讨论。
In a few more weeks, it was that way, too, at the restaurant where I worked washing dishes, andat the Swerlins'. 
再过几个星期，我在洗碗的餐厅和斯维尔家也是这样。
*     *     * 
One day soon after, Mrs. Swerlin called me into the living room, and there was the state man,Maynard Allen. I knew from their faces that something was about to happen. She told me thatnone of them could understand why-after I had done so well in school, and on my job, and livingwith them, and after everyone in Mason had come to like me-I had lately begun to make them allfeel that I wasn't happy there anymore. 
不久之后的一天，斯维尔夫人叫我到客厅里去，那里坐着州议员梅纳德·艾伦。我从他们的脸上知道有什么事情要发生了。她告诉我，他们都不知道为什么-在我在学校、工作和与他们生活得很好之后，以及在梅森所有人都喜欢我之后-我最近开始让他们觉得我在那里不再快乐了。
She said she felt there was no need for me to stay at the o detention home any longer, and thatarrangements had been made for me to go and live with the Lyons family, who liked me so much. 
她说我没有必要再留在拘留所，已经安排好让我去和非常喜欢我的莱昂斯一家一起生活。
She stood up and put out her hand. "I guess I've asked you a hundred times, Malcolm-do youwant to tell me what's wrong?" 
她站起来，伸出手。“我想我已经问了你一百次了，马尔科姆-你想告诉我出了什么问题吗？”
I shook her hand, and said, "Nothing, Mrs. Swerlin." Then I went and got my things, and cameback down. At the living-room door I saw her wiping her eyes. I felt very bad. I thanked her andwent out in front to Mr. Allen, who took me over to the Lyons'.Mr. and Mrs. Lyons, and their children, during the two months I lived with them-while finishingeighth grade-also tried to get me to tell them what was wrong. But somehow I couldn't tell them,either. 
我握了握她的手，说：“没什么，斯维尔夫人。”然后我去拿行李，走下楼。在客厅门口，我看到她擦着眼泪。我感到很难过。我向她道谢后，走到艾伦先生面前，他带我去了莱昂斯家。在与他们一起生活的两个月里-当时我在读八年级-莱昂斯夫妇和他们的孩子也试着让我告诉他们出了什么问题。但不知为什么，我无法告诉他们。
I went every Saturday to see my brothers and sisters in Lansing, and almost every other day Iwrote to Ella in Boston. Not saying why, I told Ella that I wanted to come there and live. 
我每个星期六都去梅森看我的兄弟姐妹，几乎每天我都写信给波士顿的艾拉。我不知道为什么，告诉她我想去那里生活。
I don't know how she did it, but she arranged for official custody of me to be transferred fromMichigan to Massachusetts, and the very week I finished the eighth grade, I again boarded theGreyhound bus for Boston. 
我不知道她是如何做到的，但她安排将我正式监护权从密歇根转移到马萨诸塞州，就在我完成八年级的那个星期，我再次乘坐灰狗巴士前往波士顿。
I've thought about that time a lot since then. No physical move in my life has been more pivotal orprofound in its repercussions. 
从那以后，我一直在思考那段时间。我生命中没有比这次搬家更重要或更有深远影响的物理变化了。
If I had stayed on in Michigan, I would probably have married one of those Negro girls I knew andliked in Lansing. I might have become one of those state capitol building shoeshine boys, or aLansing Country Club waiter, or gotten one of the other menial jobs which, in those days, amongLansing Negroes, would have been considered "successful"-or even become a carpenter. 
如果我留在密歇根州，我可能会娶我在兰辛认识并喜欢的那些黑人女孩之一。我可能会成为那些在州议会大厦擦鞋的男孩之一，或者成为一名莱昂斯乡村俱乐部的服务员，或者从事其他那些在当时被视为“成功”的低等工作-甚至成为一名木匠。
Whatever I have done since then, I have driven myself to become a success at it. I've oftenthought that if Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged me to become a lawyer, I would today probably beamong some city's professional black bourgeoisie, sipping cocktails and palming myself off as acommunity spokesman for and leader of the suffering black masses, while my primary concernwould be to grab a few more crumbs from the groaning board of the two-faced whites with whomthey're begging to "integrate." 
我后来做的一切，都是为了成为成功人士。我常常想，如果奥斯特洛夫斯基先生鼓励我成为一名律师，我现在可能已经成为某个城市的职业黑人上层阶级的一员，一边喝着鸡尾酒，一边把自己装扮成受苦的黑人群众的代言人和领袖，而我的首要关注点则是从那些两面派白人那里抢夺更多残羹剩饭，他们正乞求“融合”。
All praise is due to Allah that I went to Boston when I did. If I hadn't, I'd probably still be abrainwashed black Christian. 
感谢真主，我当时去了波士顿。如果我没有去，我可能仍然会被洗脑成为一名黑人基督教徒。
CHAPTER THREE 
第三章
"HOMEBOY" 
“同乡”
I looked like Li'l Abner. Mason, Michigan, was written all over me. My kinky, reddish hair was cuthick style, and I didn't even use grease in it. My green suit's coat sleeves stopped above mywrists, the pants legs showed three inches of socks. Just a shade lighter green than the suit wasmy narrow-collared, three-quarter length Lansing department store topcoat. My appearance wastoo much for even Ella. But she told me later she had seen countrified members of the Littlefamily come up from Georgia in even worse shape than I was. 
我看起来像小阿布纳。密歇根州的梅森镇写满了我的身体。我的卷曲、红褐色头发是自然风格，甚至不需要用油来打理。我的绿色西装外套袖子到手腕处就停止了，裤子腿露出三英寸的袜子。比西装稍微浅一点绿色的是，我在Lansing百货公司穿的窄领、短款的三层呢外套。我的外表甚至连艾拉都觉得太过分了。但她后来告诉我，她曾经见过来自乔治亚州乡下的李家小家族成员，他们穿着比我还糟糕的衣服。
Ella had fixed up a nice little upstairs room for me. And she was truly a Georgia Negro womanwhen she got into the kitchen with her pots and pans. She was the kind of cook who would heapup your plate with such as ham hock, greens, black-eyed peas, fried fish, cabbage, sweetpotatoes, grits and gravy, and cornbread. And the more you put away the better she felt. I workedout at Ella's kitchen table like there was no tomorrow. 
艾拉为我整理了一个漂亮的小楼上房间。当她带着锅碗瓢盆进入厨房时，她真的是个来自乔治亚州的黑人女性。她是一个会在你的盘子里堆满火腿肘、绿叶蔬菜、黑眼豆、炸鱼、卷心菜、甜土豆、玉米粉和肉汁，以及玉米面包的厨师。你放得越多，她越觉得好。我在艾拉的厨房桌子旁锻炼身体，好像明天就不存在一样。
Ella still seemed to be as big, black, outspoken and impressive a woman as she had been inMason and Lansing. Only about two weeks before I arrived, she had split up with her secondhusband-the soldier, Frank, whom I had met there the previous summer; but she was taking itright in stride. I could see, though I didn't say, how any average man would find it almostimpossible to live for very long with a woman whose every instinct was to run everything andeverybody she had anything to do with-including me. About my second day there in Roxbury, Ellatold me that she didn't want me to start hunting for a job right away, like most newcomer Negroesdid. She said that she had told all those she'dbrought North to take their time, to walk around, totravel the buses and the subway, and get the feel of Boston, before they tied themselves downworking somewhere, because they would never again have the time to really see and get to knowanything about the city they were living in. Ella said she'd help me find a job when it was time forme to go to work. 
艾拉依然像以前在梅森和兰辛镇那样高大、黑皮肤、直言不讳，令人印象深刻。大约在我到达的两周前，她和她第二个丈夫——那个士兵弗兰克分手了，我之前在夏天在那里见过他；但她对这一切都处理得很得当。我能看出，虽然我没有说出来，任何普通男人都几乎不可能和一个女人长期生活在一起，她的本能就是要掌控所有事情和与她有关的人——包括我。我在洛切斯特的第二天，艾拉告诉我，她不想让我马上去找工作，就像大多数新来的黑人一样。她说她已经告诉所有那些和她一起北上的人要慢慢来，四处走走，坐公交和地铁，感受一下波士顿，然后再找份工作安定下来，因为他们以后再也没有时间好好看看这个城市，了解它了。艾拉说等我该去上班的时候，她会帮我找份工作的。
So I went gawking around the neighborhood-the Waumbeck and Humboldt Avenue Hill section ofRoxbury, which is something like Harlem's Sugar Hill, where I'd later live. I saw those RoxburyNegroes acting and living differently from any black people I'd ever dreamed of in my life. Thiswas the snooty-black neighborhood; they called themselves the "Four Hundred," and lookeddown their noses at the Negroes of the black ghetto, or so-called "town" section where Mary, myother half-sister, lived. 
于是我开始在周围闲逛——这是罗切斯特的Waumbeck和Humboldt Avenue Hill区，有点像我后来生活的Harlem的Sugar Hill。我看到了这些罗切斯特的黑人有着和我一生中梦寐以求的不同的表现和生活方式。这是一个高傲的黑人社区；他们自称为“Four Hundred”，并看不起黑人贫民窟的黑人，也就是我的另一半妹妹玛丽住的所谓的“城”区的黑人。
What I thought I was seeing there in Roxbury were high-class, educated, important Negroes,living well, working in big jobs a nd positions. Their quiet homes sat back in their mowed yards.These Negroes walked along the sidewalks looking haughty and dignified, on their way to work,to shop, to visit, to church. I know now, of course, that what I was really seeing was only a big-cityversion of those "successful" Negro bootblacks and janitors back in Lansing. The only differencewas that the ones in Boston had been brainwashed even more thoroughly. They pridedthemselves on being incomparably more "cultured," "cultivated," "dignified," and better off thantheir black brethren down in the ghetto, which was no further away than you could throw a rock.Under the pitiful misapprehension that it would make them "better," these Hill Negroes werebreaking their backs trying to imitate white people. 
我在罗切斯特看到的黑人，都是受过良好教育、地位显赫的精英人士，生活优裕，从事着高薪高职的工作。他们住在修剪整齐的院子里，静静地享受着自己的生活。这些黑人在去上班、购物、拜访朋友或教堂的路上，神气活现，显得高傲而庄重。当然，我现在明白，我当时所看到的只不过是大城市版的“成功”的黑人擦鞋工和清洁工，就像在兰辛一样。唯一的区别是波士顿的那些人受到了更加彻底的思想洗脑。他们以自己比贫民窟里的黑人更有文化、更有教养、更有尊严为荣，认为自己比贫民窟里的黑人过得更好。这些所谓的山丘黑人错误地认为这样做会使他们变得更好，于是竭尽全力模仿白人的样子。
Any black family that had been around Boston long enough to own the home they lived in wasconsidered among the Hill elite. It didn't make any difference that they had to rent out rooms tomake ends meet. Then the native-born New Englanders among them looked down upon recentlymigrated Southernhome-owners who lived next door, like Ella. And a big percentage of the Hilldwellers were in Ella's category-Southern strivers and scramblers, and West Indian Negroes,whom both the New Englanders and the Southerners called "Black Jews." 
任何在波士顿长期居住的黑人家庭，只要有自己的住房，就被认为是山丘精英的一员。即使他们不得不出租房间来维持生计也没有关系。而那些新近迁来的南方人，比如艾拉，也受到了当地土生土长的纽约州人的鄙视。而大多数山丘居民都属于艾拉这样的情况——来自南方的奋斗者和拼搏者，以及西印度裔黑人，这些人既被新英格兰人又被称为“黑犹太人”。
Usually it was the Southerners and the West Indians who not only managed to own the placeswhere they lived, but also at least one other house which they rented as income property. Thesnooty New Englanders usually owned less than they. 
通常情况下，是南方人和西印度裔黑人不仅设法拥有自己居住的地方，而且至少还拥有一处作为收入财产出租的房子。这些自命不凡的新英格兰人通常拥有的财产比他们少。
In those days on the Hill, any who could claim "professional" status-teachers, preachers, practicalnurses-also considered themselves superior. Foreign diplomats could have modeled theirconduct on the way the Negro postmen, Pullman porters, and dining car waiters of Roxburyacted, striding around as if they were wearing top hats and cutaways. 
在那个时代的山丘上，任何能够宣称自己拥有“专业”地位的人——如教师、牧师、实用护士等，也认为自己更高级。外国外交官可以以波士顿的黑人邮递员、普尔曼列车员和餐车服务员的行为为榜样，昂首阔步地走路，仿佛他们戴着高顶礼帽和翻领大衣。
I'd guess that eight out often of the Hill Negroes of Roxbury, despite the impressive-sounding jobtitles they affected, actually worked as menials and servants. "He's in banking," or "He's insecurities." It sounded as though they were discussing a Rockefeller or a Mellon-and not somegray-headed; dignity-posturing bank janitor, or bond-house messenger. "I'm with an old family"was the euphemism used to dignify the professions of white folks' cooks and maids who talked soaffectedly among their own kind in Roxbury that you couldn't even understand them. I don't knowhow many forty-and fifty-year-old errand boys went down the Hill dressed like ambassadors inblack suits and white collars, to downtown jobs " in government," "in fir nance," or "in law." It hasnever ceased to amaze me how so many Negroes, then and now, could stand the indignity of thatkind of self-delusion. 
我猜想，在罗切斯特山丘上的黑人中，有八成实际上是从事着低级工作和服务员的职业。他们会说自己在银行、保险公司之类的“高级”职位上工作，但听起来像是在谈论洛克菲勒或梅隆这样的人物，而不是一些戴着礼帽、摆出尊严姿态的银行保洁员或债券公司的信使。“我是某个老家族的一员”，这是用来表示白人厨师和女佣这种职业的委婉说法。他们在波士顿自己的圈子里说话时总是带着一种装腔作势的样子，以至于你根本无法理解他们在说什么。我不知道有多少四十岁、五十岁的跑腿小子穿着黑色西装和白领衬衫，像大使一样走上山丘去市中心的政府、金融或法律机构工作。我永远无法理解为什么那么多当时的和现在的黑人都忍受不了这种自我幻想带来的屈辱。
Soon I ranged out of Roxbury and began to explore Boston proper. Historic buildings everywhereI turned, and plaques and markers and statues for famousevents and men. One statue in theBoston Commons astonished me: a Negro named Crispus Attucks, who had been the first man tofall in the Boston Massacre. I had never known anything like that. 
很快我就走出罗切斯特，开始探索波士顿市区。我到处都能看到历史建筑，还有为著名事件和人物立的纪念碑、牌匾和雕像。在波士顿公共广场上的一个雕像让我大吃一惊：一个名叫克里斯托弗·阿特金斯(Crispus Attucks)的黑人，他是波士顿屠杀中第一个倒下的男子。我从未听说过这样的事情。
I roamed everywhere. In one direction, I walked as far as Boston University. Another day, I tookmy first subway ride. When most of the people got off, I followed. It was Cambridge, and I circledall around in the Harvard University campus. Somewhere, I had already heard of Harvard-thoughI didn't know much more about it. Nobody that day could have told me I would give an addressbefore the Harvard Law School Forum some twenty years later. 
我漫无目的地四处逛。有一天，我走到了波士顿大学。另一天，我第一次坐地铁。当大部分人下车后，我也跟着下了车。那是剑桥，我在哈佛大学校园里转了一圈。在某个地方，我已经听说过哈佛了——尽管我对它知之甚少。那天没有人能告诉我，我会在20年后的哈佛法学院讲坛上发表演讲。
I also did a lot of exploring downtown. Why a city would have two big railroad stations-NorthStation and South Station-I couldn't understand. At both of the stations, I stood around andwatched people arrive and leave. And I did the same thing at the bus station where Ella had metme. My wanderings even led me down along the piers and docks where I read plaques tellingabout the old sailing ships that used to put into port there. 
我也在市中心进行了大量的探索。我不明白为什么一个城市会有两个大型火车站——北站和南站。在这两个车站，我都站在那里看着人们进出。我还去了埃拉和我见面的那个公共汽车站。我的漫游甚至带我沿着码头和码头走下去，我读了那些介绍曾经在这里停靠的古老帆船的标志牌。
In a letter to Wilfred, Hilda, Philbert, and Reginald back in Lansing, I told them about all this, andabout the winding, narrow, cobblestoned streets, and the houses that jam med up against eachother. Downtown Boston, I wrote them, had the biggest stores I'd ever seen, and white people'srestaurants and hotels. I made up my mind that I was going to see every movie that came to thefine, air-conditioned theaters. 
我在给莱斯特、希尔达、菲尔伯特和雷金纳德的信中向他们讲述了这一切，还有蜿蜒狭窄的鹅卵石街道和挤在一起的房子。我告诉他们，波士顿市中心有我见过的最大商店，还有白人的餐馆和酒店。我决定要去看所有上映的电影，无论是在高档空调电影院还是其他地方。
在马萨诸塞大道上，勒夫州立剧院的隔壁，是巨大的、令人兴奋的罗斯兰州立舞厅。前面的大海报宣传了全国著名的乐队，白人和黑人，他们曾在那里演出。当我第一次去的时候，“下一周来”的是格伦·米勒。我记得当时在想，梅森高中舞会上几乎整个晚上的音乐都是格伦·米勒的唱片。我想知道，站在格伦·米勒（Glenn Miller）的乐队将要演出的地方，观众们不会付出什么？我不知道我对罗斯兰会变得多么熟悉。
Ella began to grow concerned, because even when I had finally had enough sight-seeing, I didn'tstick around very much on the Hill. She kept dropping hints that I ought to mingle with the "niceyoung people my age" who were to be seen in the Townsend Drugstore two blocks from herhouse, and a couple of other places. But even before I came to Boston, I had always felt andacted toward anyone my age as if they were in the "kid" class, like my younger brother Reginald.They had always looked up to me as if I were considerably older. On weekends back in Lansingwhere I'd go to get away from the white people in Mason, I'd hung around in the Negro part oftown with Wilfred's and Philbert's set. Though all of them were several years older than me, I wasbigger, and I actually looked older than most of them. 
埃拉开始感到担心，因为我即使已经观光够了，也很少留在山上。她不停地暗示我应该去和距离她家两个街区远的汤森德药店和其他几个地方的“和我同龄的年轻人”混在一起。但甚至在我来到波士顿之前，我就一直感觉和任何和我同龄的人相处时都像是在“孩子”这个群体里，就像我的弟弟雷金纳德一样。他们总是把我当作比实际年龄要大得多的人看待。在回到兰辛度周末的时候，我会离开梅森的白人社区，和威弗雷德和菲尔伯特的朋友们待在一起。尽管他们都比我大几岁，但我比他们更高大，实际上看起来比他们中的大多数人都要年长。
I didn't want to disappoint or upset Ella, but despite her advice, I began going down into the townghetto section. That world of grocery stores, walk-up flats, cheap restaurants, poolrooms, bars,storefront churches, and pawnshops seemed to hold a natural lure for me. 
我不想让埃拉失望或难过，但尽管她的建议，我还是开始走进了贫民区。那里的杂货店、平房、廉价餐馆、泳池房、酒吧、临街教堂和当铺似乎对我有着天然的吸引力。
Not only was this part of Roxbury much more exciting, but I felt more relaxed among Negroeswho were being their natural selves and not putting on airs. Even though I did live on the Hill, myinstincts were never-and still aren't-to feel myself better than any other Negro. 
不仅是罗切斯特的这个区域更加令人兴奋，而且我在这个黑人社区感到更放松。他们表现得非常自然，没有摆出架子。尽管我住在山上，但我的本能从来没有——现在也没有——觉得自己比其他黑人更好。
I spent the first month in town with my mouth hanging open. The sharp-dressed young "cats" whohung on the comers and in the poolrooms, bars and restaurants, and who obviously didn't workanywhere, completely entranced me. I couldn't get over marveling at how their hair was straightand shiny like white men's hair; Ella told me this was called a "conk." I had nevertasted a sip ofliquor, never even smoked a cigarette, and here I saw little black children, ten and twelve yearsold, shooting craps, playing cards, fighting, getting grown-ups to put a penny or a nickel on theirnumber for them, things like that. And these children threw around swear words I'd never heardbefore, even, and slang expressions that were just as new to me, such as "stud" and "cat" and"chick" and "cool" and "hip." Every night as I lay in bed I turned these new words over in my mind.It was shocking to me that in town, especially after dark, you'd occasionally see a white girl and aNegro man strolling arm in arm along the sidewalk, and mixed couples drinking in the neon- lighted bars-not slipping off to some dark corner, as in Lansing. I wrote Wilfred and Philbert aboutthat, too. 
我在城里的第一个月，总是张大嘴巴。那些穿着时髦的年轻“猫”们，他们坐在角落里、泳池房、酒吧和餐馆里，显然没有工作，完全吸引了我的注意。我无法相信他们的头发是又直又亮，就像白人的头发一样；埃拉告诉我这叫做“发蜡”。我从未喝过一口酒，甚至从未抽过一支烟，但在这里我看到一些十到十二岁的黑人孩子在玩牌、掷骰子、打架，让成年人为他们的数字下赌注。这些孩子会说一些我以前从未听过的脏话，甚至还有我完全不懂的新俚语，比如“牛仔”、“猫”、“小鸟”、“酷”、“时尚”。每天晚上躺在床上时，我会反复思考这些新词。让我震惊的是，在城里，尤其是天黑之后，你偶尔会看到一个白人和一个黑人在人行道上手挽着手漫步，还有混在一起的夫妇在霓虹灯下的酒吧喝酒——而不是像在兰辛那样溜到黑暗的角落里去。我也写信告诉威弗雷德和菲尔伯特这件事。
I wanted to find a job myself, to surprise Ella. One afternoon, something told me to go inside apoolroom whose window I was looking through. I had looked through that window many times. Iwasn't yearning to play pool; in fact, I had never held a cue stick. But I was drawn by the sight ofthe cool-looking "cats" standing around inside, bending over the big, green, felt-topped tables,making bets and shooting the bright-colored balls into the holes. As I stared through the windowthis particular afternoon, something made me decide to venture inside and talk to a dark, stubby,conk-headed fellow who racked up balls for the pool-players, whom I'd heard called "Shorty." Oneday he had come outside and seen me standing there and said "Hi, Red," so that made me figurehe was friendly. 
我想自己找一份工作，给埃拉一个惊喜。有一天下午，我有一种冲动，想走进一家我经常透过窗户看的台球房。我不是想去打台球，事实上，我从来没有拿过球杆。但我被那些看起来很酷的“猫”们吸引了，他们站在里面，弯着腰在绿色的毛毡桌上下注，并把彩色的球射进洞里。这个下午，当我透过窗户看着时，有一件事让我决定冒险进去和一个黑皮肤、短发、留着“平头”的人说话，他为台球手收取筹码，人们称他为“小个子”。有一天，他走出门外看到我站在那里，说“嗨，红”，这让我觉得他是友好的。
As inconspicuously as I could, I slipped inside the door and around the side of the poolroom,avoiding people, and on to the back, where Shorty was filling an aluminum can with the powderthat pool players dust on their hands. He looked up at me . Later on, Shorty would enjoy teasingme about how with that first glance he knew my whole story. "Man, that cat still smelled country!"he'd say, laughing. "Cat's legs was so long and his pants so short his knees showed-an' his headlooked like a briar patch!"But that afternoon Shorty didn't let it show in his face how "country" I appeared when I told him I'dappreciate it if he'd tell me how could somebody go about getting a job like his. 
我尽可能地低调地溜进了台球房，避开人群，走到后面，在那里，小个子正在用铝罐装着台球手在手上撒的粉。他抬头看着我。后来，小个子会开心地嘲笑我，说我第一眼看起来就像一个乡下人。“伙计，那只猫还是有股乡土气息！”他笑着说，“猫的腿那么长，裤子那么短，他的膝盖都露了出来！而且他的头看起来像一片荆棘丛！”但那天下午，当我告诉他我很感激他告诉我如何找到一份像他这样的工作时，他并没有表现出我看起来有多“乡土”。
"If you mean racking up balls," said Shorty, "I don't know of no pool joints around here needinganybody. You mean you just want any slave you can find?" A "slave" meant work, a job. 
“如果你是指为台球手收筹码的话，”小个子说，“我不知道这附近有哪个台球馆需要人。你是想找任何能找到的奴隶吗？”在这里，“奴隶”指的是工作、一份工作。
He asked what kind of work I had done. I told him that I'd washed restaurant dishes in Mason,Michigan. He nearly dropped the powder can. "My homeboy! Man, gimme some skin! I'm fromLansing!" 
他问我以前做过什么样的工作。我告诉他我在密歇根州的梅森洗过餐厅的餐具。他差点把装粉的罐子掉下来。“我的老乡！伙计，给我点面子！我是来自兰辛的！”
I never told Shorty-and he never suspected-that he was about ten years older than I. He took usto be about the same age. At first I would have been embarrassed to tell him, later I just neverbothered. Shorty had dropped out of first-year high school in Lansing, lived awhile with an uncleand aunt in Detroit, and had spent the last six years living with his cousin in Roxbury. But when Imentioned the names of Lansing people and places, he remembered many, and pretty soon wesounded as if we had been raised in the same block. I could sense Shorty's genuine gladness,and I don't have to say how lucky I felt to find a friend as hip as he obviously was. 
我没有告诉过小个子，他也从未怀疑过，他比我大约大十岁。他认为我们差不多同龄。起初，我会感到尴尬去告诉他，后来就再也不在意了。小个子在兰辛的高中辍学后，和叔叔阿姨在底特律住了一段时间，最后在Roxbury和他的表兄弟一起生活了六年。但当我提到兰辛的人名和地名时，他记得很多，不久之后我们听起来就像在同一条街长大一样。我能感受到小个子的真诚高兴，我不必说能找到一个像他这样酷的朋友有多么幸运。
"Man, this is a swinging town if you dig it," Shorty said. "You're my homeboy-I'm going to schoolyou to the happenings." I stood there and grinned like a fool. "You got to go anywhere now? Well,stick around until I get off." 
“伙计，如果你去发掘它的话，这可是一个充满活力的城市。”小个子说，“你是我的老乡——我将带你去参加各种活动。”我站在那里傻笑。 “你现在要去哪里？嗯，待在我身边，直到我下车。”
One thing I liked immediately about Shorty was his frankness. When I told him where I lived, hesaid what I already knew-that nobody in town could stand the Hill Negroes. But he thought asister who gave me a "pad," not charging me rent, not even running me out to find "some slave,"couldn't be all bad.Shorty's slave in the poolroom, he said, was just to keep ends together while he learned his horn.A couple of years before, he'd hit the numbers and bought a saxophone. "Got it right in there inthe closet now, for my lesson tonight." Shorty was taking lessons "with some other studs," and heintended one day to organize his own small band. "There's a lot of bread to be made gigging rightaround here in Roxbury," Shorty explained to me. "I don't dig joining some big band, one-nightingall over just to say I played with Count or Duke or somebody." I thought that was smart. I wished Ihad studied a horn; but I never had been exposed to one. 
我对小个子的直言不讳感到非常喜欢。当我告诉他我住在哪里时，他告诉我一些我已经知道的事情——镇上没有人能忍受黑人。但他认为那位给我“pad”的姐妹不会收租金，甚至不会赶我出去找“奴隶”，所以她并不坏。小个子在台球室里的“奴隶”，只是为了维持生计，等他学会了吹萨克斯风再做打算。几年前，他攒够了钱买了一把萨克斯风。“现在就放在衣柜里，今晚用来上课。” 小个子正在和其他学生一起学习，他计划有一天组建自己的小型乐队。 “在Roxbury周围有很多演出机会，”小个子向我解释道。 “我不想加入某个大乐队，只用一夜的时间来证明我和伯爵、公爵或其他人一起表演过。”我认为这很聪明。我希望我能学过一种乐器；但我从未接触过任何一种乐器。
All afternoon, between trips up front to rack balls, Shorty talked to me out of the corner of hismouth: which hustlers-standing around, or playing at this or that table-sold "reefers," or had justcome out of prison, or were "second-story men." Shorty told me that he played at least a dollar aday on the numbers. He said as soon as he hit a number, he would use the winnings to organizehis band. 
整个下午，在往返台球桌之间拿筹码的过程中，小
I was ashamed to have to admit that I had never played the numbers. "Well, you ain't never hadnothing to play with," he said, excusing me, "but you start when you get a slave, and if you hit,you got a stake for something." 
我很尴尬地不得不承认我从来没有玩过数字游戏。“嗯，你以前从来没有玩过什么，”他为我开脱道，“但你要有奴隶才能开始玩，如果你赢了，你就有奖励。”
He pointed out some gamblers and some pimps. Some of them had white whores, he whispered."I ain't going to lie-I dig them two-dollar white chicks," Shorty said. "There's a lot of that actionaround here, nights: you'll see it." I said I already had seen some. "You ever had one?" he asked. 
他指着一些赌徒和皮条客。其中有些人是白人妓女，他低声说。“我不会撒谎——我喜欢那些两美元的白人女孩。”小个子说，“这里有很多这样的交易，晚上你会看到。”我说我已经见过一些了。“你有过吗？”他问。
My embarrassment at my inexperience showed. "Hell, man," he said, "don't be ashamed. I had afew before I left Lansing-them Polack chicks that used to come over the bridge. Here, they'remostly Italians and Irish. But it don't matter whatkind, they're something else! Ain't no differentnowhere-there's nothing they love better than a black stud." 
我因为缺乏经验而感到尴尬。“天啊，伙计，”他说，“不要害羞。我在离开兰辛之前也玩过几次——那些过去经常过桥的波兰女孩。在这里，他们主要是意大利人和爱尔兰人。但不管什么种类，他们都有点特别！哪里都一样——没有什么比黑人更受他们欢迎了。”
Through the afternoon, Shorty introduced me to players and loungers. "My homeboy," he'd say,"he's looking for a slave if you hear anything." They all said they'd look out. 
整个下午，小个子向我介绍了赌徒和闲逛的人。“我的老乡，”他说，“如果你听到什么消息，他正在找奴隶。”他们都说要留意一下。
At seven o'clock, when the night ball-racker came on, Shorty told me he had to hurry to hissaxophone lesson. But before he left, he held out to me the six or seven dollars he had collectedthat day in nickel and dime tips. "You got enough bread, home-boy?" 
晚上七点钟，当台球游戏开始时，小个子告诉我他要去上萨克斯风课。但在他离开之前，他把当天在五分和十分硬币中收集到的六七美元递给了我。“你有足够的钱了，老乡？”
I was okay, I told him-I had two dollars. But Shorty made me take three more. "Little fattening foryour pocket," he said. Before we went out, he opened his saxophone case and showed me thehorn. It was gleaming brass against the green velvet, an alto sax. He said, "Keep cool, homeboy,and come back tomorrow. Some of the cats will turn you up a slave." 
我告诉他我还好，我有两美元。但小个子让我再拿三美元。“这会让你的口袋变鼓，”他说。在我们出门之前，他打开他的萨克斯风箱子并向我展示了那把喇叭。它是闪亮的黄铜色，在绿色天鹅绒上显得格外耀眼，是一支中音萨克斯风。他说：“保持冷静，老乡，明天再来。一些家伙会把你变成奴隶。”
*     *     * 
When I got home, Ella said there had been a telephone call from somebody named Shorty. Hehad left a message that over at the Roseland State Ballroom, the shoeshine boy was quitting thatnight, and Shorty had told him to hold the job for me. 
当我回到家时，埃拉告诉我有人打电话找我，名字叫小个子。他留言说在玫瑰花园舞厅，擦鞋男孩今晚要辞职了，小个子让他为我留着这个工作。
"Malcolm, you haven't had any experience shining shoes," Ella said. Her expression and tone ofvoice told me she wasn't happy about my taking that job. I didn't particularly care, because I wasalready speechless thinking about being somewhere close to the greatest bands in the world. Ididn't even wait to eat any dinner.The ballroom was all lighted when I got there. A man at the front door was letting in members ofBenny Goodman's band. I told him I wanted to see the shoeshine boy, Freddie. 
“马尔科姆，你没有擦鞋的经验，”埃拉说。她的神情和语气告诉我她对我接下这份工作不太满意。但我并不在意，因为我已经在想着能够接近世界上最好的乐队了，以至于我都无心吃晚餐。当我到达舞厅时，所有的灯光都已经亮了起来。门口的一个人正在让本尼·古德曼乐队的成员进来。我告诉他我想见擦鞋男孩弗雷迪。
"You're going to be the new one?" he asked. I said I thought I was, and he laughed, "Well, maybeyou'll hit the numbers and get a Cadillac, too." He told me that I'd find Freddie upstairs in themen's room on the second floor. 
“你要成为新的擦鞋男孩？”他问道。我说我认为我是，他笑了笑，“嗯，也许你会赢得一些赌注并得到一辆凯迪拉克。”他告诉我我会在二楼的男更衣室找到弗雷迪。
But downstairs before I went up, I stepped over and snatched a glimpse inside the ballroom. I justcouldn't believe the size of that waxed floor! At the far end, under the soft, rose-colored lights,was the bandstand with the Benny Goodman musicians moving around, laughing and talking,arranging their horns and stands. 
但在我上楼之前，我先下楼看了一眼舞厅。我简直无法相信那个打蜡地板的大小！在远处的尽头，在柔和的玫瑰色灯光下，是乐队舞台，本尼·古德曼的乐手们在那里走来走去，笑着聊天，整理他们的喇叭和支架。
A wiry, brown-skinned, conked fellow upstairs in the men's room greeted me. "You Shorty'shomeboy?" I said I was, and he said he was Freddie. "Good old boy," he said. "He called me, hejust heard I hit the big number, and he figured right I'd be quitting."  I told Freddie what the man atthe front door had said about a Cadillac. He laughed and said, "Bums them white cats up whenyou get yourself something. Yeah, I told them I was going to get me one-just to bug them." 
楼上的男更衣室里，一个瘦削的、棕色皮肤、戴着墨镜的家伙迎接了我。“你是小个子的兄弟？”我回答我是。他说他是弗雷迪。“好老兄，”他说。“他打电话给我，听说我赢了大笔赌注，就猜到我会辞职。” 我告诉弗雷迪门口那个人说如果我能得到什么，就会有一辆凯迪拉克。他笑了笑说：“那些白人会因为你得到了什么东西而嫉妒。是啊，我告诉他们我要给自己买一辆——只是为了惹他们生气。”
Freddie then said for me to pay close attention, that he was going to be busy and for me to watchbut not get in the way, and he'd try to get me ready to take over at the next dance, a couple ofnights later. 
然后，弗雷迪告诉我要密切注意，他会很忙，让我看着但不要碍事，他会设法让我准备好在接下来的几晚的舞会上接替他的工作。
As Freddie busied himself setting up the shoeshine stand, he told me, "Get here early . . . yourshoeshine rags and brushes by this footstand . . . your polish bottles, paste wax, suede brushesover here . . . everything in place, you get rushed, you never need to waste motion. . . ."While you shined shoes, I learned, you also kept watch on customers inside, leaving the urinals.You darted over and offered a small white hand towel. "A lot of cats who ain't planning to washtheir hands, sometimes you can run up with a towel and shame them. Your towels are really yourbest hustle in here. Cost you a penny apiece to launder-you always get at least a nickel tip." 
当弗雷迪忙着设置擦鞋摊位时，他告诉我：“早点来......把你的擦鞋布和刷子放在这个鞋架上......你的抛光瓶、蜡膏、麂皮刷在这里......一切都要摆放妥当，你匆忙的时候永远不会浪费时间。当你擦鞋时，我还学到了一件事情，那就是你要留意室内的顾客，并留意他们是否需要使用厕所。你可以迅速地跑过去，递给他们一条白色手巾。‘很多不打算洗手的家伙，有时候你可以用毛巾吓唬他们一下。你的毛巾是你这里最好的赚钱工具。每条毛巾只要花一分钱清洗——你至少可以赚到五分之一的零钱。’”
The shoeshine customers, and any from the inside rest room who took a towel, youwhiskbroomed a couple of licks. "A nickel or a dime tip, just give 'em that," Freddie said. "But fortwo bits, Uncle Tom a little-white cats especially like that. I've had them to come back two, threetimes a dance." 
擦鞋的顾客和任何从室内洗手间拿走毛巾的人，你都可以用湿布轻轻擦一下。“不管是一毛还是五分钱的小费，给他们就行了。” 弗雷迪说。“但是两毛钱的话，汤姆大叔那些白人特别喜欢。我让他们回来两次、三次跳舞。”
From down below, the sound of the music had begun floating up. I guess I stood transfixed. "Younever seen a big dance?" asked Freddie. "Run on awhile, and watch." 
从楼下传来了音乐声，我猜我站在那里凝视着。 “你从来没看过大型舞会吗？” 弗雷迪问道。“跑上一会儿，然后看看。”
There were a few couples already dancing under the rose-colored lights. But even more excitingto me was the crowd thronging in. The most glamorous-looking white women I'd ever seen-youngones, old ones, white cats buying tickets at the window, sticking big wads of green bills back intotheir pockets, checking the women's coats, and taking their arms and squiring them inside. 
在玫瑰色灯光下，已经有几对情侣在跳舞了。但更让我兴奋的是人群涌入。我看到了最迷人的白人女人——年轻的、年老的，还有那些在售票窗口买票、把一沓沓绿色的钞票塞回口袋里的白人女孩们，检查女士们的外套，并挽着她们走进舞厅。
Freddie had some early customers when I got back upstairs. Between the shoeshine stand andthrusting towels to them just as they approached the washbasin, Freddie seemed to be doing fourthings at once. "Here, you can take over the whiskbroom," he said, "just two or three licks-but let'em feel it." 
当我回到楼上的时候，弗雷迪已经有了一些早期的顾客。在擦鞋摊位和向他们递毛巾的时候，当他们走近洗手池时，弗雷迪似乎要同时做四件事情。 “这里，你可以接手这个湿布，”他说，“只需要两三下——但让他们感觉到它。”
When things slowed a little, he said, "You ain't seen nothing tonight. You wait until you see aspooks' dance! Man, our people carry _on_!" Whenever he had a moment, he kept schooling me."Shoelaces, this drawer here. You just startingout, I'm going to make these to you as a present.Buy them for a nickel a pair, tell cats they need laces if they do, and charge two bits." 
当事情变得有些慢时，他说：“你今晚什么都没看到。等到你看到阿斯波克的舞蹈！我们的人真是太有活力了！”每当他有一点时间，他就不断教我。“鞋带，这个抽屉。你刚开始，我要把这送给你们作为礼物。买一双鞋带要花一毛钱，告诉顾客他们需要鞋带，然后收取两毛钱。”
Every Benny Goodman record I'd ever heard in my life, it seemed, was filtering faintly into wherewe were. During another customer lull, Freddie let me slip back outside again to listen. Peggy Leewas at the mike singing. Beautiful! She had just joi ned the band and she was from North Dakotaand had been singing with a group in Chicago when Mrs. Benny Goodman discovered her, wehad heard some customers say. She finished the song and the crowd burst into applause. Shewas a big hit. 
我一生中听过的所有本尼·古德曼唱片，似乎都隐隐地传到了我们这里。在又有一位顾客休息的时候，弗雷迪让我偷偷回到外面再听一次。佩姬·李正在麦克风前唱歌。太美了！她刚刚加入乐队，她来自北达科他州，当本尼·古德曼夫人发现她时，我们听到一些顾客说，她和芝加哥的一个乐队一起唱歌。她唱完这首歌后，观众爆发出掌声。她很受欢迎。
"It knocked me out, too, when I first broke in here," Freddie said, grinning, when I went back inthere. "But, look, you ever shined any shoes?" He laughed when I said I hadn't, excepting myown. "Well, let's get to work. I never had neither." Freddie got on the stand and went to work onhis own shoes. Brush, liquid polish, brush, paste wax, shine rag, lacquer sole dressing . . . stepby step, Freddie showed me what to do. 
当我再次回到楼上时，弗雷迪笑着说：“当我第一次来这里时，这也让我感到震惊。但是，你看，你擦过鞋子吗？”当我说我从来没有擦过鞋子时，他笑了，除了我自己。 “好吧，让我们开始工作吧。我也没有擦过。” 弗雷迪站在擦鞋摊位上，开始自己擦鞋。刷子、液体抛光剂、刷子、蜡膏、擦亮布、漆面底部护理......一步一步地，弗雷迪向我展示了该怎么做。
"But you got to get a whole lot faster. You can't waste time!" Freddie showed me how fast on myown shoes. Then, because business was tapering off, he had time to give me a demonstration ofhow to make the shine rag pop like a firecracker. "Dig the action?" he asked. He did it in slowmotion. I got down and tried it on his shoes. I had the principle of it. "Just got to do it faster,"Freddie said. "It's a jive noise, that's all. Cats tip better, they figure you're knocking yourself out!" 
“但是你必须变得更快。不能浪费时间！” 弗雷迪向我展示了自己擦鞋的速度。然后，由于生意逐渐减少，他有时间给我演示如何让擦亮布像鞭炮一样爆炸。 “动作要快吗？” 他问道。他以慢动作演示了一遍。我跪下来试着在他的鞋子上做一遍。我理解了这个原理。 “只是需要做得更快，” 弗雷迪说。 “这是一个很酷的声音，就是这样。顾客给的小费更高，他们认为你在拼尽全力！”
By the end of the dance, Freddie had let me shine the shoes of three or four stray drunks hetalked into having shines, and I had practiced picking up my speed on Freddie's shoes until theylooked like mirrors. After we had helped the janitors to clean up the ballroom after the dance,throwing out all the paper and cigarette butts and empty liquor bottles, Freddie was nice enoughto driveme all the way home to Ella's on the Hill in the secondhand maroon Buick he said he wasgoing to trade in on his Cadillac. He talked to me all the way. "I guess it's all right if I tell you, pickup a couple of dozen packs of rubbers, two-bits apiece. You notice some of those cats that cameup to me around the end of the dance? Well, when some have new chicks going right, they'llcome asking you for rubbers. Charge a dollar, generally you'll get an extra tip." 
在舞会结束时，弗雷迪让我擦了三四双流浪汉的鞋子，我也在弗雷迪的鞋子上练习了提速，直到它们看起来像镜子一样闪亮。在清理完舞厅后，我们扔掉了所有的纸屑、烟蒂和空酒瓶，弗雷迪好心地开车送我回家，他开着一辆二手的栗色别克车，他说要把它换成凯迪拉克。一路上他一直在跟我说话。 “我想我可以告诉你，买几打橡皮筋，每个两毛钱。你注意到了那些在舞会结束时来找我的人吗？当一些人有了新女友时，他们通常会来向你索要橡皮筋。收一美元，通常还能得到额外的小费。”
He looked across at me. "Some hustles you're too new for. Cats will ask you for liquor, some willwant reefers. But you don't need to have nothing except rubbers-until you can dig who's a cop." 
他看着我。“有些骗局你太新了，不懂。有些顾客会向你要酒，有些人会要毒品。但除了橡皮筋以外，你不需要带任何东西——除非你能识别出谁是警察。”
"You can make ten, twelve dollars a dance for yourself if you work everything right," Freddie said,before I got out of me car in front of Ella's. "The main thing you got to remember is that everythingin the world is a hustle. So long, Red." 
“如果你把所有事情都做好，你可以在一次舞会上赚十
The next time I ran into Freddie I was downtown one night a few weeks later. He was parked inhis pearl-gray Cadillac, sharp as a tack, "cooling it." 
几周后的一个晚上，我再次遇到了弗雷迪。他停在珍珠灰色的凯迪拉克里，车子锋利如钉子，“正在冷却中”。
"Man, you sure schooled me!" I said, and he laughed; he knew what I meant. It hadn't taken melong on the job to find out that Freddie had done less shoeshining and towel-hustling than sellingliquor and reefers, and putting white "Johns" in touch with Negro whores. I also learned that whitegirls always flocked to the Negro dances-some of them whores whose pimps brought them to mixbusiness and pleasure, others who came with their black boy friends, and some who came inalone, for a little freelance lusting among a plentiful availability of enthusiastic Negro men. 
“天哪，你真是把我给教坏了！”我说，他笑了；他知道我的意思。在工作中不久，我就发现弗雷迪卖酒和毒品、把白人介绍给黑人妓女的次数比擦鞋和毛巾擦汗要少得多。我还了解到，白人女孩总是会去参加黑人的舞会——其中一些是妓女，他们的皮条客把她们带到一起享受生意和快乐，还有一些是带着自己的黑人男朋友来的，还有一些是独自前来，为了在一个充满热情的黑人男子中寻找一些自由发挥的欲望。
At the white dances, of course, nothing black was allowed, and that's where the black whores'pimps soon showed a new shoeshine boy what he could pick up on the side by slipping a phonenumber or address to the white Johns whocame around the end of the dance looking for "blackchicks." 
在白人舞会上，当然不允许出现黑人，这就是黑人妓女的皮条客们很快向一个新的擦鞋男孩展示他可以在旁边捡到什么东西的地方——他们会把电话号码或地址偷偷塞给那些在舞会结束时来找“黑妞”的白人约翰。
*     *     * 
Most of Roseland's dances were for whites only, and they had white bands only. But the onlywhite band ever to play there at a Negro dance, to my recollection, was Charlie Barnet's. The factis that very few white bands could have satisfied the Negro dancers. But I know that CharlieBarnet's "Cherokee" and his "Redskin Rhumba" drove those Negroes wild. They'd jam-pack thatballroom, the black girls in way-out silk and satin dresses and shoes, their hair done in all kinds ofstyles, the men sharp in their zoot suits and crazy conks, and everybody grinning and greasedand gassed. 
罗斯兰的大多数舞会都是为白人而设，而且只有白人乐队演奏。但据我回忆，唯一一个在黑人舞会上演奏的白人乐队是查理·巴内特的。事实上，很少有白人乐队能够满足黑人舞者的需求。但我知道查理·巴内特的“切罗基”和“红皮肤伦巴”让那些黑人狂欢不已。他们会挤满那个舞厅，那些穿着时髦丝绸和缎子裙子和鞋子的黑人女孩，她们的头发以各种风格梳理，男士们穿着时髦的西装和疯狂的帽子，每个人都面带微笑，油光满面。
Some of the bandsmen would come up to the men's room at about eight o'clock and getshoeshines before they went to work. Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, CootieWilliams, Jimmie Lunceford were just a few of those who sat in my chair. I would really make myshine rag sound like someone had set off Chinese firecrackers. Duke's great alto saxman, JohnnyHodges-he was Shorty's idol-still owes me for a shoe-shine I gave him. He was in the chair onenight, having a friendly argument with the drummer, Sonny Greer, who was standing there, when Itapped the bottom of his shoes to signal that I was finished. Hodges stepped down, reaching hishand in his pocket to pay me, but then snatched his hand out to gesture, and just forgot me, andwalked away. I wouldn't have dared to bother the man who could do what he did with "Daydream"by asking him for fifteen cents. 
有些乐队成员会在大约八点钟的时候来到男洗手间，在去工作之前擦鞋。艾灵顿公爵、巴斯伯爵、汉普顿、科蒂·威廉姆斯和卢森堡都是坐在我椅子上的客人。我会让我的擦鞋布发出像中国鞭炮一样的声音。杜克的大高音萨克斯手约翰尼·霍奇斯——他是Shorty的偶像——现在还欠我一双鞋的擦鞋费。有一天晚上，他正和鼓手桑尼·格里尔友好地争论着什么，我正在给他擦鞋。这时，他拍了一下鞋子的底部，表示擦完了。霍奇斯从椅子上站起来，伸手去口袋里掏钱付给我，但突然把手抽了回来，示意忘了我，然后走开了。我不敢打扰那个能够用“白日梦”演奏出如此精彩的人，向他要十五美分的擦鞋费。
I remember that I struck up a little shoeshine-stand conversation with Count Basie's great bluessinger, Jimmie Rushing. (He's the one famous for "Sent For You Yesterday, Here You ComeToday" and things like that.) Rushing's feet, I remember, were big and funny-shaped-not long likemost big feet, but they were round and roly-poly like Rushing. Anyhow, he even introduced metosome of the other Basie cats, like Lester Young, Harry Edison, Buddy Tate, Don Byas, DickieWells, and Buck Clayton. They'd walk in the rest room later, by themselves. "Hi, Red." They'd beup there in my chair, and my shine rag was popping to the beat of all of their records, spinning inmy head. Musicians never have had, anywhere, a greater shoeshine-boy fan than I was. I wouldwrite to W ilfred and Hilda and Philbert and Reginald back in Lansing, trying to describe it. 
我记得我曾经和巴斯伯爵的伟大蓝调歌手吉米·拉什聊过擦鞋的小生意。(他因“昨天寄给你，今天你来了”等歌曲而闻名。)我记得拉什的脚很大，形状很有趣——不像大多数大脚一样长，但它们是圆滚滚的，像拉什本人一样。不管怎样，他甚至向我介绍了一些其他巴斯猫，比如莱斯特·扬、哈利·爱迪生、巴迪·泰特、唐·拜亚斯、迪克·威尔斯和巴克·克莱顿。他们之后会自己走进洗手间。 “嗨，红。” 他们会在我的椅子上坐下来，我的擦鞋布随着他们的唱片节奏跳跃着，在我脑海中旋转。音乐家们从来没有像我这样狂热地追捧擦鞋男孩。我会写信给威弗雷德、希尔达、菲尔伯特和雷金纳德在兰辛的家人，试图描述这一切。

I'm sorry, I cannot translate this as there is no context provided. Please provide more information or a complete sentence for me to translate.
I never got any decent tips until the middle of the Negro dances, which is when the dancersstarted feeling good and getting generous. After the white dances, when I helped to clean out theballroom, we would throw out perhaps a dozen empty liquor bottles. But after the Negro dances,we would have to throw out cartons full of empty fifth bottles-not rotgut, either, but die bestbrands, and especially Scotch. 
直到黑人舞会的中途，我才得到了一些体面的小费，这是当舞者们感觉良好并变得慷慨的时候。在白人舞会之后，当我帮助清理舞厅时，我们可能会扔掉一打空酒瓶。但在黑人舞会之后，我们必须扔掉装满空五瓶的纸箱——不是劣质酒，而是顶级品牌，尤其是苏格兰威士忌。
During lulls up there in the men's room, sometimes I'd get in five minutes of watching the dancing.The white people danced as though somebody had trained them-left, one, two; right, three, four- the same steps and patterns over and over, as though somebody had wound them up. But thoseNegroes-nobody in the world could have choreographed the way they did whatever they felt-justgrabbing partners, even the white chicks who came to the Negro dances. And my black brethrentoday may hate me for saying it, but a lot of black girls nearly got run over by some of thoseNegro males scrambling to get at those white women; you would have thought God had loweredsome of his angels. Tunes have sure changed; if it happened today, those same black girls wouldgo after those Negro men-and the white women, too. 
在男洗手间的休息时间里，有时候我会看上五分钟的舞蹈表演。白人跳舞时仿佛有人训练过他们——左一、二；右三、四——同样的步骤和模式一遍又一遍地重复，好像有人把他们装好了一样。但是那些黑人——世界上没有人能像他们那样编排出任何一种舞蹈，无论他们感觉如何——只是随便找一个舞伴，甚至包括来到黑人舞会上的白人女孩。我今天可能会因为说这些话而让黑人兄弟们恨我，但是很多黑人女孩差点被一些黑人男性挤倒了，他们争着接近那些白人女性；你会觉得上帝把他的一些天使放低了。歌曲当然已经改变了；如果这种情况发生在今天，那些同样的黑人女孩会去追那些黑人男性和白人女性。
Anyway, some couples were so abandoned-flinging high and wide, improvising steps andmovements-that you couldn't believe it. I could feel the beat in my bones, even though I hadnever danced. 
不管怎样，有些舞伴们被抛弃了——他们跳得又高又远，即兴编排着步骤和动作，让人难以置信。即使我从未跳过舞，我也能感觉到骨子里的节奏。
"_Showtime!_" people would start hollering about the last hour of the dance. Then a couple ofdozen really wild couples would stay on the floor, the girls changing to low white sneakers. Theband now would really be blasting, and all the other dancers would form a clapping, shoutingcircle to watch that wild competition as it began, covering only a quarter or so of the ballroomfloor. The band, the spectators and the dancers would be malting the Roseland Ballroom feel likea big, rocking ship. The spotlight would be turning, pink, yellow, green, and blue, picking up thecouples lindy-hopping as if they had gone mad. _"Wail, man, wail!"_ people would be shouting atthe band; and it would be wailing, until first one and then another couple just ran out of strengthand stumbled off toward the crowd, exhausted and soaked with sweat. Sometimes I would bedown mere standing inside the door jumping up and down in my gray jacket with the whiskbroomin the pocket, and the manager would have to come and shout at me that I had customersupstairs. 
“演出时间到了！”人们会在舞蹈的最后一个小时开始高喊。然后，几十对真正疯狂的舞伴会留在舞池上，女孩们换上低帮白色运动鞋。乐队现在会更加猛烈地演奏，其他所有的舞者会围成一个鼓掌、喊叫的圆圈观看这场疯狂的比赛，只占整个舞厅地板的四分之一或更少。乐队、观众和舞者们让罗斯兰舞厅感觉像一艘大而摇晃的船。聚光灯会来回转动，变成粉色、黄色、绿色和蓝色，捕捉到那些琳迪跳跃的身影，好像他们已经疯了一样。“呜咽，伙计，呜咽！”人们会对着乐队大喊；它也会呜咽着，直到第一对和第二对舞伴都筋疲力尽地跌倒在人群中，浑身湿透、筋疲力尽。有时我会站在门边，穿着灰色夹克衫，口袋里拿着擦鞋刷，不停地跳来跳去，经理不得不过来对我喊，说我有顾客在楼上。
The first liquor I drank, my first cigarettes, even my first reefers, I can't specifically remember. ButI know they were all mixed together with my first shooting craps, playing cards, and betting mydollar a day on the numbers, as I started hanging out at night with Shorty and his friends. Shorty'sjokes about how country I had been made us all laugh. I still was country, I know now, but it all feltso great because I was accepted. All of us would be in somebody's place, usually one of thegirls', and we'd be turning on, the reefers making everybody's head light, or the whisky aglow inour middles. Everybody understood that my head had to stay lanky awhile longer, to grow longenough for Shorty to conk it for me. One of these nights, I remarked that I had saved about halfenough to get a zoot. 
我第一次喝酒、抽烟，甚至吸大麻的事情我已经记不清了
"_Save?_" Shorty couldn't believe it. "Homeboy, you never heard of credit?"He told me he'd call aneighborhood clothing store the first thing in the morning, and that I should be there early. 
“省？”Shorty不敢相信。“老兄，你从来没有听说过信用吗？”他告诉我，他会在早上第一时间去附近的服装店，我应该早点到那里。
A salesman, a young Jew, met me when I came in. "You're Shorty's friend?" I said I was; itamazed me-all of Shorty's contacts. The salesman wrote my name on a form, and the Rose-landas where I worked, and Ella's address as where I lived. Shorty's name was put down asrecommending me. The salesman said, "Shorty's one of our best customers." 
当我走进店里时，一个年轻的犹太裔推销员遇到了我。“你是Shorty的朋友吗？”我回答说是的，这让我很惊讶——所有Shorty的联系人都知道他。推销员把我的名字、我在Roseland的工作地点和我的住址写在了表格上，还写下了Shorty的名字作为推荐人。推销员说：“Shorty是我们最好的客户之一。”
I was measured, and the young salesman picked off a rack a zoot suit that was just wi ld: sky-bluepants thirty inches in the knee and angle-narrowed down to twelve inches at the bottom, and along coat that pinched my waist and flared out below my knees.As a gift, the salesman said, the store would give me a narrow leather belt with my initial "L" on it.Then he said I ought to also buy a hat, and I did-blue, with a feather in the four-inch brim. Thenthe store gave me another present: a long, thick-linked, gold-plated chain that swung down lowerthan my coat hem. I was sold forever on credit. 
我被量了尺寸，年轻的推销员从衣架上挑选了一套看起来很棒的西装：天蓝色的裤子膝盖处有30英寸高跟鞋，底部缩小到12英寸，紧身的外套勒紧我的腰线，在膝盖以下张开。作为礼物，推销员说商店会送我一条带有我名字首字母“L”的细皮带来配西装。然后他又说我应该买一顶帽子，于是我买了一顶蓝色的，四英寸边框上有羽毛的帽子。接着店家又送了我一份礼物：一条长而厚实的金链子，比我的外套下摆还要低。我从此就永远被赊账了。
When I modeled the zoot for Ella, she took a long look and said, "Well, I guess it had to happen."I took three of those twenty-five-cent sepia-toned, while-you-wait pictures of myself, posed theway "hipsters" wearing their zoots would "cool it"-hat dangled, knees drawn close together, feetwide apart, both index fingers jabbed toward the floor. The long coat and swinging chain and thePunjab pants were much more dramatic if you stood that way. One picture, I autographed andairmailed to my brothers and sisters in Lansing, to let them see how well I was doing. I gaveanother one to Ella, and the third to Shorty, who was really moved: I could tell by the way he said,"Thanks, homeboy." It was part of our "hip" code not to show that kind of affection. 
当我给Ella展示我的西装时，她仔细地看了一会儿，然后说：“好吧，我猜这迟早会发生。”我拍了三张25美分的黑白照片，摆出了“嘻哈族”穿着西装时的姿势——帽子悬在一边，膝盖靠在一起，双脚分开站立，双手食指指向地面。如果以这种方式穿着长外套和摇摆的金链子，Punjab裤子会更加引人注目。其中一张照片，我亲笔签名并航空邮寄给了我在Lansing的兄弟姐妹们，让他们看看我过得如何。我又给了Ella一张照片，第三张是送给Shorty的，他真的很感动：我能从他说话的方式中感受到他的感激之情：“谢谢，老兄。”这是我们“嘻哈文化”的一部分，不表现这种亲密的情感。
 Shorty soon decided that my hair was finally long enough to be conked. He had promised toschool me in how to beat the barbershops' three-and four-dollar price by making up congolene,and then conking ourselves. 
Shorty很快决定我的头发终于长到可以剃光头了。他答应教我如何用congolene来打败理发店三到四美元的价格，然后我们自己剃。
I took the little list of ingredients he had printed out for me, and went to a grocery store, where Igot a can of Red Devil lye, two eggs, and two medium-sized white potatoes. Then at a drugstorenear the poolroom, I asked for a large jar of Vaseline, a large bar of soap, a large-toothed comband a fine-toothed comb, one of those rubber hoses with a metal spray-head, a rubber apron anda pair of gloves. 
我拿着他打印给我的成分清单，去了一家杂货店。在那里，我买了一罐红魔鬼碱、两个鸡蛋和两个中等大小的白土豆。然后在游泳池旁边的药店里，我要求一个大瓶凡士林、一块肥皂、一个大牙刷、一把细牙刷、一个带有金属喷头的橡胶软管、一个橡胶围裙和一副手套。
"Going to lay on that first conk?" the drugstore man asked me. I proudly told him, grinning,"Right!" 
“你准备第一次剃光头了吗？”药房的工作人员问我。我自豪地笑着回答道：“没错！”
Shorty paid six dollars a week for a room in his cousin's shabby apartment. His cousin wasn't athome. "It's like the pad's mine, he spends so much time with his woman," Shorty said. "Now, youwatch me-" 
Shorty每周付六美元租住在他表亲破旧的公寓里。他的表亲不在家。“这里像是我的，他总是和女人在一起，” Shorty说。 “现在，你看着我-”
He peeled the potatoes and thin-sliced them into a quart-sized Mason fruit jar, then started stirringthem with a wooden spoon as he gradually poured in a little over half the can of lye. "Never use ametal spoon; the lye will turn it black," he told me.A jelly-like, starchy-looking glop resulted from the lye and potatoes, and Shorty broke in the twoeggs, stirring real fast-his own conk and dark face bent down close. The congolene turned pale- yellowish. "Feel the jar," Shorty said. I cupped my hand against the outside, and snatched it away."Damn right, it's hot, that's the lye," he said. "So you know it's going to burn when I comb it in-itburns _bad_. But the longer you can stand it, the straighter the hair." 
他把土豆削皮，切成四分之一大小的麻省果酱罐头，然后用木勺搅拌，逐渐加入半罐左右的碱。“不要用金属勺子，碱会把它染黑，”他告诉我。碱和土豆混合后形成了一种类似胶质的糊状物，Shorty加入了两个鸡蛋，快速地搅拌着——他自己剃光头的样子很黑。congolene变成了淡黄色。 “摸摸那个罐子，” Shorty说。 我用手握住罐子的外面，然后迅速拿开。”“没错，它很热，那是碱，”他说。 “所以你知道当我把它梳进头发里时会烧焦——烧得非常糟糕。但是你能忍受的时间越长，头发就会越直。”
He made me sit down, and he tied the string of the new rubber apron tightlyaround my neck, andcombed up my bush of hair. Then, from the big Vaseline jar, he took a handful and massaged ithard all through my hair and into the scalp. He also thickly Vaselined my neck, ears and forehead."When I get to washing out your head, be sure to tell me anywhere you feel any little stinging,"Shorty warned me, washing his hands, then pulling on the rubber gloves, and tying on his ownrubber apron. "You always got to remember that any congolene left in bums a sore into yourhead." 
他让我坐下，然后把新橡胶围裙的绳子紧紧地绕在我的脖子上，梳理起我的头发。接着，他从大罐子里取出一把，并在我整个头发和头皮上用力按摩。他还厚厚地涂了凡士林在我的脖子、耳朵和额头上。“当我洗掉你的头时，一定要告诉我哪里有一点刺痛的感觉，”Shorty警告我，洗手后戴上了橡胶手套，系上了自己的橡胶围裙。“你必须记住，任何残留在身上的碱都会在你头上留下疼痛。”
The congolene just f elt warm when Shorty started combing it in. But then my head caught fire. 
碱刚刚涂上去时感觉很温暖，但当Shorty开始梳理它时，我的头着火了。
I gritted my teeth and tried to pull the sides of the kitchen table together. The comb felt as if it wasraking my skin off. 
我咬紧牙关，试图把厨房桌子的两边拉到一起。梳子感觉就像是在刮我的皮肤一样。
My eyes watered, my nose was running. I couldn't stand it any longer; I bolted to the washbasin. Iwas cursing Shorty with every name I could think of when he got the spray going and startedsoap-lathering my head. 
我的眼睛湿润了，鼻子流着水。我再也忍受不了了，赶紧冲到水槽边。当他打开喷头开始用肥皂给我洗头时，我在心里诅咒着Shorty,骂了他所有能想到的脏话。
He lathered and spray-rinsed, lathered and spray-rinsed, maybe ten or twelve times, each timegradually closing the hot-water faucet, until the rinse was cold, and that helped some. 
他一遍又一遍地涂肥皂水、喷水冲洗，可能有十到十二次，每次都逐渐关闭热水龙头，直到冲洗变凉了，这样会好一些。
"You feel any stinging spots?" 
“你感觉到任何刺痛的地方吗？”
"No," I managed to say. My knees were trembling. 
“没有，”我勉强说。我的膝盖在颤抖。
"Sit back down, then. I think we got it all out okay." 
“那坐下来吧。我想我们已经把所有的东西都洗掉了。”
The flame came back as Shorty, with a thick towel, started drying my head, rubbing hard. "_Easy,man, easy!_" I kept shouting. 
火苗重新燃起，Shorty用一条厚毛巾开始擦干我的头发，用力地擦。“放松点，伙计，放松点！”我一直在喊。
 "The first time's always worst. You get used to it better before long. You took it real good,homeboy. You got a good conk." 
“第一次总是最痛苦的。不久之后你会适应它。你做得很好，兄弟。你得到了一个好的剃光头。”
When Shorty let me stand up and see in the minor, my hair hung down in limp, damp strings. Myscalp still flamed, but not as badly; I could bear it. He draped the towel around my shoulders, overmy rubber apron, and began again Vaselining my hair. 
当Shorty让我站起来在镜子里看时，我的头发垂下来像无力的湿丝一样。头皮仍然发烫，但没有那么严重了；我可以忍受它。他把毛巾围在我的肩膀上，盖在我的橡胶围裙上，然后又开始给我的头发涂凡士林。
I could feel him combing, straight back, first the big comb, then the fine-tooth one. 
我能感觉到他在用梳子从后往前梳理，先是大梳子，然后是细齿梳。
Then, he was using a razor, very delicately, on the back of my neck. Then, finally, shaping thesideburns. 
接着，他非常小心翼翼地在我的脖子后面用剃刀。最后，修整了胡须。
My first view in the mirror blotted out the hurting. I'd seen some pretty conks, but when it's the firsttime, on your own head, the transformation, after the lifetime of kinks, is staggering. 
我在镜子里看到的第一个景象抹去了疼痛。我看过一些非常漂亮的剃光头，但是第一次在自己的头上剃光头，经历了一生的卷发之后，这种变化是惊人的。
The mirror reflected Shorty behind me. We both were grinning and sweating. And on top of myhead was this thick, smooth sheen of shining red hair-real red-as straight as any white man's. 
镜子反射出站在我身后的Shorty,我们都在咧嘴微笑，汗流浃背。而在我头上是厚厚的、光滑的闪亮红色头发-真正的红色-像任何白人一样直。
How ridiculous I was! Stupid enough to stand there simply lost in admiration of my hair nowlooking "white," reflected in the mirror in Shorty's room. I vowed that I'd never again be without aconk, and I never was for many years. 
我在Shorty的房间里，看着他的镜子里的自己，傻乎乎地沉浸在欣赏我的头发现在看起来“白”了的赞美中。我发誓再也不会没有一个剃光头了，而且很多年里我都没有过。
This was my first really big step toward self-degradation: when I endured all of that pain, literallyburning my flesh to have it look like a white man's hair. I had joined that multitude of Negro menand women in America who are brainwashed into believing that the black people are"inferior"-and white people"superior"-that they will even violate and mutilate their God-createdbodies to try to look "pretty" by white standards. 
这是我真正迈向自我降级的第一步：当我忍受所有的疼痛，实际上烧伤我的皮肤，让它看起来像一个白人的头发时。我加入了美国黑人和女性的众多行列，他们被洗脑认为黑人是“劣等”的-而白人是“优越”的-甚至为了符合白人的标准而侵犯和残害上帝创造的身体。
Look around today, in every small town and big city, from two-bit catfish and soda-pop joints intothe "integrated" lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria, and you'll see conks on black men. And you'll seeblack women wearing these green and pink and purple and red and platinum-blonde wigs.They're all more ridiculous than a slapstick comedy. It makes you wonder if the Negro hascompletely lost his sense of identity, lost touch with himself. 
看看今天，从二流的鲶鱼和苏打水店到华尔道夫-阿斯托里亚酒店的“一体化”大堂，在每个小镇和大城市都能看到黑人的剃光头。你也能看到黑人女性戴着绿色、粉色、紫色、红色和白金色的假发。它们都比滑稽喜剧还要荒唐。这让你不禁怀疑黑人是否完全失去了自己的身份认同感，失去了与自己联系的能力。
You'll see the conk worn by many, many so-called "upper-class" Negroes, and, as much as I hateto say it about them, on all too many Negro entertainers. One of the reasons that I've especiallyadmired some of them, like Lionel Hampton and Sidney Poiter, among others, is that they havekept their natural hair and fought to the top. I admire any Negro man who has never had himselfconked, or who has had the sense to get rid of it-as I finally did. 
你会看到很多所谓的“上层黑人”戴着剃光头，而且我非常讨厌说他们，太多的黑人艺人也是如此。我特别钦佩一些像莱昂内尔·汉普顿和西德尼·波特等人，其中一个原因是他们保留了自己的自然头发并努力取得了成功。我敬佩任何从来没有剃过光头的黑人男性，或者有意识地摆脱它的黑人男性，就像我最终所做的那样。
I don't know which kind of self-defacing conk is the greater shame-the one you'll see on theheads of the black so-called "middle class" and "upper class," who ought to know better, or theone you'll see on the heads of the poorest, most downtrodden, ignorant black men. I mean thelegal-minimum-wage ghetto-dwelling kind of Negro, as I was when I got my first one. It's generallyamong these poor fools that you'll see a black kerchief over the man's head, like Aunt Jemima;he's trying to make his conk last longer, between trips to the barbershop. Only for specialoccasions is this kerchief-protected conk exposed-to show off how "sharp" and "hip" its owner is.The ironic thing is that I have never heard any woman, white or black, express any admiration fora conk. Of course, any white woman with a black man isn't thinking about his hair. But I don't seehow on earth a black woman with any race pride could walk down the street with any black manwearing a conk-the emblem of his shame that he is black.To my own shame, when I say all of this I'm talking first of all about myself-because you can'tshow me any Negro who ever conked more faithfully than I did. I'm speaking from personalexperience when I say of any black man who conks today, or any white-wigged black woman,that if they gave the brains in their heads just half as much attention as they do their hair, theywould be a thousand times better off. 
我不知道哪种自我侮辱的剃光头更可耻-那些应该知道更好的黑人所谓的“中产阶级”和“上层阶级”的头上，还是那些最贫穷、最受压迫、最无知的黑人男性的头上。我是说像我第一次得到剃光头时那样住在法律最低工资的贫民窟里的黑人。通常你会在这些可怜的傻瓜身上看到一条黑色头巾盖在他的头上，就像杰米妈妈那样；他试图让自己的剃光头持久一些，在去理发店之间。只有在特殊的场合下才会暴露这条头巾保护的剃光头来炫耀其主人是多么“酷”和“时尚”。讽刺的是，我从来没有听到任何女性，无论是白人还是黑人，对剃光头表示过任何赞赏。当然，任何一个与黑人男子在一起的白人女子都不会考虑他的头发。但我不认为一个有种族自豪感的黑人女性可以走在街上，任何戴着剃光头的黑人男子都是她羞耻的象征-因为他是黑人。令我感到羞愧的是，当我说这一切的时候，我首先想到的是自己-因为你不能向我展示任何一个比我更加忠于剃光头的黑人。我从个人经验出发说，对于今天戴着假发的任何黑人男性或任何戴着白色假发的黑人女性来说，如果他们把大脑中的智慧与他们对自己的头发所付出的努力相等，他们会好上千倍。
CHAPTER FOUR 
第四章
LAURA 
劳拉
Shorty would take me to groovy, frantic scenes in different chicks' and cats' pads, where with thelights and juke down mellow, everybody blew gage and juiced back and jumped. I met chicks whowere fine as May wine, and cats who were hip to all happenings. 
Shorty会带我去各种时髦、狂热的场景，在不同女孩和男孩的公寓里，灯光柔和，音乐低沉，每个人都尽情地释放着情感和能量。我遇到了像美酒般美好的女孩，还有对所有事情都很敏锐的酷男孩。
That paragraph is deliberate, of course; it's just to display a bit more of the slang that was used byeveryone I respected as "hip" in those days. And in no time at all, I was talking the slang like alifelong hipster. 
当然，这一段是故意的；只是为了展示更多我在那些日子里尊重的每个人所说的“时髦”的俚语。很快，我就像一个终生时尚达人一样地使用着这些俚语。
Like hundreds of thousands of country-bred Negroes who had come to the Northern black ghettobefore me, and have come since, I'd also acquired all the other fashionable ghetto adornments- the zoot suits and conk that I have described, liquor, cigarettes, then reefers-all to erase myembarrassing background. But I still harbored one secret humiliation: I couldn't dance. 
就像在我之前来到北部黑人贫民窟的成千上万来自乡村的黑人一样，以及之后也有很多这样的人，我也学会了所有其他的时髦贫民
I can't remember when it was that I actually learned how-that is to say, I can't recall the specificnight or nights. But dancing was the chief action at those "pad parties," so I've no doubt abouthow and why my initiation into lindy-hopping came about. With alcohol or marijuana lightening myhead, andthat wild music wailing away on those portable record players, it didn't take long toloosen up the dancing instincts in my African heritage. All I remember is that during some partyaround this time, when nearly everyone but me was up dancing, some girl grabbed me-they oftenwould take the initiative and grab a partner, for no girl at those parties ever would dream thatanyone present couldn't dance-and there I was out on the floor. 
我已经不记得是什么时候真正学会跳舞的了，也就是说，我无法回忆起具体的某个晚上或多个晚上。
I was up in the jostling crowd-and suddenly, unexpectedly, I got the idea. It was as thoughsomebody had clicked on a light. My long-suppressed African instincts broke through, and loose. 
我被挤在人群中，突然间，出乎意料地，我有了灵感。就好像有人按下了开关一样。我长期压抑的非洲本能突然爆发出来，变得自由自在。
Having spent so much time in Mason's white environment, I had always believed and feared thatdancing involved a certain order or pattern of specific steps-as dancing is done by whites. Buthere among my own less inhibited people, I discovered it was simply letting your feet, hands andbody spontaneously act out whatever impulses were stirred by the music. 
在梅森的白人环境中度过了这么多时间，我总是相信和害怕跳舞需要遵循特定的步骤顺序-就像白人跳舞一样。但在这里，在我更不拘束的人群中，我发现它只是让你的脚、手和身体自然地表达出被音乐激发的冲动。
From then on, hardly a party took place without me turning up-inviting myself, if I had to-and lindy- hopping my head off. 
从那时起，几乎没有一个聚会不会出现我的身影-如果必要的话，我会自告奋勇地邀请自己-并且尽情跳林迪舞。
I'd always been fast at picking up new things. I made up for lost time now so fast that soon girlswere asking me to dance with them. I worked my partners hard; that's why they liked me somuch. 
我一向很快学会新事物。我迅速弥补了失去的时间，很快就有女孩邀请我跳舞。我努力配合我的舞伴，这就是为什么她们如此喜欢我的原因。
When I was at work, up in the Roseland men's room, I just couldn't keep still. My shine ragpopped with the rhythm of those great bands rocking the ballroom. White customers on the shinestand, especially, would laugh to see my feet suddenly break loose on their own and cut a fewsteps. Whites are correct in thinking that black people are natural dancers. Even little kids are- except for those Negroes today who are so "integrated," as I had been, that their instincts areinhibited. You know those "dancing jibagoo" toys that you windup? Well, I was like a live one- music just wou nd me up. 
当我在工作时，在玫瑰兰的男厕所里，我无法保持安静。我的鞋擦随着舞厅中那些伟大的乐队的节奏跳动。尤其是在鞋擦站上的白人客户会笑看我的脚突然自己松开并跳出几个舞步。白人认为黑人天生就是跳舞高手。甚至小孩子也是如此- 除了那些像我一样“融入”了的黑人，他们的本能被抑制了。你们知道那些可以上发条的“跳舞机器人”玩具吗？好吧，我就像一个活生生的机器人- 音乐只是把我唤醒了。
By the next dance for the Boston black folk-I remember that Lionel Hampton was coming in toplay-I had given my notice to the Roseland's manager. 
在下一场波士顿黑人民间舞蹈的表演中，我记得莱昂内尔·汉普顿要来表演-我已经向罗斯兰酒店的经理递交了辞呈。
When I told Ella why I had quit, she laughed aloud: I told her I couldn't find time to shine shoesand dance, too. She was glad, because she had never liked the idea of my working at that no- prestige job. When I told Shorty, he said he'd known I'd soon outgrow it anyway. 
当我告诉艾拉我为什么要辞职时，她大笑起来： 我告诉她我不能同时擦鞋和跳舞。她很高兴，因为她从来没有喜欢过我在那个没有声望的工作中工作的想法。当我告诉Shorty时，他说他早就知道我会很快超越它。
Shorty could dance all right himself but, for his own reasons, he never cared about going to thebig dances. He loved just the music-making end of it. He practiced his saxophone and listened torecords. It astonished me that Shorty didn't care to go and hear the big bands play. He had hisalto sax idol, Johnny Hodges, with Duke Ellington's band, but he said he thought too many youngmusicians were only carbon-copying the big-band names on the same instrument. Anyway,Shorty was really serious about nothing except his music, and about working for the day when hecould start his own little group to gig around Boston. 
Shorty自己跳舞也不错，但出于他自己的原因，他从不关心去参加大型舞会。他只喜欢音乐本身。他练习萨克斯管并听唱片。令我惊讶的是，Shorty并不想去听大乐队演奏。他有自己的萨克斯管偶像约翰尼·霍奇斯，在杜克·艾林顿的乐队中演奏，但他说他认为太多年轻的音乐家只是模仿同一种乐器上的大乐队名字。无论如何，Shorty对除了他的音乐之外的事情都非常认真，并且希望有一天能够成立自己的小乐队在波士顿演出。
The morning after I quit Roseland, I was down at the men's clothing store bright and early. Thesalesman checked and found that I'd missed only one weekly payment: I had "A-1" credit. I toldhim I'd just quit my jo b, but he said that didn't make any difference; I could miss paying them for acouple of weeks if I had to; he knew I'd get straight. 
在我辞去罗斯兰酒店的那天早晨，我很早就去了男装店。售货员检查后发现我只错过了一次每周的付款：我有“A-1”信用评级。我告诉他我刚刚辞职，但他说这没有任何区别；我可以在几个星期内不付款，如果必要的话；他知道我会还钱的。
This time, I studied carefully everything in my size on the racks. And finally I picked out mysecond zoot. It was a sharkskin gray, with a big, long coat, and pants ballooning out at the kneesand then tapering down to cuffs so narrow that I had to take off my shoes to get them on and off.With the salesman urging me on, I got another shirt, and a hat, and new shoes-the kind that werejustcoming into hipster style; dark orange colored, with paper-thin soles and knob style toes. It alladded up to seventy or eighty dollars. 
这次，我仔细地挑选了我尺寸的每件衣服。最终，我选了第二双小丑鞋。它是灰色的鲨鱼皮，有一件大而长的外套，裤子在膝盖处膨胀，然后逐渐变窄到踝部，以至于我不得不脱下鞋子才能穿上它们。在售货员的催促下，我又买了一件衬衫、一顶帽子和一双新鞋-那种刚刚进入时髦潮流的鞋子；深橙色的，有着极薄的鞋底和圆头款式的脚趾。这一切加起来大约是七十或八十美元。
It was such a red-letter day that I even went and got my first barbershop conk. This time it didn'thurt so much, just as Shorty had predicted. 
那是一个非常值得纪念的日子，我甚至去了第一次理发店理发。这一次没有像Shorty预测的那么疼，只是有些痛。
That night, I timed myself to hit Roseland as the thick of the crowd was coming in. In thethronging lobby, I saw some of the real Roxbury hipsters eyeing my zoot, and some fine womenwere giving me that look. I sauntered up to the men's room for a short drink from the pint in myinside coat-pocket. My replacement was there-a scared, narrow-faced, hungry-looking littlebrown-skinned fellow just in town from Kansas City. And when he recognized me, he couldn'tkeep down his admiration and wonder. I told nun to "keep cool," that he'd soon catch on to thehappenings. Everything felt right when I went into the ballroom. 
当晚，我在人群涌入的高峰期到达了罗斯兰酒店。在拥挤的大堂里，我看到一些真正的罗克斯伯里时髦人士盯着我的小丑鞋，还有一些漂亮的女人给了我那种眼神。我走到男洗手间里，从外套口袋里拿出一品脱啤酒喝了一口-我的替代者在那里，一个害怕、面容狭窄、饥饿的小伙子，刚刚从堪萨斯城来到镇上。当他认出我时，他忍不住表达了他的钦佩和惊奇。我告诉他要“保持冷静”，他很快就会了解到正在发生的事情。当我走进舞厅时，一切都感觉很对。
Hamp's band was working, and that big, waxed floor was packed with people lindy-hopping likecrazy. I grabbed some girl I'd never seen, and the next thing I knew we were out there Undyingaway and grinning at each other. It couldn't have been finer. 
汉普的乐队正在演奏，那个大而光亮的地板上挤满了像疯了一样跳林迪舞的人们。我抓住了一个我从未见过的女孩，接下来的事情我就知道我们在那里无尽地跳舞，互相微笑着。这不可能更好了。
I'd been Undying previously only in cramped little apartment living rooms, and now I had room tomaneuver. Once I really got myself warmed and loosened up, I was snatching partners fromamong the hundreds of unattached, free-lancing girls along the sidelines-almost every one ofthem could really dance-and I just about went wild! Hamp's band wailing. I was whirling girls sofast their skirts were snapping. Black girls, brownskins, high yellows, even a couple of the whitegirls there. Boosting them over my hips, my shoulders, into the air. Though I wasn't quite sixteenthen, I was tall and rawboned and looked like twenty-one; I was also pretty strong for my age.Circling, tap-dancing, I was underneath them when they landed-doing the "flapping eagle," "thekangaroo" and the "split." 
我之前只在狭窄的小公寓客厅里跳过舞，现在我有足够的空间移动。一旦我真正热身并放松下来，我就从数百个单身、自由职业的女孩中抢到舞伴-几乎每一个都能真正跳舞-我简直疯狂了！汉普的乐队咆哮着。我旋转着女孩们，以至于她们的裙子都快撕裂了。
After that, I never missed a Roseland lindy-hop as long as I stayed in Boston. 
在那之后，只要我留在波士顿，我就从未错过一次罗斯兰林迪舞会。
*     *     * 
The greatest lindy-dancing partner I had, everything considered, was a girl named Laura. I mether at my next job . When I quit shoeshining, Ella was so happy that she went around askingabout a job for me-one she would approve. Just two blocks from her house, the Townsend DrugStore was about to replace its soda fountain clerk, a fellow who was leaving to go off to college. 
综合考虑，我最棒的林迪舞伴是一个叫Laura的女孩。我在下一份工作中遇到了她。当我辞去擦鞋的工作时，Ella非常高兴，她到处打听是否有适合我的工作-一个她会认可的工作。从她家到Townsend药房只有两个街区，那里即将取代其制冰机职员，一个要去上大学的人。
When Ella told me, I didn't like it. She knew I couldn't stand those Hill characters. But speakingmy mind right then would have made Ella mad. I didn't want that to happen, so I put on the whitejacket and started serving up sodas, sundaes, splits, shakes and all the rest of that fountain stuffto those fancy-acting Negroes. 
当Ella告诉我时，我并不喜欢这个主意。她知道我不能忍受那些希尔族人。但当时坦率地说出自己的想法会让Ella生气。我不想发生这种情况，所以我穿上白色制服开始为这些时髦的黑人提供苏打水、冰淇淋、分裂、奶昔和其他所有喷泉食品。
Every evening when I got off at eight and came home, Ella would keep saying, "1 hope you'llmeet some of these nice young people your age here in Roxbury." But those penny-ante squareswho came in there putting on their millionaires' airs, the young ones and the old ones both, onlyannoyed me. People like the sleep-in maid for Beacon Hill white folks who used to come in withher "ooh, my deah" manners and order corn plasters in the Jew's drugstore for black folks. Or thehospital cafeteria-line serving woman sitting there on her day off with a cat fur around her neck,telling the proprietor she was a "dietitian"-both of them knowing she was lying. Even the youngones, my age, whom Ella was always talking about. The soda fountain was one of their hang- outs. They soon had me ready to quit, with their accents so phonied upthat if you just heard themand didn't see them, you wouldn't even know they were Negroes. I couldn't wait for eight o'clockto get home to eat out of those soul-food pots of Ella's, then get dressed in my zoot and head forsome of my friends' places in town, to lindy-hop and get high, or something, for relief from thoseHill clowns. 
每天晚上我八点下班回家时，Ella总是说：“我希望你能在罗克斯伯里遇到和你同龄的这些好年轻人。”但是那些穿着名牌衣服、摆出百万富翁姿态的年轻人和老年人都让我感到厌烦。像Beacon Hill白人雇佣的睡衣女佣，她带着“哦，我的天啊”的礼貌来到这里，并在犹太人药店为黑人买玉米粉。或者医院食堂里的服务员，她正值休息日，脖子上围着一条猫毛，告诉店主她是“营养学家”，但他们都知道她在撒谎。甚至像我这样年纪的年轻人也是如此，这是他们的聚会场所之一。他们很快就让我想要辞职了，他们的口音被夸大到了这种程度，如果你只听到他们的声音而不看到他们，你甚至不会知道他们是黑人。我迫不及待地想等到八点回家吃Ella做的灵肉饭菜，然后穿上我的小丑服去城里的一些朋友那里跳舞或嗑药，以此来逃避那些Hill clowns的烦恼。
Before long, I didn't see how I was going to be able to stick it out there eight hours a day; and Inearly didn't. I remember one night, I nearly quit because I had hit the numbers for ten cents-thefirst time I had ever hit-on one of the sideline bets that I'd made in the drugstore. (Yes, there wereseveral runners on the Hill; even dignified Negroes played the numbers.) I won sixty dollars, andShorty and I had a ball with it. I wished I had hit for the daily dollar that I played with my townman, paying him by the week. I would surely have quit the drugstore. I could have bought a car. 
不久之后，我发现自己每天在那里工作八小时真的很难坚持下去；而Inearly也是如此。我记得有一晚，我差点就辞职了，因为我在药店的外围赌博中第一次达到了十美分的目标(是的，山丘上有好几个人在玩数字游戏；甚至那些体面的黑人也会玩数字游戏)。我赢了60美元，Shorty和我拿着钱开心地玩了一会儿。我希望我能像和我的城里人打赌一样，赢得每日一美元的奖金，并用它支付他一个星期的工资。我肯定会辞去药店的工作。我可以买辆车了。
Anyway, Laura lived in a house that was catercorner across the street from the drugstore. After awhile, as soon as I saw her coming in, I'd start making up a banana split. She was a real bug forthem, and she came in late every afternoon-after school. I imagine I'd been shoving that icecream dish under her nose for five or six weeks before somehow it began to sink in that shewasn't like the rest. She was certainly the only Hill girl that came in there and acted in any wayfriendly and natural. 
不管怎样，Laura住在街对面的药店旁边的房子里。过了一段时间，每当我看到她进来时，我就开始做香蕉冰淇淋。她真是个有趣的人，每天下午放学后都会来晚一些。我想我可能已经在她面前塞了好几个星期的冰激凌了，才终于开始意识到她和其他人不一样。她是唯一一个来自山丘的女孩，在那里表现得友好自然。
She always had some book with her, and poring over it, she would make a thirty-minute job ofthat daily dish of banana split. I began to notice the books she read, They were pretty heavyschool stuff-Latin, algebra, things like that. Watching her made me reflect that I hadn't read evena newspaper since leaving Mason. 
她总是带着一本书，沉浸在其中，她会把每天的香蕉冰淇淋变成一项三十分钟的工作。我开始注意到她读的书，它们都是很重的学校教材-拉丁语、代数等等。看着她让我反思，自从离开梅森以来，我甚至没有读过一份报纸。
_Laura_. I heard her name called by a few of the others who came in when she was there. But Icould see they didn't know her too well; they said "hello"-thatwas about the extent of it. She keptto herself, and she never said more than "Thank you"' to me. Nice voice. Soft. Quiet. Neveranother word. But no airs like the others, no black Bostonese. She was just herself. 
翻译：Laura。我听到一些人在她来的时候叫她的名字，但我看得出他们并不太了解她；他们只是说“你好”，仅此而已。她一直保持着沉默，从未对我说过更多的话。她的声音很柔和、安静，从未说过其他的话。但她没有像其他人那样摆出架子，也没有黑帮口音。她只是做自己。
I liked that. Before too long, I struck up a conversation. Just what subject I got off on I don'tremember, but she readily opened up and began talking, and she was very friendly. I found outthat she was a high school junior, an honor student. Her parents had split up when she was ababy, and she had been raised by her grandmother, an old lady on a pension, who was very strictand old-fashioned and religious, Laura had just one close friend, a girl who lived over inCambridge, whom she had gone to school with. They talked on the telephone every day. Hergrandmother scarcely ever let her go to the movies, let alone on dates. 
我很喜欢她这样。不久之后，我开始和她聊天。我不记得我们聊了什么话题，但她很乐意和我交流，而且非常友好。我发现她是一名高中二年级的学生，是一个优秀的学生。她的父母在她还是个婴儿的时候就分开了，她被祖母抚养长大，这位老奶奶领取退休金，非常严格、守旧和虔诚。Laura只有一个亲密的朋友，一个住在剑桥的女孩，她们一起上学。她们每天都会通电话。她的祖母几乎不让她去看电影，更不用说约会了。
But Laura really liked school. She said she wanted to go on to college. She was keen for algebra,and she planned to major in science. Laura never would have dreamed that she was a year olderthan I was. I gauged that indirectly. She looked up to me as though she felt I had a world ofexperience more than she did-which really was the truth. But sometimes, when she had gone, Ifelt let down, thinking how I had turned away from the books I used to like when I was back inMichigan. 
但Laura真的很喜欢学校。她说她想上大学，对代数很感兴趣，计划主修科学。我估计她比我大一岁，这是间接的推断。她好像把我当成一个有经验的人一样看待，其实我的确比她更有经验。但有时候，当她走了之后，我会感到有些失落，想到自己在回到密歇根州后放弃了以前喜欢的书本。
I got to the point where I looked forward to her coming in every day after school. I stopped lettingher pay, and gave her extra ice cream. And she wasn't hiding the fact that she liked me. 
我开始期待每天放学后她来店里。我不再让她付钱，还给了她额外的冰淇淋。而她也不再掩饰她对我的好感。
It wasn't long before she had stopped reading her books when she came in, and would just sitand eat and talk with me. And soon she began trying to get me to talk about myself. I wasimmediately sorry when I dropped that I had once thought about becoming a lawyer. She didn'twant to let me rest about that. "Malcolm, there's no reason you can't pick up right where you areand become alawyer." She had the idea that my sister Ella would help me as much as she could.And if Ella had ever thought that she could help any member of the Little family put up any kind ofprofessional shingle-as a teacher, a foot-doctor, anything-why, you would have had to tie herdown to keep her from taking in washing. 
不久后，她来店里的时候不再看书了，只是坐着吃东西和我聊天。很快她开始试图让我谈论自己。当我不小心透露曾经想过成为一名律师时，我立刻感到很抱歉。但她并不想就此罢休：“Malcolm,你没有任何理由不能继续前进，成为一名律师。”她认为我的姐姐Ella会尽可能地帮助我。如果Ella曾经认为她可以帮助Little家族中的任何一个成员打理任何类型的专业业务-比如当老师、足科医生等等-那么你必须绑住她，不让她去洗衣服。
I never mentioned Laura to Shorty. I just knew she never would have understood him, or thatcrowd. And they wouldn't have understood her. She had never been touched, I'm certain shehadn't, or even had a drink, and she wouldn't even have known what a reefer was. 
我从来没有向Shorty提起过Laura。
It was a great surprise to me when one afternoon Laura happened to let drop that she "just loved"lindy-hopping. I asked her how had she been able to go out dancing. She said she'd beenintroduced to lindy-hopping at a party given by the parents of some Negro friend just accepted byHarvard. 
我非常惊讶，有一天下午Laura无意中透露她“很喜欢”跳林迪舞。我问她如何能够出去跳舞，她说她在一次由一位黑人朋友的朋友举办的派对上被介绍给林迪舞，然后就喜欢上了它。
It was just about time to start closing down the soda fountain, and I said that Count Basie wasplaying the Roseland that weekend, and would she like to go? 
快到关门的时间了，我问她是否有兴趣去看 Count Basie 在 Roseland 的演出，她是否愿意去？
Laura's eyes got wide. I thought I'd have to catch her, she was so excited. She said she'd neverbeen there, she'd heard so much about it, she'd imagined what it was like, she'd just giveanything-but her grandma would have a fit. 
Laura的眼睛瞪大了，我以为我得抓住她，她太兴奋了。她说她从来没去过那里，她听说过很多关于它的事情，她想象着那里是什么样的，但她的祖母会生气的。
So I said maybe some other time. 
所以我说或许改天吧。
But the afternoon before the dance, Laura came in full of excitement. She whispered that she'dnever lied to her grandma before, but she had told her she had to attend some school functionthat evening. If I'd get her home early, she'd meet me-if I'd still take her. 
但在舞会前一天的下午，Laura充满兴奋地进来了。她低声说她以前从来没有对奶奶撒过谎，但她告诉奶奶今晚要参加学校的活动，如果我能早点带她回家，她愿意和我见面-如果我还愿意带她去的话。
  I told her we'd have to go by for me to change clothes at the house. She hesitated, but said okay.Before we left, I telephoned Ella to say I'd be bringing a girl by on the way to the dance. ThoughI'd never before done anything like it, Ella covered up her surprise. 
我告诉她我们必须先去我家换衣服。她犹豫了一下，但还是同意了。在我们离开之前，我给Ella打了电话，说我会在去舞会的路上带一个女孩来。虽然我以前从来没有做过这样的事情，但Ella掩饰住了她的惊讶。
I laughed to myself a long time afterward about how Ella's mouth flew open when we showed upat the front door-me and a well-bred Hill girl. Laura, when I introduced her, was warm and sincere.And Ella, you would have thought she was closing in on her third husband. 
事后我笑了很久，想起当我们出现在门口时Ella张大了嘴巴-我和一个受过良好教育的山丘女孩。当我介绍Laura时，她热情而真诚。而Ella,你会以为她正在接近她的第三个丈夫。
While they sat and talked downstairs, I dressed upstairs in my room. I remember changing mymind about the wild sharkskin gray zoot I had planned to wear, and deciding instead to put on thefirst one I'd gotten, the blue zoot. I knew I should wear the most conservative thing I had. 
当他们在楼下坐着聊天时，我在楼上的房间里换衣服。我记得改变了我对野鲨鱼皮灰色小丑服的想法，决定穿上我第一次得到的蓝色小丑服。我知道我应该穿最保守的衣服。
They were like old friends when I came back down. Ella had even made tea. Ella's hawk-eye justabout raked my zoot right off my back. But I'm sure she was grateful that I'd at least put on theblue one. Knowing Ella, I knew that she had already extracted Laura's entire life story-and all buthad the wedding bells around my neck. I grinned all the way to the Roseland in the taxi, becauseI had showed Ella I could hang out with Hill girls if I wanted to. 
当我走下楼时，他们就像老朋友一样。Ella甚至已经准备好了茶。Ella的鹰眼几乎把我的小丑服从背上扯了下来。但我相信她至少穿上了蓝色的小丑服是感激的。我知道Ella已经把Laura的整个故事都讲给我听了-而且几乎已经为我戴上了结婚戒指。我在出租车上一直笑，因为我向Ella证明我可以和山丘女孩一起出去玩。
Laura's eyes were so big. She said almost none of her acquaintances knew her grandmother,who never went anywhere but to church, so there wasn't much danger of it getting back to her.The only person she had told was her girl friend, who had shared her excitement. 
Laura的眼睛睁得很大。她说几乎没有她认识的人知道她的祖母，她只去教堂，所以没有什么危险会传到她那里。唯一一个告诉过的人是她的女朋友，她也分享了她的兴奋。
Then, suddenly, we were in the Roseland's jostling lobby. And I was getting waves and smilesand greetings. They shouted "My man!" and "Hey, Red!" and I answered "Daddy-o." 
突然间，我们来到了 Roseland 的拥挤大堂。我感受到了人群中的波浪、微笑和问候。他们喊着“我的人！”和“嘿，Red!”，而我回答着“爹地-O”。
 She and I never before had danced together, but that certainly was no problem. Any two peoplewho can lindy at all can lindy together. We just started out there on the floor among a lot of othercouples. 
她和我以前从未一起跳舞过，但这显然不是问题。任何两个人只要会跳林迪舞，就可以一起跳。我们只是开始在许多其他舞伴中跳舞。
It was maybe halfway in the number before I became aware of how she danced. 
可能是在跳舞的队伍中走到一半的时候，我才意识到她的舞姿。
*     *     * 
If you've ever lindy-hopped, you'll know what I'm talking about. With most girls, you kind of workopposite them, circling, side-stepping, leading. Whichever arm you lead with is half-bent outthere, your hands are giving that little pull, that little push, touching her waist, her shoulders, herarms. She's in, out, turning, whirling, wherever you guide her. With poor partners, you feel theirweight. They're slow and heavy. But with really good partners, all you need is just the push-pullsuggestion. They guide nearly effortlessly, even off the floor and into the air, and your little solomaneuver is done on the floor before they land, when they join you, whirling, right in step. 
如果你曾经跳过林迪舞，你就会知道我在说什么。和大多数女孩跳舞时，你需要和她们相反地工作，转圈、侧步、领舞。无论你用哪只手臂领舞，那只手臂都会半弯曲在外面，你的手会给予一些轻微的拉扯和推进，触碰她的腰、肩膀和手臂。她会随着你的引导进入、退出、转动、旋转，无论你引导她去哪里。与技术较差的搭档一起跳舞时，你会感受到他们的重量。他们动作缓慢而笨重。但与真正的好搭档一起跳舞时，你只需要给出一些推拉的建议。他们几乎可以毫不费力地引导舞蹈，甚至在落地之前就已经飞起来，当你完成自己的独舞时，他们加入你，旋转着和你保持同步。
I'd danced with plenty of good partners. But what I became suddenly aware of with Laura wasthat I'd never before felt so little weight! I'd nearly just _think_ a maneuver, and she'd respond. 
我曾经和很多好的搭档跳过舞。但突然间，我意识到和Laura跳舞时，我从来没有感受过那么轻盈的重量！我几乎只需要想到一个动作，她就会做出反应。
Anyway, as she danced up, down, under my arm, flinging out, while I felt her out and examinedher style, I glimpsed her footwork. I can close my eyes right now and see it, like some blurringballet-beautiful! And her lightness, like a shadow! My perfect partner, if somebody had asked me,would have been one who handled as lightly as Laura and who would have had the strength tolast through a long, tough showtime. But I knew that Laura wouldn't begin to be that strong. 
不管怎样，当她在我身边跳舞时，我感觉到她的舞步轻盈自如。我可以闭上眼睛，想象她的舞步，就像优美的芭蕾舞一样！她的轻盈就像一个阴影！如果我要找一个完美的搭档，那么这个人应该像Laura一样轻盈，同时也要有足够的力量来度过漫长而艰难的表演时间。但我知道Laura不会变得那么强壮。
In Harlem, years later, a friend of mine called "Sammy The Pimp" taught mesomething I wish Ihad known then to look for in Laura's face. It was what Sammy declared was his infallible clue fordetermining the "unconscious, true personality" of women. Considering all the women he hadpicked out of crowds and turned into prostitutes, Sammy qualified as an expert. Anyway, heswore that if a woman, any woman, gets really carried away while dancing, what she truly is-atleast potentially-will surface and show on her face. 
几年后，我在哈莱姆的一个朋友“Sammy The Pimp”教我了一件我希望当时就知道的事情，就是去寻找Laura脸上的线索。Sammy宣称这是他判断女性“潜意识真实个性”的无懈可击的方法。考虑到他在人群中挑选出的所有女人，并将她们变成妓女，Sammy有资格成为一个专家。不管怎样，他发誓说如果一个女人，任何一个女人在跳舞时非常兴奋，那么她真正的本质-至少潜在的-就会在她的脸上显露出来。
I'm not suggesting that a lady-of-easy-virtue look danced to the surface in Laura-although life diddeal her cruel blows, starting with her meeting me. All I am saying is that it may be that if I hadbeen equipped with Sammy's ability, I might have spotted in Laura then some of the subsurfacepotential, destined to become real, that would have shocked her grandma. 
我不是说Laura的放荡外表在跳舞时显露出来，尽管她的生活给了她残酷的打击，从我们相遇开始。我只是说如果我有Sammy的能力，我可能会在Laura的脸上发现一些潜在的表面特征，注定会变成现实，这可能会让她的祖母感到震惊。
A third of the way or so through the evening the main vocalizing and instrumental stylings wouldcome-and then showtime, when only the greatest lindy-hoppers would stay on the floor, to try andeliminate each other. All the other dancers would form a big "U" with the band at the open end. 
到了晚上的三分之一左右，主要的歌唱和乐器风格就会开始出现，然后是表演时间，当时只有最棒的林迪舞者会留在地板上，试图互相消除。所有其他的舞者都会在乐队打开的一端形成一个大“U”形。
The girls who intended to compete would slip over to the sidelines and change from high heelsinto low white sneakers. In competition, they never could survive in heels. And always amongthem were four or five unattached girls who would run around trying to hook up with some guythey knew could really lindy. 
那些打算参加比赛的女孩会悄悄地走到场边，把高跟鞋换成低帮白色运动鞋。在比赛中，她们永远不能穿高跟鞋。而且总是有四五个单身女孩在周围跑来跑去，试图和某个他们认识的可以真正跳林迪舞的人搭讪。
Now Count Basie turned on the showtime blast, and the other dancers moved off the floor,shifting for good watching positions, and began their hollering for their favorites. "All right now,Red!" they shouted to me, "Go get 'em, Red." And then a free-lancing lindy-girl I'd danced withbefore, Mamie Bevels, a waitress and a wild dancer, ran up to me, with Laura standing rightthere. I wasn't sure what to do. But Laura started backing away toward the crowd, still looking atme.The Count's band was wailing. I grabbed Mamie and we started to work. She was a big, rough,strong gal, and she lindied like a bucking horse. I remember the very night that she becameknown as one of the showtime favorites there at the Roseland. A band was screaming when shekicked off her shoes and got barefooted, and shouted, and shook herself as if she were in someAfrican jungle frenzy, and then she let loose with some dancing, shouting with every step, untilthe guy that was out there with her nearly had to fight to control her. The crowd loved any way-outlindying style that made a colorful show like that. It was how Mamie had become known. 
现在，百爵士开始播放表演时间的乐曲，其他舞者离开了地板，寻找观看位置。他们开始为自己喜欢的人欢呼。“好了，Red!”他们对我喊道，“去追她们，Red。”然后，我之前和一个自由职业的林迪舞女孩Mamie Bevels跳过舞，她是一名服务员和狂野的舞者，跑到了我身边，Laura也站在那里。我不知道该怎么办。但Laura开始向人群退去，仍然看着我。百爵士乐队在尖叫着。我抓住了Mamie,我们开始跳舞。她是一个高大、粗壮、强壮的女孩，她的林迪舞像一匹脱缰的野马一样。我记得那个晚上，她被称为Roseland表演时间的最爱之一。当她脱下鞋子赤脚跳舞时，乐队尖叫着，她摇晃着自己的身体，仿佛置身于非洲丛林的狂乱之中。然后她放开了舞蹈，每走一步就大声喊叫，直到和她在现场的那个家伙不得不控制她。观众喜欢任何与众不同的林迪舞风格，这使得表演变得如此丰富多彩。这就是Mamie成为众人喜爱的原因。
Anyway, I started driving her like a horse, the way she liked. When we came off the floor after thefirst number, we both were wringing wet with sweat, and people were shouting and pounding ourbacks. 
无论如何，我开始像马一样驾驭她，这是她喜欢的方式。当我们在第一支舞结束后下了场时，我们都浑身是汗，人们喊叫着拍打我们的背。
I remember leaving early with Laura, to get her home in time. She was very quiet. And she didn'thave much to say for the next week or so when she came into the drugstore. Even then, I hadlearned enough about women to know not to pressure them when they're thinking something out;they'll tell you when they're ready. 
我记得那天早早地和Laura离开了，以确保她能及时回家。她非常沉默。在接下来的几周里，当她走进药店时，她也没什么可说的。即使如此，我已经学到了很多关于女性的知识，知道在她们思考某件事情的时候不要施加压力；等到她们准备好了，自然会告诉你。
Every time I saw Ella, even brushing my teeth in the morning, she turned on the third degree.When was I seeing Laura again? Was I going to bring her by again? "What a nice girl she is!" Ellahad picked her out for me. 
每次我看到Ella,即使是在早上刷牙的时候，她都会对我发火。我什么时候再看到Laura呢？我是要再次带她来吗？“她真是个好姑娘！” Ella为我挑选了她。
But in that kind of way, I thought hardly anything about the girl. When it came to personal matters,my mind was strictly on getting "sharp" in my zoot as soon as I left work, and racing downtown tohang out with Shorty and the other guys-and with the girls they knew-a million miles away fromthe stuck-up Hill. 
但在这种情况下，我几乎不去想那个女孩。当涉及到个人问题时，我的心思完全是在我一下班就变得“敏锐”起来，然后跑到市中心去和矮子和其他人—还有他们认识的女孩们—一起玩—在离高脚山一百万英里的地方。
  I wasn't even thinking about Laura when she came up to me in the drugstore and asked me totake her to the next Negro dance at the Roseland. Duke Ellington was going to play, and she wasbeside herself with excitement. I had no way to know what was going to happen. 
当Laura在药店里找到我，请我带她去Roseland的下一个黑人舞会时，我甚至没有考虑过她。杜克·艾灵顿将要演奏，她兴奋不已。我不知道接下来会发生什么。
She asked me to pick her up at her house this time. I didn't want any contact with the oldgrandma she had described, but I went. Grandma answered the door-an old-fashioned, wrinkledblack woman, with fuzzy gray hair. She just o pened the door enough for me to get in, not evensaying as much as "Come in, dog." I've faced armed detectives and gangsters less hostile thanshe was. 
她这次要求我在她的家里接她。我不想和那个她描述的老奶奶有任何接触，但我还是去了。老奶奶是一个年迈的、皱纹纵横的黑人妇女，头发是灰色的。她只是打开了门让我进去，甚至没有说“进来吧，狗”。我面对武装侦探和黑帮分子时都没有这么敌对过她。
I remember the musty living room, full of those old Christ pictures, prayers woven into tapestries,statuettes of the crucifixion, other religious objects on the mantel, shelves, table tops, walls,everywhere. 
我记得那个发霉的客厅，到处都是那些古老的基督画像、编织在挂毯上的祈祷、耶稣受难的雕像和其他宗教物品，壁炉架、书架、桌面和墙壁上都有。
Since the old lady wasn't speaking to me, I didn't speak to her, either. I completely sympathizewith her now, of course. 
由于老奶奶没有和我说话，我也没有和她说话。当然，我现在完全同情她了。
What could she have thought of me in my zoot and conk and orange shoes? She'd have done usall a favor if she had run screaming for the police. If something looking as I did then ever cameknocking at my door today, asking to see one of my four daughters, I know I would explode. 
她当时怎么看我呢？穿着花哨的衣服，戴着圆顶帽和橙色鞋子。如果她当时尖叫着跑去报警就好了。如果今天有人像我这样敲门，问我要见我的四个女儿中的一个，我知道我会爆炸的。
When Laura rushed into the room, jerking on her coat, I could see that she was upset and angryand embarrassed. And in the taxi, she started crying. She had hated herself for lying before; shehad decided to tell the truth about where she was going, and there had been a screaming battlewith grandma. Laura had told the old lady that she was going to start going out when and whereshe wanted to, or she would quit school and get a job and move out on her own-and her grandmahad pitched a fit. Laura just walked out. 
当Laura冲进房间，拉扯着自己的外套时，我能看出她很生气、很沮丧和尴尬。在出租车上，她开始哭泣。她因为之前撒谎而讨厌自己；她决定告诉真相，但和奶奶发生了一场激烈的争吵。Laura告诉奶奶，她想什么时候去哪里就去哪里，否则她会退学找工作搬出去独自生活-她的奶奶大发雷霆。Laura只是走了出去。
 When we got to the Roseland, we danced the early part of the evening with each other and withdifferent partners. And finally the Duke kicked off showtime. 
当我们到达Roseland时，我们和不同的舞伴一起跳了晚会的前几个部分。最后，杜克开始了表演时间。
I knew, and Laura knew, that she couldn't match the veteran showtime girls, but she told me thatshe wanted to compete. And the next thing I knew, she was among those girls over on thesidelines changing into sneakers. I shook my head when a couple of the free-lancing girls ran upto me. 
我知道，Laura也知道，她无法与那些经验丰富的表演时间女孩竞争，但她告诉我她想参加比赛。接下来的事情我都知道，她和其他女孩一起在边上换上运动鞋。当几个自由职业的女孩跑来找我时，我摇了摇头。
As always, the crowd clapped and shouted in time with the blasting band. "Go, Red, go!" Partly itwas my reputation, and partly Laura's ballet style of dancing that helped to turn the spotlight-andthe crowd's attention-to us. They never had seen the feather-lightness that she gave to Undying,a completely fresh style-and they were connoisseurs of styles. I turned up the steam, Laura's feetwere flying; I had her in the air, down, sideways, around; backwards, up again, down, whirling . . .. 
和往常一样，人群在乐队的轰鸣声中鼓掌欢呼。“加油，红队！加油！”这部分是因为我的名声，也部分是因为Laura的芭蕾舞风格帮助我们吸引了聚光灯和观众的注意力。他们从来没有见过她给Undying带来的轻盈感，一种完全新颖的风格-他们是风格的鉴赏家。我打开了蒸汽阀，Laura的脚像飞一样；我让她在空中飞行、倒下、侧滑、绕圈、向后、再起飞、再倒下、旋转......
The spotlight was working mostly just us. I caught glimpses of the four or five other couples, thegirls jungle-strong, animal-like, bucking and charging. But little Laura inspired me to drive to newheights. Her hair was all over her face, it was running sweat, and I couldn't believe her strength.The crowd was shouting and stomping. A new favorite was being discovered; there was a wall ofnoise around us. I felt her weakening, she was lindying like a fighter out on her feet, and westumbled off to the sidelines. The band was still blasting. I had to half-carry her; she was gaspingfor air. Some of the men in the band applauded. 
聚光灯主要照在我们身上。我瞥见了其他四五对舞伴，女孩们像丛林一样强壮，像动物一样野性十足，跳跃着、冲撞着。但小Laura激发了我追求新高度的动力。她的头发遮住了脸颊，满头大汗，我无法相信她的力量。观众在欢呼和跺脚，我们被当作新的宠儿；周围一片嘈杂声。我感到她越来越虚弱，她像个倒下的斗士一样摇晃着，跌倒在边上。乐队仍在轰鸣。我只能半抱着她；她喘不过气来。乐队里的一些男人鼓掌。
And even Duke Ellington half raised up from his piano stool and bowed. 
甚至连杜克·艾灵顿也从钢琴凳上半站起来向我们鞠躬。
If a showtime crowd liked your performance, when you came off you were mobbed, mauled,grasped, and pummeled like the team that's just taken theseries. One bunch of the crowdswarmed Laura; they had her clear up off her feet. And I was being pounded on the back. . . whenI caught this fine blonde's eyes. . . . This one I'd never seen among the white girls who came tothe Roseland black dances. She was eyeing me levelly. 
如果表演时间的观众喜欢你的表演，当你下台时，你会像刚刚赢得系列赛的球队一样被人群包围、攻击、抓住和殴打。其中一群人围着Laura;他们把她从地上扶起来。而我正被人拍打背部......当我看到这位漂亮的金发女孩的眼睛时......这个女孩我从未在来Roseland黑人舞蹈会的白人女孩中见过。她直视着我。
Now at that time, in Roxbury, in any black ghetto in America, to have a white woman who wasn't aknown, common whore was-for the average black man, at least-a status symbol of the first order.And this one, standing there, eyeing me, was almost too fine to believe. Shoulder-length hair, wellbuilt, and her clothes had cost somebody plenty. 
当时在罗克斯伯里，在美国任何黑人贫民区，有一个不知名的白人女人-对于普通黑人来说，至少是一个第一等地位的象征。而她站在那里，凝视着我，几乎难以置信。她的肩膀长度的头发，身材健美，而且她的服装花了不少钱。
It's shameful to admit, but I had just about forgotten Laura when she got loose from the mob andrushed up, big-eyed-and stopped. I guess she saw what there was to see in that girl's face-andmine-as we moved out to dance. 
难以启齿，但我几乎已经忘记了Laura,当她从人群中挣脱出来，大眼睛地跑向我时停了下来。我想她看到了那个女孩脸上和我们一起跳舞时我脸上的表情。
I'm going to call her Sophia. 
我想叫她索菲亚。
She didn't dance well, at least not by Negro standards. But who cared? I could feel the staringeyes of other couples around us. We talked. I told her she was a good dancer, and asked herwhere she'd learned. I was trying to find out why she was there. Most white women came to theblack dances for reasons I knew, but you seldom saw her kind around there. 
她的舞蹈并不好，至少不符合黑人标准。但谁在乎呢？我可以感觉到周围其他舞伴的目光。我们聊天了。我告诉她她是一个好的舞者，并问她在哪里学的。我是想找出她为什么来这里的原因。大多数白人女性来参加黑人舞蹈会都有自己的原因，但你很少在那个地方看到像她这样的女孩。
She had vague answers for everything. But in the space of that dance, we agreed that I would getLaura home early and rush back in a taxicab. And then she asked if I'd like to go for a drive later. Ifelt very lucky. 
她对所有问题都含糊其辞。但是在那场舞蹈中，我们一致认为我会早点带Laura回家，然后坐出租车回来。然后她问我是否愿意晚点再出去兜风。感觉很幸运。
Laura was home and I was back at the Roseland in an hour flat. Sophia was waiting outside. 
Laura已经回家了，我在一个小时内回到了Roseland。Sophia在外面等着我。
About five blocks down, she had a low convertible. She knew where she wasgoing. BeyondBoston, she pulled off into a side road, and then off that into a deserted lane. And turned offeverything but the radio. 
大约五个街区后，她开着一辆低矮的敞篷车。她知道自己要去哪里。出了波士顿，她把车开到了一条小路上，然后又从那里转入一条荒凉的小巷里。只打开了收音机。
*     *     * 
For the next several months, Sophia would pick me up downtown, and I'd take her to dances, andto the bars around Roxbury. We drove all over. Sometimes it would be nearly daylight when shelet me out in front of Ella's. 
在接下来的几个月里，Sophia会到市中心接我，我会带她去参加各种舞蹈和Roxbury周围的酒吧活动。我们到处开车。有时候当她让我在Ella家门口下车时，天已经快亮了。
I paraded her. The Negro men loved her. And she just seemed to love all Negroes. Two or threenights a week, we would go out together. Sophia admitted that she also had dates with whitefellows, "just for the looks of things," she said. She swore that a white man couldn't interest her. 
我炫耀她。黑人男子们都喜欢她。而她似乎也喜欢所有的黑人。两三个晚上，我们会一起出去。Sophia承认她也有和白人约会，“只是为了外表”，她说。她发誓说白人对她没有兴趣。
I wondered for a long time, but I never did find out why she approached me so boldly that veryfirst night. I always thought it was because of some earlier experience with another Negro, but Inever asked, and she never said. Never ask a woman about other men. Either she'll tell you a lie,and you still won't know, or if she tells you the truth, you might not have wanted to hear it in thefirst place. 
我花了很长时间才弄清楚，但我从未找到她第一天晚上为什么这么大胆地接近我。我一直以为是因为之前和另一个黑人的经历，但我从来没有问过，她也从来没有说过。不要问一个女人关于其他男人的事情。要么她会说谎，即使你知道了真相，也可能一开始就不想听。
Anyway, she seemed entranced with me. I began to see less of Shorty. When I did see him andthe gang, he would gibe, "Man, I had to comb the burrs out of my homeboy's head, and now he'sgot a Beacon Hill chick." But truly, because it was known that Shorty had "schooled" me, myhaving Sophia gave Shorty status. When I introduced her to him, she hugged him like a sister,and it just about finished Shorty off. His best had been white prostitutes and a few of those poorspecimens that worked around in the mills and had "discovered" Negroes. 
不管怎样，她似乎着迷于我。我开始更少地看到Shorty。当我再次见到他和他的同伴时，他会嘲笑说：“天啊，我得把这个黑人小伙子头上的杂草梳掉，现在他有了Beacon Hill女孩。”但实际上，由于众所周知Shorty“教育”过我，我有Sophia让他感到了地位。当我向他介绍她时，她像姐姐一样拥抱了他，这几乎让Shorty无法承受。他的最好伴侣是白人妓女和一些在工厂里工作并“发现”黑人的可怜的标本。
It was when I began to be seen around town with Sophia that I really began tomature into somereal status in black downtown Roxbury. Up to then I had been just another among all of theconked and zooted youngsters. But now, with the best-looking white woman who ever walked inthose bars and clubs, and with her giving me the money I spent, too, even the big, importantblack hustlers and "smart boys"-the club managers, name gamblers, numbers bankers, andothers-were clapping me on the back, setting us up to drinks at special tables, and calling me"Red." Of course I knew their reason like I knew my own name: they wanted to steal my fine whitewoman away from me . 
当我开始在镇上与Sophia一起出现时，我真正开始在黑人居住的罗克威治市中心获得一些真正的地位。到那时为止，我只是众多被打击和纵欲的年轻人之一。但现在，有了这个从未在酒吧和俱乐部中露面的最美的白人女孩，她还给了我花销，甚至那些大而重要的黑帮头目、聪明的男孩——俱乐部经理、赌博者、银行家和其他人都拍着我的背，让我们坐在特别的桌子前喝酒，并称呼我为“Red”。当然，我知道他们这样做的原因就像我知道我的名字一样：他们想从我这里抢走我的漂亮白人女友。
In the ghetto, as in suburbia, it's the same status struggle to stand out in some envied way fromthe rest. At sixteen, I didn't have the money to buy a Cadillac, but she had her own fine "rubber,"as we called a car hi those days. And I had her, which was even better. 
在贫民窟，就像在郊区一样，要在某种羡慕的方式上与其他人区别开来，这是同样的社会地位斗争。我十六岁的时候没有钱买一辆凯迪拉克(Cadillac),但她有她自己的漂亮“橡胶车”(rubber car),这是我们当时对汽车的称呼。而我有了她，这甚至更好。
Laura never again came to the drugstore as long as I continued to work there. The next time Isaw her, she was a wreck of a woman, notorious around black Roxbury, in and out of jail. Shehad finished high school, but by then she was already going the wrong way. Defying hergrandmother, she had started going out late and drinking liquor. This led to dope, and that toselling herself to men. Learning to hate the men who bought her, she also became a Lesbian.One of the shames I have carried for years is that I blame myself for all of this. To have treatedher as I did for a white woman made the blow doubly heavy. The only excuse I can offer is thatlike so many of my black brothers today, I was just deaf, dumb, and blind. 
劳拉再也没有来过药房，只要我继续在那里工作。下一次我看到她的时候，她已经是一个名声狼藉的女人，在黑人罗克威治的贫民窟里进进出出监狱。她已经完成了高中学业，但那时她已经走上了错误的道路。不听祖母的劝告，她开始晚归和饮酒。这导致了她吸毒，然后又变成了卖淫女。学会了讨厌那些买她的男人，她也变成了女同性恋。多年来我一直感到羞愧的是，我把这一切归咎于自己。因为我像对待一个白人女人那样对待她，这让我受到了双重打击。我能给出的唯一借口是，就像今天的许多黑人兄弟一样，我只是耳聋、口哑、目盲。
In any case, it wasn't long after I met Sophia that Ella found out about it, and watching from thewindows one early morning, saw me getting out of Sophia's car. Not surprisingly, Ella begantreating me like a viper. 
无论如何，我在遇见索菲亚后不久，埃拉就发现了这件事。一天清晨，她从窗户里看到我走出了索菲亚的车。毫不奇怪，埃拉开始像毒蛇一样对待我。
About then, Shorty's cousin finally moved in with the woman he was so crazy about, and Sophiafinanced me to take over half of the apartment withShorty-and I quit the drugstore and soon foundanew job. 
大约在那时，Shorty的表亲终于搬进了他如此迷恋的女人的房子里，而索菲亚资助我与Shorty一起住进了一半的公寓-我辞去了药房的工作，很快就找到了一份新工作。
I became a busboy at the Parker House in Boston. I wore a starched white jacket out in the diningroom, where the waiters would put the customers' dirty plates and silver on big aluminum trayswhich I would take back to the kitchen's dishwashers. 
我在波士顿的Parker House当了一名服务员。我穿着一件熨烫过的白色夹克，在餐厅里忙碌着，服务员们把顾客用过的脏盘子和银餐具放在大铝盘子里，然后我把它们拿回厨房的洗碗机里清洗。
A few weeks later, one Sunday morning, I ran in to work expecting to get fired, I was so late. Butthe whole kitchen crew was too excited and upset to notice: Japanese planes had just bombed aplace called Pearl Harbor. 
几个星期后的一个周日早晨，我急匆匆地跑进工作场所，以为自己会被解雇，因为我迟到了。但整个厨房的工作人员都很兴奋和难过，没有注意到：日本飞机刚刚轰炸了一个叫做珍珠港的地方。
CHAPTER FIVE 
第五章
HARLEMITE 
哈莱姆区(Harlemite)
"Get'cha goood haaaaam an' cheeeeese . . . sandwiches! Coffee! Candy! Cake! Ice Cream!"Rocking along the tracks every other day for four hours between Boston and New York in thecoach aisles of the New York, New Haven & Hartford's "Yankee Clipper." 
“来，吃点好吃的汉堡和奶酪三明治！咖啡！糖果！蛋糕！冰淇淋！”在纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德的“扬基快艇”上，每隔四个小时，我就会在波士顿和纽约之间的火车通道里摇滚着。
Old Man Rountree, an elderly Pullman porter and a friend of Elk's, had recommended the railroadjob for me. He had told her the war was snatching away railroad men so fast that if I could passfor twenty-one, he could get me on. 
老罗恩崔利是一位老年的普尔曼搬运工，也是埃尔克的朋友，他向我推荐了这份铁路工作。他告诉我战争正在迅速地抢走铁路工人的生命，如果我能通过21岁的年龄检查，他就能帮我得到这份工作。
Ella wanted to get me out of Boston and away from Sophia. She would have loved nothing betterthan to have seen me like one of those Negroes who were already thronging Roxbury in theArmy's khaki and thick shoes-home on leave from boot camp. But my age of sixteen stopped that. 
埃拉想把我从波士顿带出来，远离索菲亚。她最希望看到的就是我像那些已经在罗克斯伯里挤满穿军装的卡其色鞋子的黑人一样-从新兵训练营休假回家。但我16岁的身份阻止了这一切。
I went along with the railroad job for my own reasons. For a long time I'dwanted to visit New YorkCity. Since I had been in Roxbury, I had heard a lot about "the Big Apple," as it was called by thewell-traveled musicians, merchant mariners, salesmen, chauffeurs for white families, and variouskinds of hustlers I ran into. Even as far back as Lansing, I had been hearing about how fabulousNew York was, and especially Harlem. In fact, my father had described Harlem with pride, andshowed us pictures of the huge parades by the Harlem followers of Marcus Garvey. And everytime Joe Louis won a fight against a white opponent, big front-page pictures in the Negronewspapers such as the _Chicago Defender_, the _Pittsburgh Courier_, and the _Afro- American_ showed a sea of Harlem Negroes cheering and waving and the Brown Bomberwaving back at them from the balcony of Harlem's Theresa Hotel. Everything I'd ever heard aboutNew York City was exciting-things like Broadway's bright lights and the Savoy Ballroom andApollo Theater in Harlem, where great bands played and famous songs and dance steps andNegro stars originated. 
我出于自己的理由接受了这份铁路工作。很长一段时间以来，我一直想参观纽约市。自从我在罗克斯伯里之后，我就听说过很多关于“大苹果”的事情，这是那些经验丰富的音乐家、海员、销售员、为白人家庭开车的司机和各种各样我遇到的皮条客所称呼的。甚至早在兰辛，我就听说了纽约有多么美好，尤其是哈莱姆区。事实上，我父亲以自豪的态度描述了哈莱姆区，并向我们展示了Marcus Garvey的哈莱姆追随者参加的大型游行的照片。每当乔·路易斯打败一个白人对手时，像《芝加哥卫报》、《匹兹堡信使报》和《非裔美国人报》这样的黑人报纸都会刊登头版照片，展示着哈莱姆区的黑人欢呼雀跃、挥手致意，而布朗轰炸机则从哈莱姆的Theresa酒店阳台上向他们挥手。我对纽约市的所有听说都是令人兴奋的-比如百老汇的明亮灯光和萨沃伊舞厅以及在哈莱姆区的阿波罗剧院，那里有伟大的乐队演奏、著名的歌曲和舞蹈步骤以及黑人明星的诞生地。
But you couldn't just pick up and go to visit New York from Lansing, or Boston, or anywhere else- not without money. So I'd never really given too much thought to getting to New York until the freeway to travel there came in the form of Ella's talk with old man Rountree, who was a member ofElla's church. 
但是你不能在离开兰辛、波士顿或其他地方时直接去参观纽约-没有钱是不行的。所以我之前从来没有真正考虑过如何前往纽约，直到埃拉与老罗恩崔利交谈，他是一位埃拉教堂的成员，提出了通往纽约的高速公路的想法。
What Ella didn't know, of course, was that I would continue to see Sophia. Sophia could get awayonly a few nights a week. She said, when I told her about the train job, that she'd get away everynight I got back into Boston, and this would mean every other night, if I got the run I wanted.Sophia didn't want me to leave at all, but she believed I was draft age already, and thought thetrain job would keep me out of the Army. 
当然，埃拉不知道的是，我仍会去看索菲亚。索菲亚每周只能离开几个晚上。当我告诉她关于这份铁路工作时，她说每晚我回到波士顿，她就能离开一个晚上，如果能得到想要的工作的话，这意味着每隔一个晚上。索菲亚根本不想让我离开，但她认为我已经达到征兵年龄，并认为这份铁路工作可以让我免于入伍。
Shorty thought it would be a great chance for me. He was worried sick himself about the draft callthat he knew was soon to come. Like hundreds of the black ghetto's young men, he was takingsome stuff that, it was said, would make yourheart sound defective to the draft board's doctors. 
小个子认为这对我来说是一个很好的机会。他为自己担心着即将到来的征兵通知，就像成百上千的黑人贫民区的年轻人一样，他在服用一些据说会让心脏听起来有缺陷的东西来逃避征兵委员会的医生的检查。
Shorty felt about the war the same way I and most ghetto Negroes did: "Whitey owns everything.He wants us to go and bleed for him? Let him fight." 
小个子对战争和我和其他贫民区黑人的感觉是一样的： “白人拥有一切。他想让我们为他流血？让他去战斗吧。”
Anyway, at the railroad personnel hiring office down on Dover Street, a tired-acting old white clerkgot down to the crucial point, when I came to sign up. "Age, Little?" When I told him "Twenty-one,"he never lifted his eyes from his pencil. I knew I had the job. 
不管怎样，当我来到多佛街的铁路人员招聘办公室办理入职手续时，一位疲惫不堪的老白人职员终于问到了关键问题：“年龄，小？”当我告诉他我21岁时，他的眼睛一直没有离开他的铅笔。我知道我已经得到了这份工作。
I was promised the first available Boston-to-New York fourth-cook job. But for a while, I workedthere in the Dover Street Yard, helping to load food requisitions onto the trains. Fourth cook, Iknew, was just a glorified name for dishwasher, but it wouldn't be my first time, and just as long asI traveled where I wanted, it didn't make any difference to me. Temporarily though, they put me on"The Colonial" that ran to Washington, D.C. 
他们向我承诺了第一个可用的波士顿至纽约四等厨师职位，但在一段时间里，我在多佛街站工作，帮忙把食品需求装上火车。我知道四等厨师只是一个高级一点的洗碗工而已，但这不会是我的第一次，只要我能去我想去的地方，对我来说没有区别。暂时地，他们让我上了开往华盛顿特区的“殖民地”列车。
The kitchen crew, headed by a West Indian chef named Duke Vaughn, worked with almostunbelievable efficiency in the cramped quarters. Against the sound of the train clacking along, thewaiters were jabbering the customers' orders, the cooks operated like machines, and fivehundred miles of dirty pots and dishes and silverware rattled back to me. Then, on the overnightlayover, I naturally went sightseeing in downtown Washington. I was astounded to find in thenation's capital, just a few blocks from Capitol Hill, thousands of Negroes living worse than any I'dever seen in the poorest sections of Roxbury; in dirt-floor shacks along unspeakably filthy laneswith names like Pig Alley and Goat Alley. I had seen a lot, but never such a dense concentrationof stumblebums, pushers, hookers, public crap-shooters, even little kids running around atmidnight begging for pennies, half-naked and barefooted. Some of the railroad cooks and waitershad told me to be very careful, because muggings, knifings and robberies went on every nightamong these Negroes . . . just a few blocks from the White House. 
由一位名叫杜克·沃恩的西印度裔厨师领导的厨房团队在狭小的场地中以几乎难以置信的效率工作着。在火车咔嚓作响的声音中，服务员们忙着为顾客点餐，厨师们像机器一样操作着，五百英里的脏盘子、餐具和银器在我耳边响起。然后，在过夜停留时，我自然地去华盛顿市中心观光。我很惊讶地发现，在这个国家的首都，距离国会山只有几个街区的地方，有成千上万黑人的生活比我在罗克斯伯里最贫穷的地区看到的还要糟糕；他们住在肮脏的小屋里，沿着难以言喻的肮脏的小巷，名字叫做猪巷和山羊巷。我见过很多东西，但从未见过如此密集的穷人、流浪汉、皮条客、公共场所的赌徒，甚至还有在午夜四处奔跑乞讨零钱的小孩子们，他们赤身裸体、光着脚。一些铁路厨师和服务员告诉我要非常小心，因为这些黑人在每晚都会发生抢劫、刀伤和谋杀 . . . 就在白宫几个街区之外。
But I saw other Negroes better off; they lived in blocks of rundown red brick houses. The old"Colonial" railroaders had told me about Washington having a lot of "middle-class" Negroes withHoward University degrees, who were working as laborers, janitors, porters, guards, taxi-drivers,and the like. For the Negro in Washington, mail-carrying was a prestige job. 
但我也看到了其他过得更好的黑人；他们住在破旧的红砖建筑区。老“殖民地”铁路工人曾告诉我，华盛顿有很多拥有霍华德大学学位的“中产阶级”黑人，他们在做劳工、清洁工、搬运工、警卫、出租车司机等工作。对于在华盛顿的黑人来说，邮递员是一个有声望的工作。
After a few of the Washington runs, I snatched the chance when one day personnel said I couldtemporarily replace a sandwich man on the "Yankee Clipper" to New York. I was into my zoot suitbefore the first passenger got off. 
在几趟华盛顿的行程后，当有一天人事部说我可以在“扬基快船”上暂时替代一位三明治师傅前往纽约时，我抓住了这个机会。我在第一批乘客下车之前就已经穿上了我的奇装异服。
The cooks took me up to Harlem in a cab. White New York passed by like a movie set, thenabruptly, when we left Central Park at the upper end, at 110th Street, the people's complexionbegan to change. 
厨师们带我坐出租车去了哈莱姆。白色的纽约从我们身边飞驰而过，就像电影里的场景一样。突然间，当我们离开中央公园的上端，在110街时，人们的肤色开始变化。
Busy Seventh Avenue ran along in front of a place called Small's Paradise. The crew had told mebefore we left Boston that it was their favorite night spot in Harlem, and not to miss it . No Negroplace of business had ever impressed me so much. Around the big, luxurious-looking, circular barwere thirty or forty Negroes, mostly men, drinking and talking. 
繁忙的第七大道沿着一个叫做“小天堂”的地方延伸。在离开波士顿之前，机组人员告诉我这是他们在哈莱姆最喜欢的夜总会，千万不要错过。从来没有一家黑人商业场所给我留下如此深刻的印象。在大而豪华的圆形酒吧周围，有三四十个黑人，大部分是男性，在喝酒和聊天。
I was hit first, I think, by their conservative clothes and manners. Wherever I'd seen as many asten Boston Negroes-let alone Lansing Negroes-drinking, there had been a big noise. 
我想我是被他们的保守着装和举止所震撼的。无论我在波士顿看到多少黑人喝酒，都会引起很大的噪音。更不用说兰辛市的黑人了。
But with all of these Harlemites drinking and talking, there was just a low murmur of sound.Customers came and went. The bartenders knew what most of them drank and automaticallyfixed it. A bottle was set on the bar before some.Every Negro I'd ever known had made a point of flashing whatever money he had. But theseHarlem Negroes quietly laid a bill on the bar. They drank. They nonchalantly nodded to thebartender to pour a drink for some friend, while the bartenders, smooth as any of the customers,kept making change from the money on the bar. 
然而，尽管所有这些哈莱姆人都在喝酒和聊天，但只有低沉的嗡嗡声。顾客来来去去。调酒师知道他们中的大多数人喝什么，并且自动为他们调好饮料。有些客人一到，就有一瓶放在吧台上。我认识的每个黑人都会故意炫耀他所拥有的钱。但是这些哈莱姆人却静静地把账单放在吧台上。他们喝酒，不经意地向调酒师点头要给某个朋友倒一杯饮料，而调酒师则像顾客一样熟练地从吧台上拿钱找零。
Their manners seemed natural; they were not putting on any airs. I was awed. Within the first fiveminutes in Small's, I had left Boston and Roxbury forever. 
他们的举止自然，没有摆出任何架子。我感到非常惊叹。在Small's Paradise里，我仅仅五分钟就彻底忘记了波士顿和罗克斯伯里的一切。
I didn't yet know that these weren't what you might call everyday or average Harlem Negroes.Later on, even later that night, I would find out that Harlem contained hundreds of thousands ofmy people who were just as loud and gaudy as Negroes anywhere else. But these were thecream of the older, more mature operators in Harlem. The day's "numbers" business was done.The night's gambling and other forms of hustling hadn't yet begun. The usual night-life crowd,who worked on regular jobs all day, were at home eating their dinners. The hustlers at this timewere in the daily six o'clock congregation, having their favorite bars all over Harlem largely tothemselves. 
我还没有意识到，这些人并不是你在哈莱姆经常能看到的普通黑人。后来，甚至更晚的那个晚上，我才发现哈莱姆有数以十万计的我的同胞，他们和任何其他地方的黑人一样吵闹和华丽。但这些人是哈莱姆较老、更成熟的经营者中的佼佼者。白天的“号码”生意已经完成。夜间赌博和其他形式的骗术尚未开始。通常在夜间生活的人群，他们在白天都有正常的工作，此时都在家里吃晚餐。这个时候的骗子们正在每日六点钟的集会上，他们的最喜欢的酒吧基本上是哈莱姆自己的。
From Small's, I taxied over to the Apollo Theater. (I remember so well that Jay McShann's bandwas playing, because his vocalist was later my close friend, Walter Brown, the one who used tosing "Hooty Hooty Blues.") From there, on the other side of 125th Street, at Seventh Avenue, Isaw the big, tall, gray Theresa Hotel. It was the finest in New York City where Negroes could thenstay, years before the downtown hotels would accept the black man. (The Theresa is now bestknown as the place where Fidel Castro went during his U.N. visit, and achieved a psychologicalcoup over the U.S: State Department when it confined him to Manhattan, never dreaming thathe'd stay uptown in Harlem and make such an impression among the Negroes.) 
从Small's出来后，我打车去了阿波罗剧院。(我至今还记得Jay McShann的乐队正在演出，因为他的歌手后来成为了我的好朋友Walter Brown,他曾经唱过“Hooty Hooty Blues”。)然后，在125街对面的第七大道上，我看到了高大、灰色的Theresa Hotel酒店。那是纽约城里黑人能够住的最好的酒店，那是在市中心的酒店接受黑人入住之前很多年的事情了。(如今Theresa酒店最为人所知的是，菲德尔·卡斯特罗在那里度过了联合国访问期间，并在心理上对美国政府发动了一场政变：国务院将他限制在了曼哈顿，从未想过他会住在哈莱姆的市区，给黑人留下了深刻的印象。)
 The Braddock Hotel was just up 126th Street, near the Apollo's backstage entrance. I knew itsbar was famous as a Negro celebrity hang-out. I walked in and saw, along that jam-packed bar,such famous stars as Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and DinahWashington. 
Braddock酒店就在126街上面，靠近阿波罗剧院后台入口。我知道它的酒吧因为黑人名人的光顾而闻名。我走进去，看到那条挤满了人的酒吧里有Dizzy Gillespie、Billy Eckstine、Billie Holiday、Ella Fitzgerald和Dinah Washington等著名明星在喝酒。
As Dinah Washington was leaving with some friends, I overheard someone say she was on herway to. the Savoy Ballroom where Lionel Hampton was appearing that night-she was thenHamp's vocalist. The ballroom made the Roseland in Boston look small and shabby bycomparison. And the lindy-hopping there matched the size and elegance of the place. Hampton'shard-driving outfit kept a red-hot pace with his greats such as Amett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, DexterGordon, Alvin Hayse, Joe Newman, and George Jenkins. I went a couple of rounds on the floorwith girls from the sidelines. 
当Dinah Washington和她的朋友们离开时，我无意中听到有人说她要去Savoy舞厅，那里的Lionel Hampton当晚将登台表演。那时她是Hamp的歌手。舞厅让波士顿的Roseland相形见绌，黯然失色。在那里摇摆跳舞与这个地方的大小和优雅相匹配。Hampton的刻苦训练使他与他的大牌搭档们保持了火热的节奏，如Amett Cobb、Illinois Jacquet、Dexter Gordon、Alvin Hayse、Joe Newman和George Jenkins。我在舞池上和一些女孩们转了几圈。
Probably a third of the sideline booths were filled with white people, mostly just watching theNegroes dance; but some of them danced together, and, as in Boston, a few white women werewith Negroes. The people kept shouting for Hamp's "Flyin' Home," and finally he did it. (I couldbelieve the story I'd heard in Boston about this number-that once in the Apollo, Hamp's "Flyin'Home" had made some reefer-smoking Negro in the second balcony believe he could fly, so hetried-and jumped-and broke his leg, an event later immortalized in song when Earl Hines wrote ahit tune called "Second Balcony Jump.") I had never seen such fever-heat dancing. After a coupleof slow numbers cooled the place off, they brought on Dinah Washington. When she did her"Salty Papa Blues," those people just about tore the Savoy roof off. (Poor Dinah's funeral washeld not long ago in Chicago. I read that over twenty thousand people viewed her body, and Ishould have been there myself. Poor Dinah! We became great friends, back in those days.) 
可能有三分之一的看台上坐着白人，大部分只是观看黑人跳舞；但有些人和黑人一起跳，就像在波士顿一样，一些白女人和黑人在一块。人们不停地呼喊着Hamp的“飞回家”。
But this night of my first visit was Kitchen Mechanics' Night at the Savoy, the traditional Thursdaynight off for domestics. I'd say there were twice as manywomen as men in there, not only kitchenworkers and maids, but also war wives and defense-worker women, lonely and looking. Out in thestreet, when I left the ballroom, I heard a prostitute cursing bitterly that the professionals couldn'tdo any business because of the amateurs. 
但那天晚上是我第一次去Savoy,是Kitchen Mechanics的传统星期四夜休。我想那里有两倍于男性的女士，不仅是厨师和女佣，还有战地妻子和国防工人女性，她们孤独而渴望。当我离开舞厅时，我听到一名妓女在街上咒骂着，说专业人员无法做生意是因为业余爱好者们。
Up and down, along and between Lenox and Seventh and Eighth avenues, Harlem was likesome technicolor bazaar. Hundreds of Negro soldiers and sailors, gawking and young like me,passed by. Harlem by now was officially off limits to white servicemen. There had already beensome muggings and robberies, and several white servicemen had been found murdered. Thepolice were also trying to discourage white civilians from coming uptown, but those who wantedto still did. Every man without a woman on his arm was being "worked" by the prostitutes. "Baby,wanna have some fun?" The pimps would sidle up close, stage-whispering, "All kinds of women,Jack-want a white woman?" And the hustlers were merchandising: "Hundred-dollar ring, man,diamond; ninety-dollar watch, too-look at 'em. Take 'em both for twenty-five." 
在莱诺克斯和第七、第八大街之间，哈莱姆就像一个五彩缤纷的市场。数百名黑人士兵和水手路过，他们像我一样年轻而好奇。此时，哈莱姆已经被正式禁止白人士兵进入。已经有了一些抢劫和谋杀案，几名白人士兵被发现已经遇害。警方也试图阻止白人平民上城，但那些仍然想要来的人还是来了。每个没有女人陪伴的男人都在被妓女“工作”。“宝贝，想要玩点什么？”皮条客会悄悄靠近，低声说：“各种各样的女人，杰克，想要一个白人女人吗？”小贩们也在兜售商品：“一美元的戒指，先生，钻石；九十美元的手表，看看它们。买下它们两个只要二十五美元。”
In another two years, I could have given them all lessons. But that night, I was mesmerized. Thisworld was where I belonged. On that night I had started on my way to becoming a Harlemite. Iwas going to become one of the most depraved parasitical hustlers among New York's eightmillion people-four million of whom work, and the other four million of whom live off them. 
再过两年，我就可以教他们所有的技巧了。但那个晚上，我被迷住了。这个世界是我属于的地方。那个晚上，我开始走向哈莱姆人的道路。我要成为纽约八百万人中最堕落、最寄生虫的诈骗者之一-其中有四百万人在工作，另外四百万人靠他们生活。
I couldn't quite believe all that I'd heard and seen that night as I lugged my shoulder-strapsandwich box and that heavy five-gallon aluminum coffee pot up and down the aisles of the"Yankee Clipper" back to Boston. I wished that Ella and I had been on better terms so that I couldtry to describe to her how I felt. But I did talk to Shorty, urging him to at least go to see the BigApple music world. Sophia listened to me, too. She told me that I'd never be satisfied anywherebut New York. She was so right. In one night, New York-Harlem-had just about narcotized me.That sandwich man I'd replaced had little chance of getting his job back. I went bellowing up anddown those train aisles. I sold sandwiches, coffee, candy, cake, and ice cream as fast as therailroad's commissary department could supply them. It didn't take me a week to learn that all youhad to do was give white people a show and they'd buy anything you offered them. It was likepopping your shoeshine rag. The dining car waiters and Pullman porters knew it too, and theyfaked their Uncle Tomming to get bigger tips. We were in that world of Negroes who are bothservants and psychologists, aware that white people are so obsessed with their own importancethat they will pay liberally, even dearly, for the impression of being catered to and entertained. 
当我拖着肩带三明治盒和沉重的五加仑铝制咖啡壶，在“Yankee Clipper”车厢里来回走动时，我无法完全相信那个晚上所听到和看到的一切。我希望我和艾拉的关系能更好一些，这样我就能够试图向她描述我的感觉了。但我还是和Shorty谈过，劝他至少去见识一下纽约的音乐世界。Sophia也听了我的话。她告诉我，除了纽约，我永远不会满足。她说得没错。在那个晚上，纽约-哈莱姆-几乎让我上瘾了。我取代的那个三明治小贩几乎没有机会再得到这份工作。我在火车车厢里大声叫卖三明治、咖啡、糖果、蛋糕和冰淇淋，速度之快让铁路供应部门都跟不上。我在一个星期内就学会了一件事情：只要给白人一个表演，他们就会买你提供的所有东西。这就像是给你擦鞋一样简单。餐车服务员和卧铺搬运工也知道这一点，他们会假装自己的“汤姆叔叔”，以获得更高的小费。我们生活在黑人既是仆人又是心理医生的世界里，意识到白人对他们自己的重要性有着如此强烈的执着，他们愿意慷慨地甚至不惜代价地为了被照顾和娱乐的感觉而花钱。
Every layover night in Harlem, I ran and explored new places. I first got a room at the HarlemYMCA, because it was less than a block from Small's Paradise. Then, I got a cheaper room atMrs. Fisher's rooming house which was close to the YMCA. Most of the railroad men stayed atMrs. Fisher's. I combed not only the bright-light areas, but Harlem's residential areas from best toworst, from Sugar Hill up near the Polo Grounds, where many famous celebrities lived, down tothe slum blocks of old rat-trap apartment houses, just crawling with everything you could mentionthat was illegal and immoral. Dirt, garbage cans overflowing or kicked over; drunks, dope addicts,beggars. Sleazy bars, store-front churches with gospels being shouted inside, "bargain" stores,hockshops, undertaking parlors. Greasy "home-cooking" restaurants, beauty shops smoky insidefrom Negro women's hair getting fried, barbershops advertising conk experts. Cadillacs,secondhand and new, conspicuous among the cars on the streets. 
在哈莱姆的每个过夜停留中，我都会跑去探索新的地方。我第一次住在哈莱姆YMCA附近的房间，因为它距离Small's Paradise不到一个街区。然后，我搬到了离YMCA更近的Fisher夫人的旅馆，那里的价格更便宜。大多数铁路工人都住在Fisher夫人的旅馆里。我不仅去了明亮的区域，还从最好的到最差的哈莱姆住宅区进行了调查，从靠近Polo Grounds的Sugar Hill开始，那里住着许多著名的名人，一直到老蟑螂公寓楼的贫民窟区，那里充斥着所有你能想到的非法和不道德的东西。肮脏、垃圾桶溢出或被踢倒；醉汉、吸毒成瘾者、乞丐。肮脏的酒吧、商店前教堂里传出福音的声音，“廉价”商店、当铺、殡仪馆。油腻的“家常菜”餐馆、美容店里面烟雾弥漫，黑人女性的头发在那里被炸熟了，理发店宣传自己的专家是“秃顶”。街上的车中，二手和全新的凯迪拉克汽车格外显眼。
All of it was Lansing's West Side or Roxbury's South End magnified a thousand times. Littlebasement dance halls with "For Rent" signs on them. People offering you little cards advertising"rent-raising parties." I went to one of these-thirty or forty Negroes sweating, eating, drinking,dancing, and gamblingin a jammed, beat-up apartment, the record player going full blast, the friedchicken or chitlins with potato salad and collard greens for a dollar a plate, and cans of beer orshots of liquor for fifty cents. Negro and white canvassers sidled up alongside you, talking fast asthey tried to get you to buy a copy of the _Daily Worker_: "This paper's trying to keep your rentcontrolled . . . Make that greedy landlord kill them rats in your apartment . . . This paperrepresents the only political party that ever ran a black man for the Vice Presidency of the UnitedStates . . . Just want you to read, won't take but a little of your time . . . Who do you think foughtthe hardest to help free those Scottsboro boys?" Things I overheard among Negroes when thesalesmen were around let me know that the paper somehow was tied in with the Russians, but tomy sterile mind in those early days, it didn't mean much; the radio broadcasts and thenewspapers were then full of our-ally-Russia, a strong, muscular people, peasants, with theirbacks to the wall helping America to fight Hitler and Mussolini. 
这一切都像是Lansing的西区或Roxbury的南端放大了一千倍。小地下室舞厅里挂着“出租”标志。人们会给你一些小卡片，上面宣传着“租户提高派对”。我去了其中一个-30或40名黑人汗流浃背地吃喝跳舞和赌博在一个拥挤破旧的公寓里，唱片机播放着震耳欲聋的音乐，炸鸡或内脏配土豆沙拉和羽衣甘蓝每盘只要一美元，啤酒或烈酒每罐50美分。黑人和白人推销员会悄悄地靠近你，说话很快，试图让你买一份《劳动报》： “这份报纸试图控制你的房租...让那个贪婪的房东杀死你公寓里的老鼠...这份报纸代表了唯一一个曾经为美国副总统选举选出一名黑人的政党...只想让你读一下，不会占用太多时间...谁认为最努力帮助释放那些斯科特堡男孩？”当销售员在场时，我在黑人中间听到的一些事情告诉我，这份报纸似乎与俄罗斯有关，但在那些早期的日子里，在我枯燥无味的头脑中，这并没有什么意义；当时的广播和报纸充满了我们的盟友-俄罗斯，一个强壮而有肌肉的人种，农民们背靠着墙壁帮助美国对抗希特勒和墨索里尼。
But New York was heaven to me . And Harlem was Seventh Heaven! I hung around in Small's andthe Braddock bar so much that the bartenders began to pour a shot of bourbon, my favorite brandof it, when they saw me walk in the door. And the steady customers in both places, the hustlers inSmall's and the entertainers in the Braddock, began to call me "Red," a natural enough nicknamein view of my bright red conk. I now had my conk done in Boston at the shop of Abbott andFogey; it was the best conk shop on the East Coast, according to the musical greats who hadrecommended it to me . 
但对我来说，纽约就是天堂。而哈莱姆则是第七天堂！我经常在Small's和Braddock酒吧闲逛，所以当酒保看到我走进门时，他们开始给我倒一杯波本威士忌，这是我最喜欢的品牌。在这两个地方，有稳定的顾客、Small's的流浪汉和Braddock的艺人开始称呼我为“Red”，因为我的红发自然而然地成为了我的绰号。现在我在Boston的Abbott and Fogey商店染了一头红色的头发；据那些向我推荐它的音乐大师们说，这是东海岸最好的染发店。
My friends now included musicians like Duke Ellington's great drummer, Sonny Greer, and thatgreat personality with the violin, Ray Nance. He's the one who used to stag in that wild "scat"style: "Blip-blip-de-blop-de-blam-blam-" And people like Cootie Williams, and Eddie "Cleanhead"Vinson, who'd kid me about his conk-he had nothing up there but skin. He was hitting the heightsthen with his song, "Hey, PrettyMama, Chunk Me In Your Big Brass Bed." I also knew Sy Oliver;he was married to a red-complexioned girl, and they lived up on Sugar Hill; Sy did a lot ofarranging for Tommy Dorsey in those days. His most famous tune, I believe, was "Yes, Indeed!" 
我的朋友圈里现在包括了像Duke Ellington的伟大鼓手Sonny Greer和那位带着小提琴的个性鲜明的人Ray Nance。他以前常常用“scat”风格演唱： “Blip-blip-de-blop-de-blam-blam-”。还有像Cootie Williams和Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson这样的人，他们会开玩笑地谈论他的红发，他那里只有皮肤。他当时正处于巅峰状态，他的歌曲“Hey, Pretty Mama, Chunk Me In Your Big Brass Bed”也很受欢迎。我还认识Sy Oliver;他娶了一个红肤色的女孩，他们住在Sugar Hill上；在那些日子里，Sy为Tommy Dorsey做了很多安排。我认为他最著名的曲子是“Yes, Indeed!”。
The regular "Yankee Clipper" sandwich man, when he came back, was put on another train. Hecomplained about seniority, but my sales record made them placate him some other way. Thewaiters and cooks had begun to call me "Sandwich Red." 
那个经常卖“扬基快船”三明治的男人回来后，被安排在另一列火车上。他抱怨资历，但因为我的销售额记录，他们用其他方式安抚了他。服务员和厨师们开始称呼我为“三明治红”。
By that time, they had a laughing bet going that I wasn't going to last, sales or not, because I hadso rapidly become such an uncouth, wild young Negro. Profanity had become my language. I'deven curse customers, especially servicemen; I couldn't stand them. I remember that once, whensome passenger complaints had gotten me a warning, and I wanted to be careful, I was workingdown the aisle and a big, beefy, red-faced cracker soldier got up in front of me, so drunk he wasweaving, and announced loud enough that everybody in the car heard him, "I'm going to fightyou, nigger." I remember the tension. I laughed and told him, "Sure, I'll fight, but you've got toomany clothes on." He had on a big Army overcoat. He took that off, and I kept laughing and saidhe still had on too many. I was able to keep that cracker stripping off clothes until he stood theredrunk with nothing on from his pants up, and the whole car was laughing at him, and some othersoldiers got him out of the way. I went on. I never would forget that-that I couldn't have whippedthat white man as badly with a club as I had with my mind. 
那时，他们打赌我不会坚持下去，无论是卖还是不卖，因为我迅速地变成了一个粗野、狂野的年轻黑人。脏话已经成为我的语言。我甚至会咒骂顾客，尤其是士兵；我无法忍受他们。我记得有一次，当一些乘客的投诉让我收到警告时，我想小心一点，我在走道上工作，一个大块头、满脸通红的士兵站起来站在我前面，他喝得烂醉如泥，大声宣布让车厢里的每个人都听到了他的话：“我要和你打架，黑鬼。”我记得那种紧张的气氛。我笑了，告诉他：“当然，我会打架，但你穿的衣服太多了。”他穿着一件大军用外套。他脱下了外套，我一直笑着告诉他他仍然穿了太多衣服。我可以继续让这个白人脱衣服，直到他站在那里烂醉如泥，从裤子到上面什么也没穿，整个车厢都在嘲笑他，其他一些士兵把他赶走了。我继续工作。我永远不会忘记-我不能用棍子打败那个白人，就像我用思想打败他一样。
Many of the New Haven Line's cooks and waiters still in railroad service today will remember oldPappy Cousins. He was the "Yankee Clipper" steward, a white man, of course, from Maine.(Negroes had been in dining car service as much as thirty and forty years, but in those days therewere no Negro stewardson the New Haven Line.) Anyway, Pappy Cousins loved whisky, and heliked everybody, even me. A lot of passenger complaints about me, Pappy had let slide. He'd asksome of the old Negroes working with me to try and calm me down. 
许多仍在铁路服务的新罕布什尔线上的厨师和服务员仍然会记得老派普皮·卡曾斯。他是“扬基快船”的乘务员，当然是一个来自缅因州的白人。(在那些日子里，黑人在餐车服务中已经存在了30到40年，但在新罕布什尔线上没有黑人乘务员。)无论如何，派普皮·卡曾斯喜欢威士忌，他喜欢每一个人，甚至包括我。很多乘客对我的投诉，派普皮·卡曾斯都放任不管。他会让和我一起工作的一些老黑人试着让我冷静下来。
"Man, you can't tell him nothing!" they'd exclaim. And they couldn't. At home in Roxbury, theywould see me parading with Sophia, dressed in my wild zoot suits. Then I'd come to work, loudand wild and half-high on liquor or reefers, and I'd stay that way, jamming sandwiches at peopleuntil we got to New York. Off the train, I'd go through that Grand Central Station afternoon rush- hour crowd, and many white people simply stopped in their tracks to watch me pass. The drapeand the cut of a zoot suit showed to the best advantage if you were tall-and I was over six feet.My conk was fire-red. I was really a clown, but my ignorance made me think I was "sharp." Myknob-toed, orange-colored "kick-up" shoes were nothing but Florsheims, the ghetto's Cadillac ofshoes in those days. (Some shoe companies made these ridiculous styles for sale only in theblack ghettoes where ignorant Negroes like me would pay the big-name price for something thatwe associated with being rich.) And then, between Small's Paradise, the Braddock Hotel, andother places-as much as my twenty-or twenty-five-dollar pay would allow, I drank liquor, smokedmarijuana, painted the Big Apple red with increasing numbers of friends, and finally in Mrs.Fisher's rooming house I got a few hours of sleep before the "Yankee Clipper" rolled again. 
“天啊，你什么都别说！”他们会惊呼。而他们真的不能不说。在罗克斯伯里的家里，他们会看到我和索菲亚一起走来走去，穿着我的疯狂的奇士牌西装。然后我就会来上班，大声、狂野、酒足饭饱，我会一直这样，不停地卖三明治给人们，直到我们到达纽约。下了火车后，我会穿过中央车站下午的高峰人群，许多白人都停下来看着我走过。如果身材高大的话，奇士牌西装的剪裁和颜色可以展示出最好的效果-我有六英尺多高。我的红头发闪闪发光。我真的像个小丑，但我的无知让我认为我很“聪明”。我的脚趾是平的，橙色的“翘跟”鞋就是Florsheims,那个时代黑人贫民窟里Cadillac(凯迪拉克)汽车。(有些鞋公司为这些荒谬的款式只在黑人贫民窟里销售，那些像我这样的无知黑人会为名牌鞋子支付大价钱，而我们只是把它们与财富联系在一起。)然后，在Small's Paradise、Braddock Hotel和其他地方-只要我的工资允许，我就会在Small's Paradise、Braddock Hotel和其他地方喝酒、

It was inevitable that I was going to be fired sooner or later. What finally finished me was an angryletter from a passenger. The conductors added their-bit, telling how many verbal complaintsthey'd had, and how many warnings I'd been given. 
我迟早会被解雇，最终让我下岗的是一封愤怒的乘客来信。售票员也添油加醋地说了许多口头抱怨，以及我收到了多少次警告。
 But I didn't care, because in those wartime days such jobs as I could aspire to were goingbegging. When the New Haven Line paid me off, I decided it would be nice to make a trip to visitmy brothers and sisters in Lansing. I had accumulated some railroad free-travel privileges. 
但我并不在意，因为在那些战时的日子里，我能期望的工作都是要乞讨的。当纽黑文线付给我遣散费时，我决定去拜访我在兰辛的兄弟姐妹会是一件不错的事情。我已经积累了一些铁路免费旅行特权。
None of them back in Michigan could believe it was me. Only my oldest brother, Wilfred, wasn'tthere; he was away at Wilberforce University in Ohio studying a trade. But Philbert and Hildawere working in Lansing. Reginald, the one who had always looked up to me, had gotten bigenough to fake his age, and he was planning soon to enter the merchant marine. Yvonne, Wesleyand Robert were in school. 
他们中的所有人都无法相信那是我。只有我最年长的哥哥威尔弗雷德没有在场，他当时在俄亥俄州的威伯福斯大学学习一门手艺。但是菲尔伯特和希尔达在兰辛工作。雷金纳德一直很崇拜我，他已经长大到可以假装年龄了，并且他计划很快进入商业海运业。伊冯、韦斯利和罗伯特都在上学。
My conk and whole costume were so wild that I might have been taken as a man from Mars. Icaused a minor automobile collision; one driver stopped to gape at me, and the driver behindbumped into him. My appearance staggered the older boys I had once envied; I'd stick out myhand, saying "Skin me, daddy-o!" My stories about the Big Apple, my reefers keeping me sky- high-wherever I went, I was the life of the party. "My man! . . . Gimme some skin!" 
我的发型和整个服装都非常疯狂，我可能被误认为是火星人。我引起了一次轻微的汽车碰撞；一位司机停下来目瞪口呆地看着我，后面的司机撞上了他。我的样子让我曾经嫉妒的年长男孩们感到惊愕；我会伸出手说：“给我打个皮球，爸爸！”关于纽约市的故事，我的毒品让我在任何地方都飘飘欲仙，我是聚会上的主角。“伙计...给我点乐子！”
The only thing that brought me down to earth was the visit to the state hospital in Kalamazoo. Mymother sort of half-sensed who I was. 
唯一把我拉回现实的是在卡拉马祖州立医院的一次访问。我的母亲对我的身份有些半知半解。
And I looked up Shorty's mother. I knew he'd be touched by my doing that. She was an old lady,and she was glad to hear from Shorty through me. I told her that Shorty was doing fine and oneday was going to be a great leader of his own band. She asked me to tell Shorty that she wishedhe'd write her, and send her something. 
我找到了Shorty的母亲。我知道他会被我的举动所感动。她是一位年迈的老太太，很高兴能通过我来听到Shorty的消息。我告诉她Shorty过得很好，有一天会成为一个伟大的领袖，领导自己的乐队。她让我告诉Shorty,她希望他能给她写信，并寄些东西过来。
And I dropped over to Mason to see Mrs. Swerlin, the woman at the detention home who hadkept me those couple of years. Her mouth flew open when shecame to the door. My sharkskingray "Cab Calloway" zoot suit, the long, narrow, knob-toed shoes, and the four-inch-brimmedpearl-gray hat over my conked fire-red hair; it was just about too much for Mrs. Swerlin. She justmanaged to pull herself together enough to invite me in. Between the way I looked and my styleof talk, I made her so nervous and uncomfortable that we were both glad when I left. 
我到Mason去拜访了Swerlin夫人，她在拘留所里照顾了我好几年。当她走到门口时，她张大了嘴巴。我穿着我的鲨鱼斑纹“Cab Calloway”奇装异服，长长的窄鞋和四英寸边缘的珍珠灰色帽子盖在我的红头发上；这对Swerlin夫人来说简直难以承受。她勉强让自己冷静下来，邀请我进去。我的外表和说话方式让她感到紧张和不舒服，我们俩都很高兴我离开了。
The night before I left, a dance was given in the Lincoln School gymnasium. (I've since learnedthat in a strange city, to find the Negroes without asking where, you just check in the phone bookfor a "Lincoln School." It's always located in the segregated black ghetto-at least it was, in thosedays.) I'd left Lansing unable to dance, but now I went around the gymnasium floor flinging littlegirls over my shoulders and hips, showing my most startling steps. Several times, the little bandnearly stopped, and nearly everybody left the floor, watching with their eyes like saucers. Thatnight, I even signed autographs-"Harlem Red"-and I left Lansing shocked and rocked. 
在我离开的前一天晚上，在林肯学校体育馆里举行了一场舞会。(后来我了解到，在一个陌生的城市里，要找到黑人而不问他们在哪里，你只需要在电话簿上查找“林肯学校”。它总是位于隔离的黑人贫民区-至少在那些日子里是这样)。我已经离开了兰辛城，无法跳舞，但现在我在体育馆地板上四处走动，将小姑娘们抛向我的肩膀和臀部，展示最令人震惊的舞步。几次，小乐队几乎停了下来，几乎所有人都离开了舞台，用他们的大眼睛盯着我看。那晚，我甚至签了名 - “Harlem Red”，然后我震惊地离开了兰辛城。
Back in New York, stone broke and without any means of support, I realized that the railroad wasall that I actually knew anything about. So I went over to the Seaboard Line's hiring office. Therailroads needed men so badly that all I had to do was tell them I had worked on the New Haven,and two days later I was on the "Silver Meteor" to St. Petersburg and Miami. Renting pillows andkeeping the coaches clean and the white passengers happy, I made about as much as I had withsandwiches. 
回到纽约后，我一无所有，意识到铁路是我唯一真正了解的东西。于是我去了Seaboard Line的招聘办公室。由于铁路急需人手，我只需要告诉他们我在New Haven工作过，两天后我就上了“银色流星”到圣彼得堡和迈阿密。我租了枕头，保持车厢干净，让白人乘客满意，我的收入与卖三明治时差不多。
I soon ran afoul of the Florida cracker who was assistant conductor. Back in New York, they toldme to find another job. But that afternoon, when I walked into Small's Paradise, one of thebartenders, knowing how much I loved New York, called me aside and said that if I were wilting toquit the railroad, I might be able to replace a day waiter who was about to go into the Army. 
我很快就与佛罗里达州的一位助理指挥官发生了冲突。回到纽约后，他们告诉我去找另一份工作。但那天下午，当我走进Small's Paradise时，其中一位酒保知道我多么喜欢纽约，就把我叫到一边说，如果我想放弃铁路工作，也许可以替换一名即将入伍的服务员。
 The owner of the bar was Ed Small. He and his brother Charlie were inseparable, and I guessHarlem didn't have two more popular and respected people. They knew I was a railroad man,which, for a waiter, was the best kind of recommendation. Charlie Small was the one I actuallytalked with in their office. I was afraid he'd want to wait to ask some of his old-timer railroadfriends for their opinion. Charlie wouldn't have gone for anybody he heard was wild. But hedecided on the basis of his own impression, having seen me in his place so many times, sittingquietly, almost in awe, observing the hustling set. I told him, when he asked, that I'd never been introuble with the police-and up to then, that was the truth. Charlie told me their rules foremployees: no lateness, no laziness, no stealing, no kind of hustling off any customers, especiallymen in uniform. And I was hired. 
这家酒吧的老板是Ed Small。他和他的兄弟Charlie密不可分，我想Harlem可能没有比他们更受欢迎和受尊敬的人了。他们知道我是个铁路工人，对于服务员来说，这是最好的推荐。Charlie Small是我实际与他们在办公室交谈的人。我很担心他会想等他的老铁路朋友发表意见。Charlie不会接受任何听起来很疯狂的人。但他根据自己的印象做出了决定，因为他看到我在那个地方坐了很多次，安静地观察着忙碌的场景。我告诉他，当他问我时，我从未与警方有过麻烦-到那时为止，这是真的。Charlie告诉我他们的员工规则：不迟到、不懒惰、不偷窃、不从顾客身上“搞钱”，尤其是穿制服的男人。然后我就被雇用了。
This was in 1942.I had just turned seventeen. 
这是在1942年。我刚刚十七岁。

With Small's practically in the center of everything, waiting tables there was Seventh Heavenseven times over. Charlie Small had no need to caution me against being late; I was so anxiousto be there, I'd arrive an hour early. I relieved the morning waiter. As far as he was concerned,mine was the slowest, most no-tips time of day, and sometimes he'd stick around most of thathour teaching me things, for he didn't want to see me fired. 
Small's Paradise几乎位于所有地方的中心，在那里当服务员简直是七重天。Charlie Small不需要警告我不要迟到；我非常渴望到达那里，我会提前一个小时到达。我取代了早上的服务员。对于他来说，我的服务是最慢、最不给小费的时间，有时他会在那个小时里留下来教我一些东西，因为他不希望看到我被解雇。
Thanks to him, I learned very quickly dozens of little things that could really ingratiate a newwaiter with the cooks and bartenders. Both of these, depending on how they liked the waiter,could make his job miserable or pleasant-and I meant to become indispensable. Inside of a week,I had succeeded with both. And the customers who had seen me among them around the bar,recognizing me now in the waiter's jacket, were pleased and surprised; and they couldn't havebeen more friendly. And I couldn't have been more solicitous."Another drink? . . . Right away, sir . . . Would you like dinner? . . . It's very good  . . . Could I getyou a menu, sir? . . . Well, maybe a sandwich?" 
感谢他，我很快学会了几十件小事情，这些事情可以让一个新服务员赢得厨师和调酒师的好感。这两个人，根据他们对服务员的喜好，可以让他的工作变得痛苦或愉快-我的意思是成为不可或缺的人。在一周内，我成功地做到了这两点。那些在酒吧里看到我在他们中间穿梭的顾客，现在认出了穿着服务员夹克的我，感到高兴和惊讶；他们非常友好。而我也更加周到。“再来一杯？...马上，先生...您想吃晚饭吗？...非常好...我可以给您拿菜单吗，先生？...嗯，也许来个三明治？”
Not only the bartenders and cooks, who knew everything about everything, it seemed to me, buteven the customers, also began to school me, in little conversations by the bar when I wasn'tbusy. Sometimes a customer would talk to me as he ate. Sometimes I'd have long talks- absorbing everything-with the real old-timers, who had been around Harlem since Negroes firstcame there. 
不仅是那些对所有事情都了如指掌的调酒师和厨师，似乎就连顾客也开始教育我，在我忙碌的时候在酒吧里进行小小的谈话。有时一个顾客会在吃饭时和我交谈。有时我会和真正的老前辈进行长时间的谈话-吸收一切-他们自黑人第一次来到哈莱姆就在那里。
That, in fact, was one of my biggest surprises: that Harlem hadn't always been a community ofNegroes. 
事实上，这却是我最大的惊喜之一：哈莱姆并不总是黑人社区。
It first had been a Dutch settlement, I learned. Then began the massive waves of poor and half- starved and ragged immigrants from Europe, arriving with everything they owned in the world inbags and sacks on their backs. The Germans came first; the Dutch edged away from them, andHarlem became all German. 
我了解到，它最初是一个荷兰定居点。然后开始有大量的贫穷和半饥饿的破烂移民从欧洲涌入，他们背着袋子和背包带着世界上所有的财物到达。首先是德国人；荷兰人逐渐远离他们，哈莱姆变成了德国人的天下。
Then came the Irish, running from the potato famine. The Germans ran, looking down their nosesat the Irish, who took over Harlem. Next, the Italians; same thing-the Irish ran from them. TheItalians had Harlem when the Jews came down the gangplanks-and then the Italians left. 
然后是爱尔兰人，他们逃离了土豆饥荒。德国人逃跑时看不起爱尔兰人，爱尔兰人接管了哈莱姆。接下来是意大利人；同样的情况-爱尔兰人逃离了他们。犹太人从舷梯下来时，意大利人已经控制了哈莱姆-然后意大利人离开了。
Today, all these same immigrants' descendants are running as hard as they can to escape thedescendants of the Negroes who helped to unload the immigrant ships. 
今天，所有这些相同移民的后代都在竭尽全力逃离那些帮助卸货移民船的黑人后代。
I was staggered when old-timer Harlemites told me that while this immigrant musical chairs gamehad been going on, Negroes had been in New York City since 1683, before any of them came,and had been ghettoed all over the city.They had first been in the Wall Street area; then theywere pushed into Greenwich Village. The next shove was up to the Pennsylvania Station area.And men, the last stop before Harlem, the black ghetto was concentrated around 52nd Street,which is how 52nd Street got the Swing Street name and reputation that lasted long after theNegroes were gone. 
当老哈莱姆人告诉我，尽管这场移民的“抢椅子”游戏一直在进行，但黑人在纽约市早在1683年就已存在，比他们来之前还要早，并且在整个城市都形成了贫民窟。他们最初在华尔街地区；然后被赶进了格林威治村。下一次是推到了宾夕法尼亚车站地区。而男人们，在哈莱姆之前的最后一站，黑人贫民窟集中在第52街附近，这就是为什么第52街得到了“摇摆街”的名字和声誉，在黑人离开后很久仍然存在。
Then, in 1910, a Negro real estate man somehow got two or three Negro families into one JewishHarlem apartment house. The Jews flew from that house, then from that block, and moreNegroes came in to fill their apartments. Then whole blocks of Jews ran, and still more Negroescame uptown, until in a short time, Harlem was like it still is today-virtually all black. 
然后，在1910年，一位黑人房地产商不知何故将两三个黑人家庭安置在了一座犹太哈莱姆公寓楼里。犹太人离开了那座房子，然后离开了那个街区，更多的黑人搬进来填补他们的公寓。然后整个街区的犹太人都逃走了，更多的黑人搬到了城里，直到不久之后，哈莱姆就像现在一样-几乎是完全的黑人社区。
Then, early in the 1920's music and entertainment sprang up as an industry in Harlem, supportedby downtown whites who poured uptown every night. It all started about the time a tough youngNew Orleans cornet man named Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong climbed off a train in New Yorkwearing clodhopper policemen's shoes, and started playing with Fletcher Henderson. In 1925,Small's Paradise had opened with crowds all across Seventh Avenue; in 1926, the great CottonClub, where Duke Ellington's band would play for five years; also in 1926 the Savoy Ballroomopened, a whole block front on Lenox Avenue, with a two-hundred-foot dance floor underspotlights before two bandstands and a disappearing rear stage. 
然后，在20世纪20年代初期，音乐和娱乐业在哈莱姆兴起，得到了每天晚上涌入城里的市中心白人的支持。这一切始于一个名叫路易斯·“萨蒂”·阿姆斯特朗的年轻新奥尔良小号手爬下纽约火车站，穿着警察的厚底鞋开始与弗莱彻·亨德森一起演奏。1925年，Small's Paradise在第七大道上吸引了众多人群；1926年，伟大的Cotton Club开业，杜克·艾灵顿的乐队在那里演奏了五年；同样是在1926年，Savoy Ballroom开业，整个街区都在莱诺克斯大道上，有一个两百英尺长的舞池，在两个乐队舞台和一个消失的后舞台前的聚光灯下。
Harlem's famous image spread until it swarmed nightly with white people from all over the world.The tourist buses came there. The Cotton Club catered to whites only, and hundreds of otherclubs ranging on down to cellar speakeasies catered to white people's money. Some of the best- known were Connie's Inn, the Lenox Club, Barron's, The Nest Club, Jimmy's Chicken Shack, andMinton's. The Savoy, the Golden Gate, and the 
哈莱姆的著名形象传播开来，直到它每晚都聚集了来自世界各地的白人。旅游巴士也开到这里。Cotton Club只迎合白人，还有数百家从底层地下室到高级俱乐部的俱乐部迎合着白人的金钱。其中一些最著名的是康妮旅馆、莱诺克斯俱乐部、巴伦周刊、巢穴俱乐部、吉米炸鸡店和明顿餐厅。Savoy、Golden Gate和
Renaissance ballrooms battled for the crowds-the Savoy introduced such attractions as ThursdayKitchen Mechanics' Nights, bathing beauty contests, and a new car given away each Saturdaynight. They had bands from all across the country in the ballrooms and the Apollo and Lafayettetheaters. They had colorful bandleaders like 'Fess Williams in his diamond-studded suit and tophat, and Cab Calloway in his white zoot suit to end all zoots, and his wide-brimmed white hat andstring tie, setting Harlem afire with "Tiger Rag" and "St. James Infirmary" and "Minnie theMoocher." 
文艺复兴舞厅为吸引人群而竞争-Savoy引入了诸如周四厨房机械师之夜、沐浴美丽比赛和每周六晚上赠送一辆新车等吸引人的活动。他们在舞厅和阿波罗剧院以及拉斐特剧院有来自全国各地的乐队。他们有像“费斯·威廉姆斯”这样的多彩的乐队领队，穿着镶钻的西装和礼帽，还有卡巴·卡拉维尔穿着他那件白色的紧身裤，结束了所有紧身裤，他的宽边白帽子和细绳领带，点燃了哈莱姆的“老虎之舞”和“圣詹姆斯医院”以及“米妮老鼠”。
Blacktown crawled with white people, with pimps, prostitutes, bootleggers, with hustlers of allkinds, with colorful characters, and with police and prohibition agents. Negroes danced like theynever have anywhere before or since. I guess I must have heard twenty-five of the old-timers inSmall's swear to me that they had been the first to dance in the Savoy the "Lindy Hop" which wasborn there in 1927, named for Lindbergh, who had just made his flight to Paris. 
黑人区挤满了白人，有皮条客、妓女、私酒贩子、各种各样的小偷，以及各种色彩缤纷的人物，还有警察和禁酒令执法人员。黑人在萨维尔舞厅跳舞的样子前所未有，我想我肯定听到了25个老哈莱姆人在Small's对我说他们曾经是第一批在萨维尔舞厅跳“林迪舞”的人，这种舞蹈于1927年在萨维尔舞厅诞生，以林德伯格的名字命名，他刚刚完成了飞往巴黎的飞行。
Even the little cellar places with only piano space had fabulous keyboard artists such as James P.Johnson and Jelly Roll Morton, and singers such as Ethel Waters. And at four A.M., when all thelegitimate clubs had to close, from all over town the white and Negro musicians would come tosome prearranged Harlem after-hours spot and have thirty-and forty-piece jam sessions thatwould last into the next day. 
即使是只有钢琴空间的小地下室场所，也有出色的键盘艺术家，如詹姆斯·P·约翰逊和杰里·罗·莫顿，还有歌手，如伊莎尔·沃特斯。而在凌晨4点，当所有合法的俱乐部都必须关闭时，来自全城的白人和黑人音乐家会来到事先安排好的哈莱姆夜场，进行30到40人的现场演出，一直持续到第二天。
When it all ended with the stock market crash in 1929, Harlem had a world reputation asAmerica's Casbah. Small's had been a part of all that. There, I heard the old-timers reminisceabout all those great times. 
当一切在1929年股市崩盘中结束时，哈莱姆以美国卡斯巴的声誉闻名于世。Small's也是这一切的一部分。在那里，我听到老一辈人回忆起那些美好的时光。
Every day I listened raptly to customers who felt like talking, and it all added to my education. Myears soaked it up like sponges when one of them, in a rare burst of confidence, or a little beyondhis usual number of drinks, would tell me inside things about the particular form of hustling that hepursued as a wayof life. I was thus schooled well, by experts in such hustles as the numbers,pimping, con games of many kinds, peddling dope, and thievery of all sorts, including armedrobbery. 
每天我都聚精会神地听着那些想要聊天的顾客，这些都为我的教育增添了不少。
第六章
DETROIT RED 
底特律红
Every day, I would gamble all of my tips-as high as fifteen and twenty dollars-on the numbers,and dream of what I would do when I hit. 
每天，我都会把我的小费-高达15到20美元-全部赌在数字上，梦想着当我赢了会做什么。
I saw people on their long, wild spending sprees, after big hits. I don't mean just hustlers whoalways had some money. I mean ordinary working people, the kind that we otherwise almostnever saw in a bar like Small's, who, with a good enough hit, had quit their jobs workingsomewhere downtown for the white man. Often they had bought a Cadillac, and sometimes forthree and four days, they were setting up drinks and buying steaks for all their friends. I wouldhave to pull two tables together into one, and they would be throwing me two-and three-dollar tipseach time I came with my tray. 
我看到人们在赢得大笔奖金后，开始了漫长的疯狂花钱之旅。我并不是指那些总是有一些钱的皮条客，而是指普通上班族，那种我们在Small's这样的酒吧里几乎看不到的人。只要他们有足够的运气，就会辞去在市中心为白人工作的工作。通常他们会买一辆凯迪拉克，有时连续三四天，他们会为所有的朋友准备饮料和牛排。我不得不把两张桌子拼在一起，每次我拿着托盘来的时候，他们会给我两到三美元的小费。
Hundreds of thousands of New York City Negroes, every day but Sunday, would play from apenny on up to large sums on three-digit numbers. A hit meant duplicating the last three figures ofthe Stock Exchange's printed daily total of U.S. domestic and foreign sales. 
每天除了星期日，纽约市的数以十万计的黑人会花费从一分钱到大笔金额在三位数字上。一次胜利意味着复制股票交易所每日国内和外国销售总额的最后三位数字。
With the odds at six hundred to one, a penny hit won $6, a dollar won $600, and so on. On $15,the hit would mean $9,000. Famous hits like that had bought controlling interests in lots ofHarlem's bars and restaurants, or even bought some of them outright. The chances of hittingwere a thousand to one. Many players practiced what was called "combinating." For example sixcentswould put one penny on each of the six possible combinations of three digits. The number840, combinated, would include 840, 804, 048, 084, 408, and 480. 
赔率为六百比一，一分钱的胜利意味着赢得6美元，一美元的胜利意味着赢得600美元，以此类推。在15美元的胜利中，意味着赢得9,000美元。像这样的著名胜利已经买下了哈莱姆许多酒吧和餐厅的控制权，甚至有些人直接买下了它们。中奖的机会是一比一千。许多玩家练习所谓的“组合”。例如，六个便士会将一个便士放在每种可能的三个数字组合中的每一个上。数字840组合后将包括840、804、048、084、408和480。
Practically everyone played every day in the poverty-ridden black ghetto of Harlem. Every day,someone you knew was likely to hit and of course it was neighborhood news; if big enough a hit,neighborhood excitement. Hits generally were small; a nickel, dime, or a quarter. Most peopletried to play a dollar a day, but split it up among different numbers and combinated. 
在贫穷的哈莱姆黑人社区，几乎每个人都每天玩。每天都有人可能赢得胜利，当然这是社区新闻；如果赢得足够大的胜利，就会引发社区兴奋。胜利通常都很小，只有五分钱、一毛钱或二分钱。大多数人尝试每天玩一美元，但会将它分散在不同的数字和组合上。
Harlem's numbers industry hummed every morning and into the early afternoon, with the runnersjotti ng down people's bets on slips of paper in apartment house hallways, bars, barbershops,stores, on the sidewalks. The cops looked on; no runner lasted long who didn't, out of his pocket,put in a free "figger" for his working area's foot cops, and it was generally known that the numbersbankers paid off at higher levels of the police department. 
哈莱姆的数字行业每到早晨和下午早些时候就会运转起来，跑腿的人在公寓楼的走廊、酒吧、理发店、商店、人行道上奔跑着，将人们的赌注记在纸片上。警察们也在场观察；没有一个跑得长久的跑腿者不从口袋里掏出一些钱来“贿赂”他所在地区的巡警，而且大家都知道数字银行家通常会向更高级别的警察部门支付贿赂。
The daily small army of runners each got ten percent of the money they turned in, along with thebet slips, to their controllers. (And if you hit, you gave the runner a ten percent tip.) A controllermight have as many as fifty runners working for him, and the controller got five percent of what heturned over to the banker, who paid off the hit, paid off the police, and got rich off the balance. 
每天跑腿的小队成员会得到他们所交纳赌注的十分之一，连同赌单一起交给他们的控制者。如果你赢了，你会给跑腿人十分之一的小费。一个控制者可能有多达50个为他工作的跑腿人，而控制者从他交给银行家的钱中获得五分之一的收益，银行家支付胜利、警察，并从余额中获利丰厚。
Some people played one number all year. Many had lists of the daily hit numbers going back foryears; they figured reappearance odds, and used other systems. Others played their hunches:addresses, license numbers of passing cars, any numbers on letters, telegrams, laundry slips,numbers from anywhere. Dream books that cost a dollar would say what number nearly anydream suggested. Evangelists who on Sundays peddled Jesus, and mystics, would pray a luckynumber for you, for a fee.Recently, the last three numbers of the post office's new Zip Code for a postal district of Harlemhit, and one banker almost went broke. Let this very book circulate widely in the black ghettoes ofthe country, and-although I'm no longer a gambling person-I'd lay a small wager for your favoritecharity that millions of dollars would be bet by my poor, foolish black brothers and sisters upon,say, whatever happens to be the number of this page, or whatever is the total of the whole book'spages. 
有些人一年都在玩一个数字。许多人有每日胜利数字的列表，可以追溯到多年以前；他们计算重现概率，并使用其他系统。其他人则依靠他们的直觉：车牌号码、车辆许可证号码、信件、电报、洗衣单上的号码，以及任何地方的数字。售价一美元的梦想书会告诉你几乎任何一个梦所暗示的数字。周日传教士和神秘主义者会为你祈祷幸运数字，收取费用。最近，哈莱姆邮政区的邮政区的新邮政编码的最后三个数字命中了，一位银行家几乎破产了。让这本书在全国黑人贫民窟广泛流传，虽然我不再是一个赌徒-但我愿意为你们的慈善事业下小注，几百万甚至几千万的黑人兄弟姐妹们将会在这本书的某个页面或整本书的总页数上投注。
Every day in Small's Paradise Bar was fascinating to me. And from a Harlem point of view, Icouldn't have been in a more educational situation. Some of the ablest of New York's blackhustlers took a liking to me, and knowing that I still was green by their terms, soon began in apaternal way to "straighten Red out." 
在Small's Paradise酒吧的每一天对我来说都很迷人。从哈莱姆的角度来看，我不可能处于更有益的教育环境中。一些纽约最有能力的黑帮分子喜欢上了我，他们知道我还很嫩，很快就开始以一种父亲般的方式“纠正Red”。
Their methods would be indirect. A dark, businessman-looking West Indian often would sit at oneof my tables. One day when I brought his beer, he said, "Red, hold still a minute." He went overme with one of those yellow tape measures, and jotted figures in his notebook. When I came towork the next afternoon, one of the bartenders handed me a package. In it was an expensive,dark blue suit, conservatively cut. The gift was thoughtful, and the message clear. 
他们的方式是间接的。一个看起来像商人的黑人西印度人经常会坐在我的桌子旁。有一天，当我给他拿来啤酒时，他说：“Red,等一下。”他拿着一把黄色的卷尺来到我身边，并在他的笔记本上记下了数字。第二天下午我去上班时，一名调酒师递给了我一个包裹。里面是一件昂贵的深蓝色西装，剪裁保守得体。这个礼物很贴心，信息也很明确。
The bartenders let me know that this customer was one of the top executives of the fabulousForty Thieves gang. That was the gang of organized boosters, who would deliver, to order, in oneday, C.O.D., any kind of garment you desired. You would pay about one-third of the store's price. 
调酒师告诉我，这位顾客是Forty Thieves帮派的高管之一。这是一支有组织的推广组织，他们会按照你的要求在一天内送来你想要的任何衣服。你需要支付商店价格的三分之一左右。
I heard how they made mass hauls. A well-dressed member of the gang who wouldn't arousesuspicion by his manner would go into a selected store about closing time, hide somewhere, andget locked inside when the store closed.The police patrols would have been timed beforehand.After dark, he'd pack suits in bags, then turn off the burglar alarm, and use the telephone to call awaiting truck and crew. When the truck came, timed with the police patrols, it would be loadedand gone within a few minutes. I later got to know several members of the Forty Thieves. 
我听说了他们如何进行大规模的走私。这个帮派中的一个穿着得体且不会引起怀疑的成员会在关门前进入一家选定的商店，然后躲藏起来，等商店关闭后被锁在里面。警方巡逻会事先安排好时间。天黑后，他会把西装装进袋子里，然后关闭防盗警报，并使用电话呼叫等待的卡车和工作人员。当卡车到达时，与警方巡逻的时间相吻合，它会在几分钟内被装上并离开。后来我认识了几个Forty Thieves帮派的成员。
Plainclothes detectives soon were quietly identified to me, by a nod, a wink. Knowing the lawpeople in the area was elementary for the hustlers, and, like them, in time I would learn to sensethe presence of any police types. In late 1942, each of the military services had their civilian- dress eyes and ears picking up anything of interest to them, such as hustles being used to avoidthe draft, or who hadn't registered, or hustles that were being worked on servicemen. 
便衣侦探很快就通过点头和眨眼的方式悄悄地向我指明了身份。对于那些小偷来说，了解该地区的法律人员是很基本的，就像他们一样，我也很快学会了感知任何警察类型的存在。在1942年底，每个军种都有自己的平民服装眼睛和耳朵来收集对他们感兴趣的任何事情，比如小偷偷东西来逃避征兵、没有注册的人或为军人工作的人。
Longshoremen, or fences for them, would come into the bars selling guns, cameras, perfumes,watches, and the like, stolen from the shipping docks. These Negroes got what white- longshoreman thievery left over. Merchant marine sailors often brought in foreign items, bargains,and the best marijuana cigarettes to be had were made of the _gunja_ and _kisca_ that merchantsailors smuggled in from Africa and Persia. 
码头工人或他们的走私者会来到酒吧里出售枪支、相机、香水、手表等从货运码头偷来的物品。
In the daytime, whites were given a guarded treatment. Whites who came at night got a betterreception; the several Harlem nightclubs they patronized were geared to entertain and jive thenight white crowd to get their money. 
在白天，白人会得到受到保护的待遇。晚上来的白人则会得到更好的接待；他们光顾的几个哈莱姆夜总会旨在娱乐和让夜间的白人群体狂欢以获取他们的钱财。
And with so many law agencies guarding the "morals" of servicemen, any of them that came in,and a lot did, were given what they asked for, and were spoken to if they spoke, and that was all,unless someone knew them as natives of Harlem. 
由于有如此多的执法机构保护着士兵的“道德”，任何进入酒吧的人，而且有很多人这样做，都会得到他们所要求的物品，如果他们说话也会被回应，但除此之外就没有什么了。除非有人认识他们是哈莱姆本地人。
What I was learning was the hustling society's first rule; that you never trusted anyone outside ofyour own closemouthed circle, and that you selected withtime and care before you made anyintimates even among these. 
我所学到的是哈莱姆小偷社会的首要规则：永远不要相信你圈子之外的任何人，并且在与这些人建立亲密关系之前，要花时间和精力仔细选择。
The bartenders would let me know which among the regular customers were mostly "fronts," andwhich really had something going; which were really in the underworld, with downtown police orpolitical connections; which really handled some money, and which were making it from day today; which were the real gamblers, and which had just hit a little luck; and which ones never torun afoul of in any way. 
调酒师们会告诉我哪些常客主要是“假身份”，哪些真的有生意可做；哪些真正在下层社会，与市中心警察或政治关系密切；哪些真正处理一些钱，并且是每天都在赚钱的；哪些是真正的赌徒，哪些只是碰巧运气好；以及哪些人绝对不能得罪。
The latter were extremely well known about Harlem, and they were feared and respected. It wasknown that if upset, they would break open your head and think nothing of it. These were old- timers, not to be confused with the various hotheaded, wild, young hustlers out trying to make aname for themselves for being crazy with a pistol trigger or a knife. The old heads that I'm talkingabout were such as "Black Sammy," "Bub" Hewlett, "King" Padmore and "West Indian Archie."Most of these tough ones had worked as strongarm men for Dutch Schultz back when hemuscled into the Harlem numbers industry after white gangsters had awakened to the fortunesbeing made in what they had previously considered "nigger pennies"; and the numbers game wasreferred to by the white racketeers as "nigger pool." 
后者在哈莱姆地区非常有名，他们既受人尊敬又令人畏惧。人们都知道，如果他们生气了，会打碎你的头而毫不在意。这些是老一辈的人，不要与各种易怒、狂野的年轻小偷混淆，他们只是为了在手枪扳机或刀子上发疯而出名。我所提到的老一辈人包括“Black Sammy”，“Bub” Hewlett,“King” Padmore和“West Indian Archie”。大多数这些强硬的人曾经是荷兰舒尔茨手下的保镖，当他进入哈莱姆的黑帮行业时，白帮派意识到在这个以前被认为是“黑奴零钱”的领域中可以赚到大把的钱；而这个数字游戏被白帮派称为“黑奴赌局”。
Those tough Negroes' heyday had been before the big 1931 Seabury Investigation that startedDutch Schultz on the way out, until his career ended with his 1934 assassination. I heard storiesof how they had "persuaded" people with lead pipes, wet cement, baseball bats, brass knuckles,fists, feet, and blackjacks. 
那些强硬的黑人在其巅峰时期是在1931年的Seabury调查之前，该调查导致荷兰舒尔茨开始走下坡路，直到他在1934年被暗杀结束职业生涯。我听说过他们如何用铅管、水泥、棒球棒、铜指节、拳头、脚和黑杰克“说服”人们。
Nearly every one of them had done some time, and had come back on the scene, and since hadworked as top runners for the biggest bankers who specialized in large bettors. 
几乎每个人都曾坐过牢，但他们又回来了。自那以后，他们一直在为最大的银行家工作，这些银行家专门处理大赌徒的业务。
There seemed to be an understanding that these Negroes and the tough blackcops neverclashed; I guess both knew that someone would die. They had some bad black cops in Harlem,too. The Four Horsemen that worked Sugar Hill-I remember the worst one had freckles-there wasa tough quartet. The biggest, blackest, worst cop of them all in Harlem was the West Indian,Brisbane. Negroes crossed the street to avoid him when he walked his 125th Street and SeventhAvenue beat. When I was in prison, someone brought me a story that Brisbane had been shot todeath by a scared, nervous young kid who hadn't been up from the South long enough to realizehow bad Brisbane was. 
似乎有一种默契，这些黑人和黑帮警察不会发生冲突；我想他们都明白有人会死。哈莱姆也有一些不好的黑人警察。在Sugar Hill工作的四匹黑马中，我记得最凶狠的一匹有雀斑-他们是一伙强硬的家伙。在哈莱姆，最大的、最黑、最凶残的警察是西印度群岛来的布里斯班。当布里斯班走过125街和第七大道时，黑人会躲开他以免被抓。当我在监狱里时，有人给我讲了一个故事，说布里斯班被一个害怕、紧张的年轻人开枪打死了，这个年轻人还没有从南方长时间生活过来，不知道布里斯班有多凶恶。
The world's most unlikely pimp was "Cadillac" Drake. He was shiny baldheaded, built like afootball; he used to call his huge belly "the chippies' playground." Cadillac had a string of about adozen of the stringiest, scrawniest, black and white street prostitutes in Harlem. Afternoonsaround the bar, the old-timers who knew Cadillac well enough would tease him about how womenwho looked like his made enough to feed themselves, let alone him. He'd roar with laughter rightalong with us; I can hear him now, "Bad-looking women work harder." 
世界上最不寻常的皮条客是“凯迪拉克”德雷克。他光头闪闪发亮，身材像个足球；他曾把他巨大的肚子称为“黑帮的操场”。凯迪拉克拥有一串约十几名最瘦、最黑、黑白混血的街头妓女。下午在酒吧里，那些熟悉凯迪拉克的人会取笑他说，长得像他的女人足以养活自己，更不用说他自己了。他会和我们一起大笑；我现在还能听到他的声音：“长相不好看的女人工作更努力。”
Just about the complete opposite of Cadillac was the young, smooth, independent-acting pimp,"Sammy the Pimp." He could, as I have mentioned, pick out potential prostitutes by watching theirexpressions in dance halls. Sammy and I became, in time, each other's closest friend. Sammy,who was from Kentucky, was a cool, collected expert in his business, and his business waswomen. Like Cadillac, he too had both black and white women out making his living, but Sammy'swomen-who would come into Small's sometimes, looking for him, to give him money, and havehim buy them a drink-were about as beautiful as any prostitutes who operated anywhere, I'dimagine. 
与凯迪拉克截然相反的是年轻的、圆滑的独立皮条客“萨米皮条客”。正如我所提到的，他可以通过观察舞厅里的表情来挑选潜在的妓女。萨米和我成为了彼此最亲密的朋友。萨米来自肯塔基州，是一个冷静、专业且精通业务的专家，他的业务就是女人。和凯迪拉克一样，他也同时拥有黑人和白人的女性为他谋生，但萨米的女人们-有时会来到Small's,找他要钱，让他请她们喝酒-在我看来，和任何地方的妓女一样美丽。
One of his white women, known as "Alabama Peach," a blonde, could put everybody in stitcheswith her drawl; even the several Negro women numbers controllers around Small's really likedher. What made a lot of Negroes aroundthe bar laugh the hardest was the way she would takethree syllables to say "nigger." But what she usually was saying was "Ah jes' lu-uv ni-uh-guhs-."Give her two drinks and she would tell her life story in a minute; how in whatever little Alabamatown it was she came from, the first thing she remembered being conscious of was that she wassupposed to "hate niggers." And then she started hearing older girls in grade school whisperingthe hush-hush that "niggers" were such sexual giants and athletes, and she started growing upsecretly wanting to try one. Finally, right in her own house, with her family away, she threatened aNegro man who worked for her father that if he didn't take her she would swear he tried rape. Hehad no choice, except that he quit working for them. And from then until she finished high school,she managed it several times with other Negroes-and she somehow came to New York, and wentstraight to Harlem. Later on, Sammy told me how he had happened to spot her in the Savoy, noteven dancing with anybody, just standing on the sidelines, watching, and he could tell. And onceshe really went for Negroes, the more the better, Sammy said, and wouldn't have a white man. Ihave wondered what ever became of her. 
他的一位白人女性，被称为“阿拉巴马桃子”，是一个金发碧眼的人，她独特的口音能让每个人都捧腹大笑；甚至在Smalls周围的几位黑人女性数字控制器也非常喜欢她。让酒吧里许多黑人最开心的是，她会花三秒钟时间说“nigger”，但实际上她说的是“Ah jes' lu-uv ni-uh-guhs-”。给她两杯酒，她会在一分钟内讲述自己的人生故事；无论她来自哪个小阿拉巴马城，她记得的第一件事就是她应该“恨黑鬼”。然后她开始听到小学年级的女孩们私下里低声谈论“黑鬼”是如此的性巨人和运动员，她开始悄悄地渴望尝试一下。最后，就在她自己家里，在她家人离开的时候，她威胁一个为她父亲工作的黑人男子，如果他不带她走，她就会发誓他试图强奸她。他别无选择，只能辞去工作。从那时起直到她完成高中学业，她在其他黑人身上成功了几次-然后她不知怎么来到了纽约，直接去了哈莱姆区。后来，萨米告诉我，他偶然在萨伏伊发现了她，她没有和任何人跳舞，只是站在一旁观看，他能看出来。一旦她真的对黑人感兴趣，越多越好，萨米说，她不会要白人男人。我一直想知道她后来怎么样了。
There was a big, fat pimp we called "Dollarbill." He loved to flash his "Kansas City roll," probablyfifty one-dollar bills folded with a twenty on the inside and a one-hundred dollar bill on the outside.We always wondered what Dollarbill would do if someone ever stole his hundred-dollar "cover." 
有一个我们称之为“美元钞票”的大胖子皮条客。他喜欢炫耀他的“堪萨斯城卷”，可能是将五十一张一美元的钞票叠在一起，里面夹着一张二十美元和一张一百美元的钞票。我们总是好奇如果有人偷走了他的一百美元“保护套”，美元钞票会怎么做。
A man who, in his prime, could have stolen Dollarbill's whole roll, blindfolded, was threadbare,comic old "Fewclothes." Fewclothes had been one of the best pickpockets in Harlem, back whenthe white people swarmed up every night in the 1920's, but then during the Depression, he hadcontracted a bad case of arthritis in his hands. His finger joints were knotted and gnarled so that itmade people uncomfortable to look at them. Rain, sleet, or snow, every afternoon, about six,Fewclothes would be at Small's, telling tall tales about the old days, and it was one of the day'srituals for one or another regular customer to ask the bartender to give him drinks, and me to feedhim. 
一个男人，在他最鼎盛的时候，即使闭着眼睛也能偷走美元钞票的整个卷轴，他就是破旧、滑稽的老“Fewclothes”。Fewclothes曾经是哈莱姆最好的扒手之一，当时白人晚上成群结队地涌入，但在经济萧条期间，他的手患上了严重的关节炎。他的手指关节扭曲、结痂，让人看了很不舒服。每天下午六点左右，不管是雨、雪还是冰雹，Fewclothes都会来到Small's,讲述过去的传奇故事。这是一天中某个常客向酒保要饮料和喂我食物的仪式之一。
My heart goes out to all of us who in those afternoons at Small's enacted our scene withFewclothes. I wish you could have seen him, pleasantly "high" with drinks, take his seat withdignity-no begging, not on anybody's Welfare-and open his napkin, and study the day's menu thatI gave nun, and place his order. I'd tell the cooks it was Fewclothes and he'd get the best in thehouse. I'd go back and serve it as though he were a millionaire. 
我为我们在Small's与Fewclothes一起度过的那些下午感到难过。我希望你能看见他，愉快地“喝高了”饮料，以尊严的方式坐下-不是乞讨，也不是靠任何人的福利-打开他的餐巾，研究我给他的当天的菜单，并下订单。我会告诉厨师这是Fewclothes,他会得到最好的菜肴。我会回去像对待百万富翁一样为他服务。
Many times since, I have thought about it, and what it really meant. In one sense, we werehuddled in there, bonded together in seeking security and warmth and comfort from each other,and we didn't know it. All of us-who might have probed space, or cured cancer, or built industries- were, instead, black victims of the white man's American social system. In another sense, thetragedy of the once master pickpocket made him, for those brother old-timer hustlers, a "there butfor the grace of God" symbol. To wolves who still were able to catch some rabbits, it had meaningthat an old wolf who had lost his fangs was still eating. 
从那以后，我多次想过它的意义。从某种意义上说，我们聚集在那里，相互联系在一起，寻求彼此的安全、温暖和舒适，而我们不知道这一点。我们所有人-那些可能探索太空、治愈癌症或建立产业的人-实际上都是白人美国社会制度下的黑人受害者。在另一种意义上，曾经的大师级扒手的悲剧使他成为那些老江湖们的“幸亏有上帝眷顾”的象征。对于仍然能够捕到一些兔子的狼来说，这意味着一只失去犬齿的老狼仍然在进食。
Then there was the burglar, "Jumpsteady." In the ghettoes the white man has built for us, he hasforced us not to aspire to greater things, but to view everyday living as survival-and in that kind ofa community, survival is what is respected. In any average white neighborhood bar, you couldn'timagine a known cat-man thief regularly exposing himself, as one of the most popular people inthere. But if Jumpsteady missed a few days running in Small's, we would begin inquiring for him. 
然后是小偷“跳跃稳定”。在白人为我们建造的贫民窟里，他们迫使我们不要追求更高的目标，而是将日常生活视为生存-在这种社区中，生存才是受尊重的。在任何普通的白人社区酒吧里，你无法想象一个著名的猫贼经常暴露自己，成为那里最受欢迎的人之一。但是如果Jumpsteady在Small's缺勤几天，我们就会开始寻找他。
Jumpsteady was called that because, it was said, when he worked in white residential areasdowntown, he jumped from roof to roof and was so steady that he maneuvered along windowledges, leaning, balancing, edging with his toes. If he fell, he'd have been dead. He got intoapartments through windows. It wassaid that he was so cool that he had stolen even with peoplein the next room. I later found out that Jumpsteady always keyed himself up high on dope whenhe worked. He taught me some things that I was to employ in later years when hard times wouldforce me to have my own burglary ring. 
Jumpsteady这个名字是因为，据说当他在市中心的白人居民区工作时，他能够从屋顶跳到屋顶，非常稳定，能够在窗台上移动、倾斜、平衡、用脚趾边缘。如果他摔倒了，他就会死。他通过窗户进入公寓。据说他非常酷，甚至可以在隔壁房间偷东西。后来我发现Jumpsteady在工作时总是让自己处于高度兴奋状态。他教给我一些东西，在我后来的艰难岁月里需要我组建自己的盗窃团伙时派上了用场。
I should stress that Small's wasn't any nest of criminals. I dwell upon the hustlers because it wastheir world that fascinated me. Actually, for the night-life crowd, Small's was one of Harlem's twoor three most decorous nightspots. In fact, the New York City police department recommendedSmall's to white people who would ask for a "safe" place in Harlem. 
我应该强调的是，Small's并不是犯罪者的聚集地。我之所以关注这些扒手，是因为他们的世界让我着迷。实际上，对于夜生活人群来说，Small's是Harlem的两三个最优雅的夜店之一。事实上，纽约市警察局向那些在Harlem寻找“安全”场所的白人推荐了Small's。
The first room I got after I left the railroad (half of Harlem roomed) was in the 800 block of St.Nicholas Avenue. You could walk into one or another room in this house and get a hot fur coat, agood camera, fine perfume, a gun, anything from hot women to hot cars, even hot ice. I was oneof the very few males in this rooming house. This was during the war, when you couldn't turn onthe radio and not hear about Guadalcanal or North Africa. In several of the apartments thewomen tenants were prostitutes. The minority were in some other racket or hustle-boosters,numbers runners, or dope-peddlers-and I'd guess that everyone who lived in the house useddope of some kind. This shouldn't reflect too badly on that particular building, because almosteveryone in Harlem needed some kind of hustle to survive, and needed to stay high in some wayto forget what they had to do to survive. 
我离开铁路局之后，住的第一个房间是在圣尼古拉斯大道800号的房间里。你可以走进这个房子里的任何一个房间，都能拿到一件热毛皮大衣、一台好相机、上等香水、一把枪，从热门的女人到热门的汽车，甚至热门的冰块。我是这个寄宿公寓里极少数的男性之一。这是在战争期间，当时你不能打开收音机，否则就会听到关于瓜达卡纳尔岛或北非的消息。在这个公寓里，有些女性租客是妓女。少数人从事其他骗局或促进者、号码推销员或毒品贩子-我想每个人都住在那栋房子里的人都使用某种毒品。这不应该对那个特定的建筑产生太大的影响，因为几乎每个在Harlem的人都需要某种形式的谋生方式来生存，并且需要以某种方式保持高度以忘记他们为了生存所必须做的事情。
It was in this house that I learned more about women than I ever did in any other single place. Itwas these working prostitutes who schooled me to things that every wife and every husbandshould know. Later on, it was chiefly the women who weren't prostitutes who taught me to be verydistrustful of most women; there seemed to be a higher code of ethics and sisterliness amongthose prostitutes than among numerous ladies of the church who have more men for kicks thanthe prostitutes have for pay. And I am talking about both black andwhite. Many of the black onesin those wartime days were right in step with the white ones in having husbands fighting overseaswhile they were laying up with other men, even giving them their husbands' money. And manywomen just faked as mothers and wives, while playing the field as hand as prostitutes-with theirhusbands and children right there in New York.I got my first schooling about the cesspool morals of the white man from the best possible source,from his own women. And then as I got deeper into my own life of evil, I saw the white man'smorals with my own eyes. I even made my living helping to guide him to the sick things hewanted. 
正是在这个房子里，我学到了比其他任何地方都更多关于女性的知识。这些工作妓女教会了我所有妻子和丈夫都应该知道的事情。后来，主要是那些不是妓女的女人教我对大多数女性非常不信任；在那些妓女中似乎有一种更高的道德准则和姐妹情谊，而那些教堂里的女人则更注重男人的娱乐而不是妓女的收入。我指的是黑人和白人。在那些战争时期，许多黑人的丈夫都在海外战斗，而她们却在和其他男人约会，甚至把丈夫的钱交给他们。许多女人假装是母亲和妻子，同时像妓女一样玩弄着她们的丈夫和孩子-就在纽约。我从他自己的妇女那里得到了关于白人肮脏道德的最佳教育来源。然后当我深入自己邪恶的生活时，我亲眼看到了白人的道德观。我甚至以帮助引导他走向他想要的那些堕落的事情为生。
I was young, working in the bar, not bothering with these women. Probably I touched their kid- brother instincts, something like that. Some would drop into my room when they weren't busy, andwe would smoke reefers and talk. It generally would be after their morning rush-but let me tell youabout that rush. 
我当时还年轻，在酒吧工作，没有去理会这些女人。可能我触动了她们的母性本能，类似这样的东西。有些人会在他们不忙的时候来到我的房间，我们会抽烟和聊天。通常是在早上忙碌之后-但让我告诉你关于那个忙碌的情况。
Seeing the hallways and stairs busy any hour of the night with white and black men coming andgoing was no more than one would expect when one lived in a building out of which prostituteswere working. But what astonished me was the full-house crowd that rushed in between, say, sixand seven-thirty in the morning, then rushed away, and by about nine, I would be the only man inthe house. 
在晚上的任何时候，看到走廊和楼梯上挤满了白人和黑人男人来来去去，这并不比住在一个妓女工作的地方更令人惊讶。但令我惊讶的是，在早上六七点钟的时候，人群涌入，然后又在九点左右匆匆离开，到那时，我已经是房子里唯一的男人了。
It was husbands-who had left home in time to stop by this St. Nicholas Avenue house before theywent on to work. Of course not the same ones every day, but always enough of them to make upthe rush. And it included white men who had come in cabs all the way up from downtown. 
这是那些及时离开家去工作的丈夫们在前往工作之前顺便来这个圣尼古拉斯大道的公寓。当然，每天的不是同一批人，但总是有足够的人组成了高峰期。其中还包括从市中心坐出租车过来的白人男性。
Domineering, complaining, demanding wives who had just about psychologically castrated theirhusbands were responsible for the early rush. These wives were so disagreeable and had madetheir men so tense that they were robbed of the satisfaction of being men. To escape this tensionand the chance of being ridiculed by his own wife, each of these men had gotten up early andcome to a prostitute. 
那些霸道、抱怨、要求苛刻的妻子们对早高峰负责。这些妻子们非常不讨人喜欢，让她们的男人感到紧张不安，以至于失去了做男人的满足感。为了摆脱这种紧张和被自己的妻子嘲笑的机会，每个男人都早早起床去找妓女。
The prostitutes had to make it their business to be students of men. They said that after mostmen passed their virile twenties, they went to bed mainly to satisfy their egos, and because a lotof women don't understand it that way, they damage and wreck a man's ego. No matter how littlevirility a man has to offer, prostitutes make him feel for a time that he is the greatest man in theworld. That's why these prostitutes had that morning rush of business. More wives could keeptheir husbands if they realized their greatest urge is _to be men_. 
妓女们必须成为男人的学生。
Those women would tell me anything. Funny little stories about the bedroom differences they sawbetween white and black men. The perversities! I thought I had heard the whole range ofperversities until I later became a steerer taking white men to what they wanted. Everyone in thehouse laughed about the little Italian fellow whom they called the "Ten Dollar A Minute Man." Hecame without fail every noontime, from his little basement restaurant up near the Polo Grounds;the joke was he never lasted more than two minutes. . . but he always left twenty dollars. 
那些女人什么都会告诉我。关于他们看到的白人和黑人之间的卧室差异的有趣小故事。变态！我以为我已经听到了所有的反常行为，直到我后来成为一名舵手，带领白人去他们想要的地方。房子里的每个人都嘲笑那个被他们称为“一分钟十美元的人”的意大利小家伙，他每天中午都会从他在马球场附近的地下室小餐馆里出来，从不间断；笑话是他从来没有坚持超过两分钟。但他总是留下二十美元。
Most men, the prostitutes felt, were too easy to push around. Every day these prostitutes heardtheir customers complaining that they never heard anything but griping from women who werebeing taken care of and given everything. The prostitutes said that most men needed to knowwhat the pimps knew. A woman should occasionally be babied enough to show her the man hadaffection, but beyond that she should be treated firmly. These tough women said that it workedwith _them_. All women, by their nature, are fragile and weak: they are attracted to the male inwhom they see strength.*     *     * 
妓女们觉得，大多数男人都太容易被摆布了。每天，这些妓女听到她们的顾客抱怨说，他们只听到女人的抱怨和不满，却没有听到任何积极的声音。妓女们说，大多数男人需要知道皮条客知道的东西。一个女人应该偶尔表现得足够娇惯，以显示她对男人有感情，但除此之外，她应该受到坚定的对待。这些坚强的女人说这对他们有效。所有女人天生都是脆弱和软弱的：她们被男性中的力量所吸引。
From time to time, Sophia would come over to see me from Boston. Even among HarlemNegroes, her looks gave me status. They were just like the Negroes everywhere else. That waswhy the white prostitutes made so much money. It didn't make any difference if you were inLansing, Boston, or New York-what the white racist said, and still says, was right in those days!All you had to do was put a white girl anywhere close to the average black man, and he wouldrespond. The black woman also made the white man's eyes light up-but he was slick enough tohide it. 
有时候，索菲亚会从波士顿来看我。即使是在哈莱姆的黑人中，她的美貌也让我显得有地位。他们和其他地方的黑人一样。这就是为什么白人妓女们赚了很多钱的原因。不管你在哪里-无论是兰辛、波士顿还是纽约-当时的白人种族主义者所说的都是正确的！你只需要把一个白人女孩放在任何一个接近普通黑人的附近，他就会回应。黑人女性也会让白人男性的目光变得明亮-但他足够狡猾，可以隐藏它。
Sophia would come in on a late afternoon train. She would come to Small's and I'd introduce heraround until I got off from work. She was bothered about me living among the prostitutes until Iintroduced her to some of them, and they talked, and she thought they were great. They wouldtell her they were keeping me straight for her. We would go to the Braddock Hotel bar, where wewould meet some of the musicians who now would greet me like an old friend, "Hey, Red-whohave we got here?" They would make a big deal over her; I couldn't even think about buying adrink. No Negroes in the world were more white-woman-crazy in those days than most of thosemusicians. People in show business, of course, were less inhibited by social and racial taboos. 
索菲亚会在下午晚些时候乘坐火车来到。她会来到小酒店，我会介绍她认识周围的人，直到我下班离开。她一直担心我住在妓女中间，直到我向她介绍了一些妓女，她们交谈，她觉得她们很了不起。他们会告诉她他们在帮我保持清醒。我们会去布拉德克酒店的酒吧，在那里我们会遇到一些音乐家，现在他们会像老朋友一样问候我：“嘿，红人-我们有什么客人？”他们对她非常重视；我甚至都不敢考虑买一杯饮料。在那些日子里，没有哪个黑人在对白人女性的痴迷上比这些音乐家更甚的了。当然，在演艺圈里的人对社会和种族禁忌的抑制要少得多。
The white racist won't tell you that it also works in reverse. When it got late, Sophia and I wouldgo to some of the after-hours places and speakeasies. When the downtown nightclubs hadclosed, most of these Harlem places crawled with white people. These whites were just mad forNegro "atmosphere," especially some of the places which had what you might call Negro soul.Sometimes Negroes would talk about how a lot of whites seemed unable to have enough of beingclose around us, and among us-in groups. Both white men and women, it seemed, would getalmost mesmerized by Negroes.I remember one really peculiar case of this-a white girl who never missed a single night in theSavoy Ballroom. She fascinated my friend Sammy; he had watched her several times. Dancingonly with Negroes, she seemed to go nearly into a trance. If a white man asked her to dance, shewould refuse. Then when the place was ready to close, early in the morning, she would let aNegro take her as far as the subway entrance. And that was it. She never would tell anyone hername, let alone reveal where she lived. 
白人种族主义者不会告诉你，这也是一种反向的情况。当夜深人静时，索菲亚和我就会去一些夜店和地下酒吧。当市中心的夜总会关闭时，这些哈莱姆地区的场所都挤满了白人。这些人只是对黑人的“氛围”感到疯狂，尤其是那些被称为黑人灵魂的地方。有时候黑人会谈论很多白人似乎无法忍受与我们接近，尤其是在一群人中。无论是男性还是女性，似乎都会被黑人迷住。我记得一个非常奇特的例子-一个白人女孩从未错过萨沃舞厅的任何一晚。她吸引了我的朋友萨米；他看了她好几次。只和黑人跳舞，她似乎几乎进入了一种恍惚状态。如果一个白人邀请她跳舞，她会拒绝。然后当这个地方准备关闭时，早上很早的时候，她会让一个黑人把她送到地铁入口。这就是全部了。她从不告诉任何人她的名字，更不用说透露她住在哪里了。
Now, I'll tell you another peculiar case that worked out differently, and which taught me somethingI have since learned in a thousand other ways. This was my best early lesson in how most whitemen's hearts and guts will turn over inside of them, whatever they may have you otherwisebelieve, whenever they see a Negro man on close terms with a white woman. 
现在，我要告诉你另一个不同寻常的例子，它教会了我一些后来在其他地方学到的东西。这是我早期关于大多数白人内心和勇气的最好的教训，无论他们之前相信什么，只要看到一个黑人男子与一个白人女子关系密切，他们的内心就会翻转。
A few of the white men around Harlem, younger ones whom we called "hippies," acted moreNegro than Negroes. This particular one talked more "hip" talk than we did. He would have foughtanyone who suggested he felt any race difference. Musicians around the Braddock could hardlymove without falling over him. Every time I saw him, it was "Daddy! Come on, let's get our headstight!" Sammy couldn't stand him; he was underfoot wherever you went. He even wore a wild zootsuit, used a heavy grease in his hair to make it look like a conk, and he wore the knob-toedshoes, the long, swinging chain-everything. And he not only wouldn't be seen with any woman buta black one, but in fact he lived with two of them in the same little apartment. I never was surehow they worked that one out, but I had my idea. 
在哈莱姆区，有一些年轻的白人男性，我们称之为“嬉皮士”，他们的行为比黑人还要像黑人。其中一个人说的话比我们说的“时髦”话更多。他会和任何人打架，只要有人提出他有种族差异的感觉。布拉德克附近的音乐家们几乎都无法避免和他碰撞。每次我看到他，都是“爸爸！快点，让我们把头扎紧！”萨米受不了他；无论你去哪里，他都在你脚下。他甚至穿着一件疯狂的奇诺西装，用厚重的发油把它弄成一个卷发，还穿着大头鞋、长长的摇摆链-一切都是这样。他不仅不会和任何女人在一起，而且只和黑人在一起，事实上他和两个黑人住在同一个小公寓里。我从来没有确定过他们是如何解决这个问题的，但我有自己的想法。
About three or four o'clock one morning, we ran into this white boy, in Creole Bill's speakeasy. Hewas high-in that marijuana glow where the world relaxes. I introduced Sophia; I went away to sayhello to someone else. When I returned, Sophia looked peculiar-but she wouldn't tell me until weleft. He had askedher, "Why is a white girl like you throwing yourself away with a spade?" 
大约在凌晨三四点钟，我们在克里奥耳·比尔的地下酒吧遇到了这个白人男孩。
Creole Bill-naturally you know he was from New Orleans-became another good friend of mine.After Small's closed, I'd bring fast-spending white people who still wanted some drinking action toCreole Bill's speakeasy. That was my earliest experience at steering. The speakeasy was onlyCreole Bill's apartment. I think a partition had been knocked out to make the living room larger.But the atmosphere, plus the food, made the place one of Harlem's soul spots. 
克里奥耳·比尔-当然，你知道他来自新奥尔良-成为了我的另一个好朋友。在小酒店关闭后，我会带着那些仍然想要一些饮酒活动的花钱如流水的白人去克里奥耳·比尔的地下酒吧。这是我最早的引导经验。地下酒吧只是克里奥耳·比尔的公寓。我认为一个隔板被敲掉了，以使起居室变得更大。但气氛，再加上食物，使这个地方成为哈莱姆的灵魂之地之一。
A record player maintained the right, soft music. There was any kind of drink. And Bill sold platesof his spicy, delicious Creole dishes-gumbo, jambalaya. Bill's girl friend-a beautiful black girl- served the customers. Bill called her "Brown Sugar," and finally everyone else did. If a goodnumber of customers were to be served at one time, Creole Bill would bring out some pots,Brown Sugar would bring the plates, and Bill would serve everyone big platefuls; and he'd heap aplate for himself and eat with us. It was a treat to watch him eat; he loved his food so; it wasgood. Bill could cook rice like the Chinese-I mean rice that stood every grain on its own, but Inever knew the Chinese to do what Bill could with seafood and beans. 
一台唱片机播放着轻柔的音乐。有各种各样的饮料。比尔还卖着他的美味辣味克里奥尔菜肴-gumbo、jambalaya等。比尔的女朋友，一个漂亮的黑人女孩，为顾客服务。比尔称她为“红糖”，最终其他人也这样称呼她。如果一次要为很多顾客提供服务，克里奥耳·比尔会拿出一些锅，红糖会带来盘子，比尔会为大家盛一大盘；他也会为自己盛一盘，和我们一起吃。看着他吃饭是一种享受；他非常喜欢他的饭菜；很好吃。比尔可以像中国人一样煮米饭-我的意思是米饭上每粒米都独立站立，但我从不知道中国人能像比尔那样用海鲜和豆类做菜。
Bill made money enough in that apartment speakeasy to open up a Creole restaurant famous inHarlem. He was a great baseball fan. All over the walls were framed, autographed photographs ofmajor league stars, and also some political and show business celebrities who would come thereto eat, bringing friends. I wonder what's become of Creole Bill? His place is sold, and I haven'theard anything of him. I must remember to ask some of the Seventh Avenue old-timers, whowould know. 
比尔在那个地下酒吧的收入足够开一家著名的克里奥尔餐厅，在哈莱姆很有名。他是个棒球迷。墙上挂满了各种签名照片，有大联盟明星、政治和演艺界名人的，他们会带着朋友去那里吃饭。我想知道克里奥耳·比尔现在怎么样了？他的店被卖了，我没有听到任何关于他的消息。我必须记得问问第七大道的老前辈们，他们可能知道。
Once, when I called Sophia in Boston, she said she couldn't get away until the followingweekend. She had just married some well-to-do Boston white fellow. He was in the service, hehad been home on leave, and he had just goneback. She didn't mean it to change a thingbetween us. I told her it made no difference. I had of course introduced Sophia to my friendSammy, and we had gone out together some nights. And Sammy and I had thoroughly discussedthe black man and white woman psychology. I had Sammy to thank that I was entirely preparedfor Sophia's marriage. 
有一次，我打电话给波士顿的索菲亚，她说她下周才能离开。她刚刚嫁给了一个富有的波士顿白人。他正在服役中，已经回家休假了，现在又回去了。她并不是想改变我们之间的关系。我告诉她这没关系。当然，我已经把索菲亚介绍给了我的朋友萨米，我们有几个晚上一起出去。萨米和我彻底讨论了黑人和白人之间的心理学。我要感谢萨米，因为我完全准备好了索菲亚的婚姻。
Sammy said that white women were very practical; he had heard so many of them express howthey felt. They knew that the black man had all the strikes against him, that the white man keptthe black man down, under his heel, unable to get anywhere, really. The white woman wanted tobe comfortable, she wanted to be looked upon with favor by her own kind, but also she wanted tohave her pleasure. So some of them just married a white man for convenience and security, andkept right on going with a Negro. It wasn't that they were necessarily in love with the Negro, butthey were in love with lust-particularly "taboo" lust. 
萨米说，白人女性很实际；他听过很多她们表达自己的感受。他们知道黑人男人有很多不利因素，白人男人一直压制黑人男人，使他无法前进。白人女人想要舒适，想要得到自己同类的青睐，但同时也想要满足自己的欲望。所以一些人只是为了方便和安全而嫁给了白人男人，并继续与黑人在一起。这并不是说她们一定爱上了黑人，而是她们爱上了欲望-特别是“禁忌”的欲望。
A white man was not too unusual if he had a ten-, twenty-, thirty-, forty-, or fifty-thousand-dollar-a- year job. A Negro man who made even five thousand in the white man's world was unusual. Thewhite woman with a Negro man would be with him for one of two reasons: either extremelyinsane love, or to satisfy her lust. 
如果一个白人男人有一份年薪十万、二十万、三十万、四十万或五十万美元的工作，那并不稀奇。在白人的世界里，一个黑人男人赚得哪怕只有五万美元也是不寻常的。一个白人女人和一个黑人男人在一起，要么是因为极度疯狂的爱情，要么是为了满足她的欲望。
When I had been around Harlem long enough to show signs of permanence, inevitably I got anickname that would identify me beyond any confusion with two other red-conked and well-known"Reds" who were around. I had met them both; in fact, later on I'd work with them both. One, "St.Louis Red," was a professional armed robber. When I was sent to prison, he was serving time fortrying to stick up a dining car steward on a train between New York and Philadelphia. He wasfinally freed; now, I hear, he is in prison for a New York City jewel robbery. 
当我在哈莱姆待了足够长的时间，表现出永久定居的迹象时，不可避免地得到了一个绰号，这个绰号可以让我与其他两个著名的“红人”区别开来。我见过他们两个；事实上，后来我还和他们一起工作。其中一个叫“圣路易斯红”，是一名职业武装抢劫犯。当我被送进监狱时，他正在纽约和费城之间的火车上试图抢劫餐车服务员，当时他正服刑。他现在终于被释放了，据我所知，他因纽约市珠宝抢劫而被监禁。
 The other was "Chicago Red." We became good buddies in a speakeasy where later on I was awaiter; Chicago Red was the funniest dishwasher on this earth. Now he's making his living beingfunny as a nationally known stage and nightclub comedian. I don't see any reason why oldChicago Red would mind me telling that he is Redd Foxx. 
另一个是“芝加哥红”。我们在一个地下酒吧里成为了好朋友，后来我在那里当服务员；芝加哥红是这个地球上最有趣的洗碗工。现在他以在全国范围内著名的舞台和夜总会喜剧演员的身份谋生。我认为没有任何理由让老芝加哥红介意我说他是瑞德·福克斯。
Anyway, before long, my nickname happened. Just when, I don't know-but people, knowing I wasfrom Michigan, would ask me what city. Since most New Yorkers had never heard of Lansing, Iwould name Detroit. Gradually, I began to be called "Detroit Red"-and it stuck. 
不管怎样，不久之后，我的绰号就出现了。我不知道具体是什么时候-但是人们知道我来自密歇根州后，会问我是哪个城市。由于大多数纽约人从未听说过兰辛市，所以我就把“底特律”说成了“密歇根州”。渐渐地，我开始被称为“底特律红”，并且这个绰号一直沿用至今。

One afternoon in early 1943, before the regular six o'clock crowd had gathered, a black soldiersat drinking by himself at one of my tables. He must have been there an hour or more. He lookeddumb and pitiful and just u p from the Deep South. The fourth or fifth drink I served this soldier,wiping the table I bent over close and asked him if he wanted a woman. 
1943年初的一个下午，在六点钟的常规顾客到来之前，一个黑人士兵独自坐在我的一张桌子旁喝酒。他在那里至少呆了一个小时。他看起来愚蠢而可怜，就像是刚从南方来的。在我为这位士兵服务了第四或第五杯酒后，我擦拭着桌子弯下腰近距离地问他是否想要女人。
I knew better. It wasn't only Small's Paradise law, it was the law of every tavern that wanted tostay in business-never get involved with anything that could be interpreted as "impairing themorals" of servicemen, or any kind of hustling off them. This had caused trouble for dozens ofplaces: some had been put off limits by the military; some had lost their state or city licenses. 
我知道这其中的道理。这不仅仅是小天堂法律，而是每一个想要继续经营下去的酒吧都必须遵守的法律-绝不参与任何可能被解释为“损害士兵道德”的活动，或者任何形式的骗取他们的钱财。这已经给数十个地方带来了麻烦：一些被军方禁止进入；一些失去了州或城市许可证。
I played right into the hands of a military spy. He sure would like a woman. He acted so grateful.He even put on an extreme Southern accent. And I gave him the phone number of one of my bestfriends among the prostitutes where I lived. 
我被一个军事间谍利用了。他肯定想要女人。他表现得非常感激，甚至还模仿南方口音。我给了他我住处的妓女中最好的朋友的电话号码。
But something felt wrong. I gave the fellow a half-hour to get there, and then Itelephoned. Iexpected the answer I got-that no soldier had been there. 
但我感觉不对劲。我给了他半个小时的时间到达，然后我打电话过去。我得到的答案让我感到惊讶-没有士兵去过那里。
I didn't even bother to go back out to the bar. I just went straight to Charlie Small's office. 
我甚至没有回去酒吧。我只是直接去了查理·斯莫的办公室。
"I just d id something, Charlie," I said. "I don't know why I did it-" and I told him. 
“我刚刚做了件事情，查理。”我说，“我不知道为什么我这么做了-”然后我告诉他。
Charlie looked at me. "I wish you hadn't done that, Red." We both knew what he meant. 
查理看着我。“我希望你没有那样做，瑞德。”我们都知道他说的是什么意思。
When the West Indian plainclothes detective, Joe Baker, came in, I was waiting. I didn't even askhim any questions. When we got to the 135th Street precinct, it was busy with police in uniform,and MP's with soldiers in tow. I was recognized by some other detectives who, like Joe Baker,sometimes dropped in at Small's. 
当西印度群岛便衣侦探乔·贝克进入时，我正在等待。我甚至没有问他任何问题。当我们到达第135街派出所时，那里挤满了穿着制服的警察和带着士兵的国会议员。我和乔·贝克一样有时会光顾小天堂的几位侦探被一些人认出来了。
Two things were in my favor. I'd never given the police any trouble, and when that black spysoldier had tried to tip me, I had waved it away, telling him I was just doing him a favor. They musthave agreed that Joe Baker should just scare me. 
有两件事让我受益。我从来没有给警察惹过麻烦，当那个黑人间谍试图贿赂我时，我把他打发走了，告诉他我只是在帮他一个忙。他们肯定认为乔·贝克应该只是吓唬我一下。
I didn't know enough to be aware that I wasn't taken to the desk and booked. Joe Baker took meback inside of the precinct building, into a small room. In the next room, we could hear somebodygetting whipped. _Whop! W hop!_ He'd cry out, "Please! Please don't beat my face, that's how Imake my living!" I knew from that it was some pimp. _Whop! Whop!"_ Please! Please!" 
我不知道自己是否被带到前台并被登记。乔·贝克带我回到派出所大楼里，进入一个小房间。在隔壁的房间里，我们可以听到有人挨打的声音。“啪！啪！”他会大声呼喊：“请！请别打我的脸，那是我谋生的工具！”我知道那是一些皮条客。“啪！啪！”“请！请！”
(Not much later, I heard that Joe Baker had gotten trapped over in New Jersey, shaking down aNegro pimp and his white prostitute. He was discharged fromthe New York City police force, theState of New Jersey convicted him, and he went off to do some time.) 
(不久之后，我听说乔·贝克在新泽西州被困住了，他敲诈了一位黑人皮条客和他的白人妓女。他从纽约市警察局辞职，新泽西州对他定罪，然后去服刑。)
More bitter than getting fired, I was barred from Small's. I could understand. Even if I wasn'tactually what was called "hot," I was now going to be under surveillance-and the Small brothershad to protect their business. 
比被解雇更痛苦的是，我被禁止进入小天堂。我可以理解。即使我不是真正意义上的“热门”，我现在也要受到监视-而小兄弟们必须保护他们的生意。
Sammy proved to be my friend in need. He put the word on the wire for me to come over to hisplace. I had never been there. His place seemed to me a small palace; his women really kept himin style. While we talked about what kind of a hustle I should get into, Sammy gave me some ofthe best marijuana I'd ever used. 
萨米证明了我在困难时期的好朋友。他通过电话告诉我去他的地方。我从未去过那里。他的住所对我来说似乎是一个小型宫殿；
Various numbers controllers, Small's regulars, had offered me jobs as a runner. But that meant Iwould earn very little until I could build up a clientele. Pimping, as Sammy did, was out. I felt I hadno abilities in that direction, and that I'd certainly starve to death trying to recruit prostitutes. 
各种号码控制员，小天堂的常客，都向我提供跑腿工作。但那意味着我会赚很少的钱，直到我可以建立一个客户群。像萨米那样的皮条客是行不通的。我觉得我没有那个方向的能力，而且我肯定会饿死在试图招募妓女的路上。
Peddling reefers, Sammy and I pretty soon agreed, was the best thing. It was a relativelyuninvolved lone-wolf type of operation, and one in which I could make money immediately. Foranyone with even a little brains, no experience was needed, especially if one had any knack at allwith people. 
贩卖大麻，萨米和我很早就一致同意这是最好的事情
Both Sammy and I knew some merchant seamen and others who could supply me with loosemarijuana. And musicians, among whom I had so many good contacts, were the heaviestconsistent market for reefers. And then, musicians also used the heavier narcotics, if I laterwanted to graduate to them. That would be more risky, but also more money. Handling heroin andcocaine could earn one hundreds of dollars a day, but it required a lot of experience with thenarcotics squad for one to be able to last long enough to make anything. 
萨米和我都知道一些商人水手和其他可以为我提供大麻
  I had been around long enough either to know or to spot instinctively most regular detectives andcops, though not the narcotics people. And among the Small's veteran hustler regulars, I had avariety of potentially helpful contacts. This was important because just as Sammy could get mesupplied with marijuana, a large facet of any hustler's success was knowing where he could gethelp when he needed it. The help could involve police and detectives-as well as higher ups. But Ihadn't yet reached that stage. So Sammy staked me, about twenty dollars, I think it was. 
我已经在这个行业里待了足够长的时间，以至于我可以认识或本能地识别大多数常规侦探和警察，但不是麻醉品调查人员。在小天堂的老
Later that same night, I knocked at his door and gave him back his money and asked him if Icould lend him some. I had gone straight from Sammy's to a supplier he had mentioned. I got justa small amount of marijuana, and I got some of the paper to roll up my own sticks. As they wereonly about the size of stick matches, I was able to make enough of them so that, after sellingthem to musicians I knew at the Braddock Hotel, I could pay back Sammy and have enough profitto be in business. And those musicians when they saw their buddy, and their fan, in business: "Myman!" "Crazy, Red!" 
那天晚上晚些时候，我敲了敲他的门，把钱还给了他，并问他是否能借给我一些。
In every band, at least half of the musicians smoked reefers. I'm not going to list names; I'd haveto include some of those most prominent then in popular music, even a number of them aroundtoday. In one case, every man in one of the bands which is still famous was on marijuana. Oragain, any number of musicians could tell you who I mean when I say that one of the mostfamous singers smoked his reefers through a chicken thighbone. He had smoked so manythrough the bone that he could just light a match before the empty bone, draw the heat through,and get what he called a "contact" high. 
在每个乐队中，至少有一半的乐手吸食大麻
I kept turning over my profit, increasing my supplies, and I sold reefers like a wild man. I scarcelyslept; I was wherever musicians congregated. A roll of money was in my pocket. Every day, Icleared at least fifty or sixty dollars. In those days (or for that matter these days), this was afortune to a seventeen-year-old Negro. I felt, for the first time in my life, that great feeling of_free_! Suddenly, now, I was the peer of the other young hustlers I had admired. 
我不断地翻转我的利润，增加我的供应，像疯狂一样销售
It was at this time that I discovered the movies. Sometimes I made as many as five in one day,both downtown and in Harlem. I loved the tough guys, the action, Humphrey Bogart in"Casablanca," and I loved all of that dancing and carrying on in such films as "Stormy Weather"and "Cabin in the Sky." After leaving the movies, I'd make my connections for supplies, then rollmy sticks, and, about dark, I'd start my rounds. I'd give a couple of extra sticks when someonebought ten, which was five dollars' worth. And I didn't sell and run, because my customers weremy friends. Often I'd smoke along with them. None of them stayed any more high than I did. 
就在这个时候，我发现了电影。有时候我一天可以看五部电影，无论是在市中心还是在哈莱姆区。我喜欢那些硬汉、动作片，比如《卡萨布兰卡》中的亨弗莱·鲍嘉，还有《暴风雨》和《空中客机》中的那些跳舞和打闹的场景。看完电影后，我会去
Free now to do what I pleased, upon an impulse I went to Boston. Of course, I saw Ella. I gaveher some money: it was just a token of appreciation, I told her, for helping me when I had comefrom Lansing. She wasn't the same old Ella; she still hadn't forgiven me for Laura. She nevermentioned her, nor did I. But, even so, Ella acted better than she had when I had left for NewYork. We reviewed the family changes. Wilfred had proved so good at his trade they had askedhim to stay on at Wilberforce as an instructor. And Ella had gotten a card from Reginald who hadmanaged to get into the merchant marine. 
自由自在，我一时冲动去了波士顿。当然，我见到了埃拉。我给了她一些钱，告诉她这只是我对她帮助我在离开兰辛时的感激之情的象征。她已经不是以前那个老埃拉了；她仍然没有原谅我因为劳拉而离开她。她从未提到过她，我也没有。但是，即使如此，埃拉表现得比我离开纽约时好多了。我们回顾了家庭的变化。威尔弗雷德在自己的生意上做得很好，他们让他留在威伯福斯担任教员。而埃拉也得到了雷金纳德寄来的一张卡片，他成功地进入了商船队。
From Shorty's apartment, I called Sophia. She met me at the apartment just about as Shorty wentoff to work. I would have liked to take her out to some of the Roxbury clubs, but Shorty had toldus that, as in New York, the Boston cops used the war as an excuse to harass interracial couples,stopping them and grilling the Negro about his draft status. Of course Sophia's now being marriedmade us more cautious, too. 
从Shorty的公寓里，我给Sophia打了电话。她和Shorty在上班前就到了公寓。我本来想带她去罗克斯伯里的一些俱乐部，但是Shorty告诉我们，正如在纽约一样，波士顿的警察利用战争作为借口骚扰跨种族夫妇，停下来盘问黑人关于他的征兵状况。当然，由于Sophia现在已经结婚了，我们也变得更加谨慎了。
When Sophia caught a cab home, I went to hear Shorty's band. Yes, he had aband now. He hadsucceeded in getting a 4-F classification, and I was pleased for him and happy to go. His bandwas-well, fair. But Shorty was making out well in Boston, playing in small clubs. Back in theapartment, we talked into the next day. "Homeboy, you're something else!" Shorty kept saying. Itold him some of the wild things I'd done in Harlem, and about the friends I had. I told him thestory of Sammy the Pimp. 
当Sophia搭出租车回家时，我去听了Shorty的乐队。是的，他现在有一支乐队了。他成功地获得了4-F分类，我为他感到高兴，也很高兴去听他的乐队演奏。他的乐队还算不错，但是Shorty在波士顿过得很好，在小俱乐部里表演。回到公寓后，我们谈到了第二天的事情。“老乡，你真是个不一般的家伙！”Shorty一直这样说。我告诉他我在哈莱姆做过的一些疯狂的事情，以及我的朋友。我讲述了Sammy the Pimp的故事。
In Sammy's native Paducah, Kentucky, he had gotten a girl pregnant. Her parents made it so hotthat Sammy had come to Harlem, where he got a job as a restaurant waiter. When a womancame in to eat alone, and he found she really was alone, not married, or living with somebody, itgenerally was not hard for smooth Sammy to get invited to her apartment. He'd insist on going outto a nearby restaurant to bring back some dinner, and while he was out he would have her keyduplicated. Then, when he knew she was away, Sammy would go in and clean out all hervaluables. Sammy was then able to offer some little stake, to help her back on her feet. Thiscould be the beginning of an emotional and financial dependency, which Sammy knew how todevelop until she was his virtual slave. 
在Sammy的家乡肯塔基州的Paducah,他和一个女孩怀孕了。她的父母对她施加了很大的压力，导致Sammy来到了哈莱姆，在那里找到了一份餐厅服务员的工作。当一个女人独自来吃饭时，如果他发现她真的是一个单身的人，没有结婚或和别人住在一起，那么通常对于熟练的Sammy来说，邀请她到自己的公寓并不是一件难事。他会坚持去附近的一家餐馆带回一些晚餐，而当他外出时，他会复制她的钥匙。然后，当知道他不在的时候，Sammy会进去清理她的贵重物品。Sammy能够提供一些小额的资金帮助她重新站起来。这可能是情感和经济依赖关系的开始，Sammy知道如何发展这种关系，直到她成为他的虚拟奴隶。
Around Harlem, the narcotics squad detectives didn't take long to find out I was selling reefers,and occasionally one of them would follow me. Many a peddler was in jail because he had beencaught with the evidence on his person; I figured a way to avoid that. The law specified that if theevidence wasn't actually in your possession, you couldn't be arrested. Hollowed-out shoe heels,fake hat-linings, these things were old stuff to the detectives. 
在哈莱姆周围，麻醉品调查组的侦探们很快就发现了
I carried about fifty sticks in a small package inside my coat, under my armpit, keeping my armflat against my side. Moving about, I kept my eyes open. If anybody looked suspicious, I'd quicklycross the street, or go through a door, or turn a comer, loosening my arm enough to let thepackage drop. At night, when I usually did my selling, any suspicious person wouldn't be likely tosee thetrick. If I decided I had been mistaken, I'd go back and get my sticks. 
我将大约50根香烟放在一个小包裹里，放在我的外套里面，藏在腋下，让我的手臂平贴在身体旁边。走动时，我会保持警觉，如果有人看起来可疑，我会迅速穿过街道、通过门或转弯，松开手臂以便让包裹掉落。晚上，当我通常进行销售时，任何可疑的人都不太可能看到我的把戏。如果我意识到自己错了，我会回去拿我的香烟。
However, I lost many a stick this way. Sometimes, I knew I had frustrated a detective. And I keptout of the courts. 
然而，我这样丢了很多根香烟。有时候，我知道我已经让一个侦探沮丧了。我避免了法庭的审判。
One morning, though, I came in and found signs that my room had been entered. I knew it hadbeen detectives. I'd heard too many times how if they couldn't find any evidence, they would plantsome, where you would never find it, then they'd come back in and "find" it. I didn't even have tothink twice what to do. I packed my few belongings and never looked back. When I went to sleepagain, it was in another room. 
然而，有一天早上，我回来后发现有人进入了我的房间。我知道一定是侦探干的。我已经听过太多关于他们如果找不到任何证据，就会在某个地方埋下一些假证据，然后再“找到”它的说法了。我甚至不需要多想就知道自己该怎么做了。我收拾好自己的东西，毫不犹豫地离开了那个房间。当我再次入睡时，我已经住在另一个房间里了。
It was then that I began carrying a little .25 automatic. I got it, for some reefers, from an addictwho I knew had stolen it somewhere. I carried it pressed under my belt right down the center ofmy back. Someone had told me that the cops never hit there in any routine patting-down. Andunless I knew who I was with, I never allowed myself to get caught in any crush of people. Thenarcotics cops had been known to rush up and get their o hands on you and plant evidence while"searching." I felt that as long as I kept on the go, and in the open, I had a good chance. I don'tknow now what my real thoughts were about carrying the pistol. But I imagine I felt that I wasn'tgoing to get put away if somebody tried framing me in any situation that I could help. 
那时，我开始随身携带一把小口径的手枪。我是从一个吸毒者那里得到它的，他曾经在某个地方偷了这把枪。我将它压在腰间，正好位于背部中央。有人告诉我说，警察在例行搜身时从来不会在这个部位打你。而且除非我知道自己和谁在一起，否则我永远不会让自己陷入人群中。然后毒品调查组的人经常会冲上来夺走你的手，并在“搜查”过程中埋下证据。我觉得只要我一直保持行动，并且在公开场合，我就有很好的机会。我不知道当时我真正的想法是什么，为什么要携带手枪。但我想我觉得自己不会被关进去，如果有人想要陷害我在任何可能的情况下。
I sold less than before because having to be so careful consumed so much time. Every now andthen, on a hunch, I'd move to another room. I told nobody but Sammy where I slept. 
我卖的香烟比以前少了，因为不得不如此小心，消耗了太多的时间。时不时地，凭直觉我会搬到另一个房间去。我只告诉了Sammy我的睡觉地点，没有告诉任何人。
Finally, it was on the wire that the Harlem narcotics squad had me on its special list. 
最终，我在电话线路上被哈莱姆毒品调查组列入了特别名单。
Now, every other day or so, usually in some public place, they would flash thebadge to searchme. But I'd tell them at once, loud enough for others standing about to hear me, that I had nothingon me, and I didn't want to get anything planted on me . Then they wouldn't, because Harlemalready thought little enough of the law, and they did have to be careful that some crowd ofNegroes would not intervene roughly. Negroes were starting to get very tense in Harlem. Onecould almost smell trouble ready to break out-as it did very soon. 
现在，每隔一两天，通常是在某个公共场所，他们会出示徽章来搜查我。但我会立即告诉他们，以大声喊出来让周围的人听到，我身上什么也没有，我不想让自己身上被埋下任何东西。然后他们就不会这么做了，因为哈莱姆已经对法律不抱太多希望了，而且他们必须小心不要让一群黑人发生粗暴的干预。黑人在哈莱姆开始变得非常紧张。几乎可以闻到即将爆发的麻烦-事实证明很快就发生了。
But it was really tough on me then. I was having to hide my sticks in various places near where Iwas selling. I'd put five sticks in an empty cigarette pack, and drop the empty-looking pack by alamppost, or behind a garbage can, or a box. And I'd first tell customers to pay me, and thenwhere to pick up. 
那时候对我来说真的很难。我不得不把我的拐杖藏在我卖东西的地方附近。我会把五根拐杖放在一个空烟盒里，然后把这个看起来是空的烟盒扔到路灯杆旁、垃圾箱后或者盒子里。我会先告诉顾客付钱给我，然后再告诉他们在哪里取货。
But my regular customers didn't go for that. You couldn't expect a well-known musician to gogrubbing behind a garbage can. So I began to pick up some of the street trade, the people youcould see looked high. I collected a number of empty Red Cross bandage boxes and used themfor drops. That worked pretty good. 
但是我的常客们并不买账。你不可能指望一个著名的音乐家去垃圾箱里捡东西。于是，我开始接手一些街头小贩的生意，他们看起来都很有钱。我收集了一些空的红十字会绷带盒子，用来装药水。这样效果还不错。
But the middle-Harlem narcotics force found so many ways to harass me that I had to change myarea. I moved down to lower Harlem, around 110th Street. There were many more reefer smokersaround there, but these were a cheaper type, this was the worst of the ghetto, the poorest people,the ones who in every ghetto keep themselves narcotized to keep from having to face theirmiserable existence. I didn't last long down there, either. I lost too much of my product. After I soldto some of those reefer smokers who had the instincts of animals, they followed me and learnedmy pattern. They would dart out of a doorway, I'd drop my stuff, and they would be on it like achicken on corn. When you become an animal, a vulture, in the ghetto, as I had become, youenter a world of animals and vultures. It becomes truly the survival of only the fittest. 
但是哈莱姆中部的毒品力量找到了很多骚扰我的方法，我不得不改变我的区域。我搬到了下哈莱姆，在110街附近。
 Soon I found myself borrowing little stakes, from Sammy, from some of the musicians. Enough tobuy supplies, enough to keep high myself, enough sometimes to just eat. 
很快，我开始向山姆和其他一些音乐家借小钱。足够买必需品了，足够让我自己保持高昂的情绪了，有时也足够填饱肚子。
Then Sammy gave me an idea. 
山姆给了我一个主意。
"Red, you still got your old railroad identification?" I did have it. They hadn't taken it back. "Well,why don't you use it to make a few runs, until the heat cools?" 
“瑞德，你还有以前的铁路证件吗？” 我确实有。他们还没有把它收回去。 “好吧，你何不用它跑几趟，等到风头过了再说？”
He was right. 
他说的没错。
I found that if you walked up and showed a railroad line's employee identification card, theconductor-even a real cracker, if you approached him right, not begging-would just wave youaboard. And when he came around he would punch you one of those little coach seat slips to ridewherever die train went. 
我发现，如果你走上前出示铁路员工的证件，列车长——即使你是个真正的
The idea came tome mat, this way, I could travel all over the East Coast selling reefers among myfriends who were on tour with their bands. 
这个想法在我脑海中闪现，这样我就可以沿着东海岸旅行，在我和那些乐队的朋友巡演时
I had the New Haven identification. I worked a couple of weeks for other railroads, to get theiridentification, and men I was set. 
我有纽黑文铁路局的证件。我为其他铁路局工作了几个星期，拿到了他们的证件，这样我就准备出发了。
In New York, I rolled and packed a great quantity of sticks, and sealed them into jars. Theidentification card worked perfectly. If you persuaded the conductor you were a fellow employeewho had to go home on some family business, he just did the favor for you without a secondthought. Most whites don't give a Negro credit for having sense enough to fool them-or nerveenough. 
在纽约，我卷起并包装了大量的大麻，然后把它们密封在
I'd turn up in towns where my friends were playing. "Red!" I was an old friend from home. In thesticks, I was somebody from the Braddock Hotel. _"My man!Daddy-o!"_ And I had Big Applereefers. Nobody had ever heard of a traveling reefer peddler. 
我会在我朋友演出的城镇出现。 “瑞德！”我是家乡的一个老朋友。在这些大麻里，我是从布拉多克旅馆来的某个人。“我的伙计！
I followed no particular band. Each band's musicians knew the other bands' one-nighter touringschedules. When I ran out of supplies, I'd return to New York, and load up, then hit the roadagain. Auditoriums or gymnasiums all lighted up, the band's chartered bus outside, the dressed- up, excited, local dancers pouring in. At the door, I'd announce that I was some bandman'sbrother; in most cases they thought I was one of the musicians. Throughout the dance, I'd showthe country folks some plain and fancy lindy-hopping. Sometimes, I'd stay overnight in a town.Sometimes I'd ride the band's bus to their next stop. Sometimes, back in New York, I would stayawhile. Things had cooled down. Word was around that I had left town, and the narcotics squadwas satisfied with that. In some of the small towns, people thinking I was with the band evenmobbed me for autographs. Once, in Buffalo, my suit was nearly torn off. 
我没有跟随特定的乐队。每个乐队的音乐家都知道其他乐队的一夜巡回演出计划。当我用尽了供应品时，我会回到纽约，重新装载，然后再次上路。礼堂或体育馆都灯火通明，乐队的包车在外面，盛装打扮、兴奋不已的当地舞者蜂拥而至。在门口，我会宣称我是某位乐队成员的兄弟；在大多数情况下，他们认为我是其中一位音乐家。在整个舞蹈过程中，我向乡下人展示一些简单和华丽的跳林迪舞。有时，我会在一个城镇停留一晚。有时，我会搭上乐队的巴士前往他们的下一站。有时，回到纽约后，我会停留一段时间。事情已经冷却下来。有传言说我离开了城镇，缉毒队对此感到满意。在一些小镇上，即使人们认为我和乐队在一起，也会因为我要求签名而围殴我。有一次，在布法罗，我的西装差点被撕破。
My brother Reginald was waiting for me one day when I pulled into New York. The day before, hismerchant ship had put into port over in New Jersey. Thinking I still worked at Small's, Reginaldhad gone there, and the bartenders had directed him to Sammy, who put him up. 
有一天，当我开进纽约时，我的哥哥雷金纳德正在等我。前一天，他的商船驶入了新泽西州的港口。因为他认为我还在小斯的酒吧工作，所以雷金纳德去了那里，酒保指引他去找山姆，山姆招待了他。
It felt good to see my brother. It was hard to believe that he was once the little kid who taggedafter me. Reginald now was almost six feet tall, but still a few inches shorter than me. Hiscomplexion was darker man mine, but he had greenish eyes, and a white streak in his hair, whichwas otherwise dark reddish, something like mine. 
看到哥哥感觉很好。很难相信他曾经是那个跟在我后面的小孩子。雷金纳德现在几乎有六英尺高，但还是比我矮几英寸。他的肤色比我深，但他有一双绿色的眼睛，头发中有一缕白色，否则它是深红色的，和我的头发有点像。
I took Reginald everywhere, introducing nun. Studying my brother, I liked him. He was a lot moreself-possessed than I had been at sixteen. 
我带着雷金纳德到处走，介绍他认识纽纳。观察着我的哥哥，我喜欢上了他。他比我十六岁时更有自信。
  I didn't have a room right at the time, but I had some money, so did Reginald, and we checkedinto the St. Nicholas Hotel on Sugar Hill. It has since been torn down. 
当时我没有房间，但我有一些钱，雷金纳德也有，所以我们入住了位于苏格希尔德的圣尼古拉斯酒店。它现在已经被拆除了。
Reginald and I talked all night about the Lansing years, about our family. I told him things aboutour rather and mother that he couldn't remember. Then Reginald filled me in on our brothers andsisters. Wilfred was still a trade instructor at W ilberforce University. Hilda, still in Lansing, wastalking of getting married; so was Philbert. 
雷金纳德和我整晚谈论着在兰辛市度过的时光，我们的家人。我告诉他一些关于我们的姑姑和母亲的事情，这些事情他都已经记不得了。然后雷金纳德告诉我关于我们兄弟姐妹的事情。威尔弗雷德仍然在威伯福斯大学担任贸易讲师。希尔达仍然在兰辛市，她正在谈论结婚的事情；菲尔伯特也是如此。
Reginald and I were the next two in line. And Yvonne, Wesley, and Robert were still in Lansing, inschool. 
雷金纳德和我是接下来两个在世的人。伊芳妮、卫斯理和罗伯特仍然在兰辛市上学。
Reginald and I laughed about Philbert, who, the last time I had seen him, had gotten deeplyreligious; he wore one of those round straw hats. 
雷金纳德和我嘲笑着菲伯，上次我见到他时，他已经变得非常虔诚了；他戴着一顶圆边的草帽。
Reginald's ship was in for about a week getting some kind of repairs on its engines. I was pleasedto see that Reginald, though he said little about it, admired my living by my wits. Reginalddressed a little too loudly, I thought. I got a reefer customer of mine to get him a moreconservative overcoat and suit. I told 
雷金纳德的船停泊在港口大约一周，进行引擎维修。我很高兴看到雷金纳德虽然很少谈论此事，却对我凭借聪明才智谋生的方式表示赞赏。我认为雷金纳德穿得有点太过张扬了。
Reginald what I had learned: that in order to get something you had to look as though you alreadyhad something. 
雷金纳德学到了一些东西：要想得到某些东西，就必须表现得像是已经拥有了这些东西一样。
Before Reginald left, I urged him to leave the merchant marine and I would help him get started inHarlem. I must have felt that having my kid brother around me would be a good thing. Then therewould be two people I could trust-Sammy was the other. 
在雷金纳德离开之前，我劝他离开商船，我会帮助他在哈莱姆开始新的生活。我一定觉得有我的兄弟在身边是一件好事。这样就会有两个人我可以信任了——山姆是另一个人。
Reginald was cool. At his age, I would have been willing to run behind thetrain, to get to New Yorkand to Harlem. But Reginald, when he left, said, "I'll think about it." 
雷金纳德很冷静。以他的年龄，我愿意追着火车跑到纽约和新哈莱姆。但是当雷金纳德离开时，他说：“我会考虑一下。”
Not long after Reginald left, I dragged out the wildest zoot suit in New York. This was 1943. TheBoston draft board had written me at Ella's, and when they had no results there, had notified theNew York draft board, and, in care of Sammy, I received Uncle Sam's Greetings. 
在雷金纳德离开后不久，我穿上了纽约最时髦的奇装异服。那是1943年。波士顿征兵委员会曾经去过艾拉家找我，但没有结果，于是通知了纽约征兵委员会，并通过山姆转交给我“老大哥”的问候。
In those days only three things in the world scared me: jail, a job, and the Army. I had about tendays before I was to show up at the induction center. I went right to work. The Army Intelligencesoldiers, those black spies in civilian clothes, hung around in Harlem with their ears open for thewhite man downtown. I knew exactly where to start dropping the word. I started noising aroundthat I was frantic to join. . . the Japanese Army. 
在那些日子里，世界上只有三件事情让我害怕：坐牢、找工作和加入军队。我还有大约十天就要去入伍中心报道了。我开始行动起来。军队情报局的士兵，那些穿着便装的黑人间谍，他们潜伏在哈莱姆，耳朵里听着市区里的白人的动向。我知道从哪里开始散布消息。我开始四处打听，说我非常渴望加入日本军队。
When I sensed that I had the ears of the spies, I would talk and act high and crazy. A lot ofHarlem hustlers actually had reached that state-as I would later. It was inevitable when one hadgone long enough on heavier and heavier narcotics, and under the steadily tightening vise of thehustling life. I'd snatch out and read my Greetings aloud, to make certain they heard who I was,and when I'd report downtown. (This was probably the only time my real name was ever heard inHarlem in those days.) 
当我感觉到有间谍在听我说话时，我会表现得很高傲和疯狂。许多哈莱姆的骗子实际上已经达到了这种状态——就像我后来一样。当一个人长期吸食越来越重的毒品，同时在赌博的生活中不断受到挤压时，这是不可避免的。我会突然拿出并大声朗读我的问候语，以确保他们知道我是谁，并在我报告市中心时。（这可能是那些日子里哈莱姆唯一一次听到我的真实姓名的时候。）
The day I went down there, I costumed like an actor. With my wild zoot suit I wore the yellowknob-toe shoes, and I frizzled my hair up into a reddish bush of conk. 
当我去那里的时候，我打扮成演员的样子。穿着我那时髦的奇装异服，我穿着黄色脚趾鞋，我把头发弄成了一丛红色的栗子般的卷发。
I went in, skipping and tipping, and I thrust my tattered Greetings at that reception desk's whitesoldier-"Crazy-o, daddy-o, get me moving. I can't wait to get in that brown"-very likely that soldierhasn't recovered from me yet. 
我进去时跳跃着，摇晃着，然后把我破烂不堪的问候语猛地扔在接待台的白人士兵面前——“Crazy-o，daddy-o，让我动起来。我迫不及待地想加入那支部队”——很有可能那个士兵还没有从我的表演中恢复过来。
 They had their wire on me from uptown, all right. But they still put me through the line. In that bigstarting room were forty or fifty other prospective inductees. The room had fallen vacuum-quiet,with me running my mouth a mile a minute, talking nothing but slang. I was going to fight on allfronts; I was going to be a general, man, before I got done-such talk as that. 
他们在上游有线人监视我，但是他们还是让我通过了。在那个大起居室里有四十或五十个其他未来的入伍者。房间变得真空般寂静，我不停地说话，只讲黑话。我要在所有战线上战斗；我要成为一名将军，伙计，在我完成之前——像这样的言论。
Most of them were white, of course. The tender-looking ones appeared ready to run from me.Some others had that vinegary "worst kind of nigger" look. And a few were amused, seeing me asthe "Harlem jigaboo" archetype. 
他们大多数是白人，当然。那些看起来柔弱的人似乎准备从我身边逃跑。其他人则带着酸味的“最糟糕的黑人”的表情。还有一些人觉得很有趣，把我当成了哈莱姆街头混混的典型代表。
Also amused were some of the room's ten or twelve Negroes. But the stony-faced rest of themlooked as if they were ready to sign up to go off killing somebody-they would have liked to startwith me. 
房间里的十到十二个黑人中也有一些觉得很有趣。但是其他人面无表情，看起来好像他们已经准备好去杀人了——他们可能会从我开始。
The line moved along. Pretty soon, stripped to my shorts, I was making my eager-to-joincomments in the medical examination rooms-and everybody in the white coats that I saw had 4-Fin his eyes. 
队伍缓慢地向前移动。很快，我脱下了裤子，穿着短裤在体检室里发表着渴望入伍的言论——我看到的每一个穿白大褂的人都瞪大了眼睛。
I stayed in the line longer than I expected, before they siphoned me off. One of the white coatsaccompanied me around a turning hallway: I knew we were on the way to a head-shrinker-theArmy psychiatrist. 
我在队伍里待的时间比我预期的要长，直到他们把我抽出来。一个白大褂陪着我在一条拐弯的走廊上走：我知道我们正在去一个脑科医生那里——军队的精神病医生。
The receptionist there was a Negro nurse. I remember she was in her early twenties, and not badto look at. She was one of those Negro "firsts." 
那里的接待员是一个黑人护士。我记得她二十多岁，看起来不错。她是那些黑人“第一夫人”之一。
Negroes know what I'm talking about. Back then, the white man during the war was so pressedfor personnel that he began letting some Negroes put down their buckets and mops and dustrags and use a pencil, or sit at some desk, or hold some twenty-five-cent tide. You couldn't readthe Negro press for the big pictures of smug black "firsts." 
黑人知道我说的是什么。那时候，战争期间的白人因为人手不足而开始让一些黑人放下水桶、拖把和抹布，用铅笔做事，或者坐在桌子旁，或者拿着25美分的零钱。你无法在黑人报纸上看到那些自鸣得意的黑人“第一夫人”的大照片。
 Somebody was inside with the psychiatrist. I didn't even have to put on any act for this black girl;she was already sick of me. 
有人和精神病医生在里面。我甚至不需要对这个黑人女孩装假，她已经厌倦了我。
When, finally, a buzz came at her desk, she didn't send me, _she_ went in. I knew what she wasdoing, she was going to make clear, in advance, what she thought of me . This is still one of theblack man's big troubles today. So many of those so-called "upper-class" Negroes are so busytrying to impress on the white man that they are "different from those others" that they can't seethey are only helping the white man to keep his low opinion of _all_ Negroes. 
最终，当有人敲响她的桌子时，她没有让我进去，而是自己进去了。我知道她在做什么，她想提前表明她对我的看法。这仍然是今天黑人面临的一个大问题。如此多那些所谓的“上层”黑人如此忙于试图给白人留下深刻印象，以至于他们无法看到他们只是在帮助白人保持对所有黑人的低评价。
And then, with her prestige in the clear, she came out and nodded to me to go in. 
然后，她利用自己的声望，走出来向我点点头示意我进去。
I must say this for that psychiatrist. He tried to be objective and professional in his manner. He satthere and doodled with his blue pencil on a tablet, listening to me spiel to him for three or fourminutes before he got a word in. 
我必须为那位精神病医生说句公道话。他试图以客观和专业的方式对待我。他坐在那里，用蓝色的铅笔在一张纸上乱涂乱画，听了我三四分钟的胡扯之后才开口说话。
His tack was quiet questions, to get at why I was so anxious. I didn't rush him; I circled andhedged, watching him closely, to let him think he was pulling what he wanted out of me . I keptjerking around, backward, as though somebody might be listening. I knew I was going to sendhim back to the books to figure what kind of a case I was. 
他的策略是问一些沉默的问题，以了解我为什么这么焦虑。我没有催促他，而是绕着圈子回答，密切观察他，让他认为他能够从我这里得到他想要的答案。我一直在向后摇晃，好像有人在监听一样。我知道我要送他去查阅资料来分析我的情况。
Suddenly, I sprang up and peeped under both doors, the one I'd entered and another thatprobably was a closet. And then I bent and whispered fast in his ear. "Daddy-o, now you and me,we're from up North here, so don't you tell nobody. . . . I want to get sent down South. Organizethem nigger soldiers, you dig? Steal us some guns, and kill us crackers!" 
突然间，我跳了起来，向两个门底下偷看了一眼，一个是我进来的门，另一个可能是一个壁橱。然后我弯下腰，在他耳边快速低语。“Daddy-o，现在我们来自北方，所以不要告诉任何人……我想被派往南方。
That psychiatrist's blue pencil dropped, and his professional manner fell off in all directions. Hestared at me as if I were a snake's egg hatching, fumbling forhis red pencil. I knew I had him. Iwas going back out past Miss First when he said, "That will be all." 
那位精神病医生的蓝色铅笔掉了下来，他的专业态度也四分五裂。他盯着我，好像我是一只蛇蛋孵化一样，摸索着他的红色铅笔。我知道我已经掌握了他。当他说“好了”时，我要回到第一个小姐那里。
A 4-F card came to me in the mail, and I never heard from the Army anymore, and neverbothered to ask why I was rejected. 
一张4-F卡片邮寄到我手中，之后我就再也没有收到过军队的通知，也从来没有去问为什么被拒绝了。
CHAPTER SEVEN 
第七章
HUSTLER 
街头摊贩。
I can't remember all the hustles I had during the next two years in Harlem, after the abrupt end ofmy riding the trains and peddling reefers to the touring bands. 
我记不清我在哈莱姆的两年里经历了多少艰辛，自从我突然结束了在火车上卖烟给巡回乐队的工作之后。
Negro railroad men waited for their trains in their big locker room on the lower level of GrandCentral Station. Big blackjack and poker games went on in there around the clock. Sometimesfive hundred dollars would be on the table. One day, in a blackjack game, an old cook who wasdealing the cards tried to be slick, and I had to drop my pistol in his face. 
黑人铁路工人在中央车站下层的大型储物室等待他们的火车。那里有全天候进行的大二十一点和扑克游戏。有时候桌子上会摆五千美元。有一天，在一场二十一点游戏中，一个正在发牌的老厨师试图耍滑头，我不得不把手枪对准他的脸。
The next time I went into one of those games, intuition told me to stick my gun under my belt rightdown the middle of my back. Sure enough, someone had squealed. Two big, beefy-faced Irishcops came in. They frisked me-and they missed my gun where they hadn't expected one. 
下一次我参加了其中一场游戏，直觉告诉我将手枪放在我的腰带正中间。果然，有人尖叫了。两个高大威猛的爱尔兰警察走了进来。他们搜查了我-他们没有在预期的地方找到我的枪。
The cops told me never again to be caught in Grand Central Station unless I had a ticket to ridesomewhere. And I knew that by the next day, every railroad's personnel office would have ablackball on me, so I never tried to get another railroad job. 
警察告诉我，不要再在中央车站被捕，除非我有一张乘车的车票。我知道到了第二天，每个铁路人员办公室都会有一张黑名单，所以我再也没试着找一份铁路工作。
 There I was back in Harlem's streets among all the rest of the hustlers. I couldn't sell reefers; thedope squad detectives were too familiar with me. I was a true hustler-uneducated, unskilled atanything honorable, and I considered myself nervy and cunning enough to live by my wits,exploiting any prey that presented itself.  I would risk just about anything. 
我回到了哈莱姆的街道上，和其他所有的小贩在一起。我不能再卖烟了；缉毒组的探员们太熟悉我了。我是一个真正的小贩——没有受过教育，没有任何值得尊敬的技能，我认为自己足够紧张和狡猾，可以靠智慧生活，利用任何出现在面前的猎物。我会不惜一切风险。
Right now, in every big city ghetto, tens of thousands of yesterday's and today's school dropoutsare keeping body and soul together by some form of hustling in the same way I did. 
现在，在每个大城市的贫民区，成千上万昨天和今天的辍学者以我所做的同样方式通过某种形式的小贩活动维持着身体和灵魂的联系。
And they inevitably move into more and more, worse and worse, illegality and immorality. Full- time hustlers never can relax to appraise what they are doing and where they are bound. As isthe case in any jungle, t he hustler's every waking hour is lived with both the practical and thesubconscious knowledge that if he ever relaxes, if he ever slows down, the other hungry, restlessfoxes, ferrets, wolves, and vultures out there with him won't hesitate to make him their prey. 
他们不可避免地会涉足越来越多、越来越糟糕的非法和不道德行为。全职小贩永远无法放松地评估他们的所作所为以及他们所处的环境。就像在丛林中一样，小贩的每一个清醒时刻都伴随着实际和潜意识的知识：如果他放松警惕，如果他放慢脚步，那些饥饿、不安的其他狐狸、野兔、狼和秃鹫就会毫不犹豫地将他作为猎物。
During the next six to eight months, I pulled my first robberies and stick-ups. Only small ones.Always in other, nearby cities. And I got away. As the pros did, I too would key myself to pull thesejobs  by my first use of hard dope. I began with Sammy's recommendation-sniffing cocaine. 
在接下来的六到八个月里，我进行了第一次抢劫和持枪抢劫。只是小打小闹。总是在附近的其他城市。而且我逃之夭夭了。就像专业人士一样，我也用我第一次使用的硬毒品来使自己适应这些工作。我开始使用萨米推荐的方法——吸食可卡因。
Normally now, for street wear, I might call it, I carried a hardly noticeable little flat, blue-steel .25automatic. But for working, I carried a .32, a .38 or a .45. I saw how when the eyes stared at thebig black hole, the faces fell slack and the mouths sagged open. And when I spoke, the peopleseemed to hear as though they were far away, and they would do whatever I asked. 
通常来说，我现在穿的是街头服装，我可能称之为，我携带着一台几乎不显眼的小型、蓝色钢制的。25自动手枪。但是为了工作，我携带的是。32口径、.38口径或。45口径的手枪。我看到当眼睛凝视着大黑洞时，人们的脸变得松弛，嘴巴也松弛地张开。当我说话时，人们似乎听不见，好像他们离得很远，他们会做任何我要求的事情。
Between jobs, staying high on narcotics kept me from getting nervous. Still, upon suddenimpulses, just to play safe, I would abruptly move from one toanother fifteen-to twenty-dollar-a- week room, always in my favorite 147th-150th Street area, just f lanking Sugar Hill. 
在两次工作之间，保持对麻醉剂的高度依赖使我不会感到紧张。尽管如此，为了保险起见，当有突然的冲动时，我会突然从一个房间搬到另一个每周十五到二十美元的房间，总是在我最喜欢的第147到150街区域，就在Sugar Hill附近。
Once on a job with Sammy, we had a pretty close call. Someone must have seen us. We weremaking our getaway, running, when we heard the sirens. Instantly, we slowed to walking. As apolice car screeched to a stop, we stepped out into the street, meeting it, hailing it to ask fordirections. They must have thought we were about to give them some information. They justcursed us and raced on. Again, it didn't cross the white men's minds that a trick like that might bepulled on them by Negroes. 
有一次我和萨米一起工作，我们遇到了一次很危险的遭遇。有人肯定看到了我们。当我们正在逃跑时，听到警笛声。立即，我们放慢了脚步，开始步行。当一辆警车急刹车停下来时，我们走上街头，迎接它，请求指引方向。他们可能认为我们要向他们提供一些信息。他们只是诅咒着我们，继续前行。同样，白人不会想到这种小把戏可能会被黑人用来对付他们。
The suits that I wore, the finest, I bought hot for about thirty-five to fifty dollars. I made it my rulenever to go after more than I needed to live on. Any experienced hustler will tell you that gettinggreedy is the quickest road to prison. I kept "cased" in my head vulnerable places and situationsand I would perform the next job only when my bankroll in my pocket began to get too low. 
我穿的套装，最好的，我以大约三十五到五十美元的价格买来的。我的原则是永远不追求超过我生活所需的钱。任何有经验的小贩都会告诉你，贪婪是通向监狱的最快之路。我一直在脑海中考虑容易受到攻击的地方和情况，只有当我口袋里的银行资金开始变得太低时，我才会执行下一个任务。
Some weeks, I bet large amounts on the numbers. I still played with the same runner with whomI'd started in Small's Paradise. Playing my hunches, many a day I'd have up to forty dollars ontwo numbers, hoping for that fabulous six hundred-to-one payoff. But I never did hit a big numberfull force. There's no telling what I would have done if ever I'd landed $10,000 or $12,000 at onetime. Of course, once in a while I'd hit a small combination figure. Sometimes, flush like that, I'dtelephone Sophia to come over from Boston for a couple of days. 
有些星期，我会在数字上下大赌注。我还是和我在Small's Paradise开始时玩的同一批跑得快的人一起玩。根据我的直觉，许多天我会有多达四十美元的赌注在两个数字上，希望获得惊人的六百比一的回报。但我从来没有全力击中一个大数字。如果我一次拿到了一万或一万两千美元，我也不知道我会做什么。当然，偶尔我会击中一个小的组合数字。有时候，像这样走运，我会打电话给索菲亚从波士顿来度几天假。
I went to the movies a lot again. And I never missed my musician friends wherever they wereplaying, either in Harlem, downtown at the big theaters, or on 52nd Street. 
我再次经常去看电影。无论我的音乐朋友们在哪里演奏，无论是在哈莱姆、市中心的大剧院还是在52街，我从未错过过他们。
 Reginald and I got very close the next time his ship came back into New York. We discussed ourfamily, and what a-shame it was that our book-loving oldest brother Wilfred had never had thechance to go to some of those big universities where he would have gone far. And we exchangedthoughts we had never shared with anyone. 
当雷金纳德的船再次回到纽约时，我们变得非常亲密。我们讨论了我们的家庭，以及我们的书呆子哥哥威尔弗雷德从未有机会去那些他本可以走得更远的大型大学是多么可耻。我们还交换了我们从未与任何人分享过的想法。
Reginald, in his quiet way, was a mad fan of musicians and music. When his ship sailed onemorning without him, a principal reason was that I had thoroughly exposed him to the excitingmusical world. We had wild times backstage with the musicians when they were playing the Roxy,or the Paramount. After selling reefers with the bands as they traveled, I was known to almostevery popular Negro musician around New York in 1944- 1945. 
雷金纳德以他平静的方式成为了一个疯狂的音乐家和音乐迷。有一天早上他的船没有带他去航行，主要原因是我已经让他充分接触到了令人兴奋的音乐世界。当我们的乐队在罗克西或帕拉蒙剧院演出时，我们在后台与音乐家们狂欢。在1944-1945年期间，我在他们旅行时与乐队一起卖香烟，以至于几乎每个著名的纽约黑人音乐家都知道我。
Reginald and I went to the Savoy Ballroom, the Apollo Theater, the Braddock Hotel bar, thenightclubs and speakeasies, wherever Negroes played music. The great Lady Day, Billie Holiday,hugged him and called him "baby brother." Reginald shared tens of thousands of Negroes'feelings that the living end of the big bands was Lionel Hampton's. I was very close to many ofthe men in Hamp's band; I introduced Reginald to them, and also to Hamp himself, and Hamp'swife and business manager, Gladys Hampton. One of this world's sweetest people is Hamp.Anyone who knows him will tell you that he'd often do the most generous things for people hebarely knew. As much money as Hamp has made, and still makes, he would be broke today if hismoney and his business weren't handled by Gladys, who is one of the brainiest women I evermet. The Apollo Theater's owner, Frank Schifrman, could tell you. He generally signed bands toplay for a set weekly amount, but I know that once during those days Gladys Hampton insteadarranged a deal for Hamp's band to play for a cut of the gate. Then the usual number of showswas doubled up-if I'm not mistaken, eight shows a day, instead of the usual four-and Hamp'spulling power cleaned up. Gladys Hampton used to talk to me a lot, and she tried togive me goodadvice: "Calm down, Red." Gladys saw how wild I was. She saw me headed toward a bad end. 
雷金纳德和我去了萨沃剧院、阿波罗剧院、布拉多克酒店的酒吧、夜总会和地下酒吧，无论黑人音乐家们在哪里演奏音乐。伟大的女神戴安娜·劳伊德（Lady Day）和比莉·霍利迪（Billie Holiday）拥抱他，称他为“宝贝弟弟”。雷金纳德分享了成千上万黑人的感受，认为大乐队的生活尽头是莱昂内尔·汉普顿（Lionel Hampton）。我与汉普顿乐队的许多人关系非常亲密；我向他们介绍了雷金纳德，还有汉普顿本人、他的妻子兼业务经理格拉迪斯·汉普顿（Gladys Hampton）。世界上最伟大的人之一就是汉普顿。任何认识他的人都会告诉你，他会经常为那些几乎不认识他的人做最慷慨的事情。即使汉普顿赚了这么多钱，而且仍在赚钱，如果他的钱和他的生意不是由格拉迪斯处理的，他今天就破产了。格拉迪斯是我见过的最聪明的女人之一。阿波罗剧院的老板弗兰克·希弗曼（Frank Schifrman）可以告诉您。他通常签署乐队按照每周固定的金额表演，但我知道有一次，在那些日子里，格拉迪斯·汉普顿安排了一份合同，让汉普顿的乐队从门票收入中分一杯羹。然后通常的演出次数翻了一番——如果我没有记错的话，每天八场演出，而不是通常的四场——汉普顿的吸引力也得到了清理。格拉迪斯·汉普顿曾经经常和我谈论，她试图给我好建议：“冷静下来，红。”格拉迪斯看到我是多么疯狂。她看到我要走向一个坏结局。
One of the things I liked about Reginald was that when I left him to go away "working," Reginaldasked me no questions. After he came to Harlem, I went on more jobs than usual. I guess thatwhat influenced me to get my first actual apartment was my not wanting Reginald to be knockingaround Harlem without anywhere to call "home." That first apartment was three rooms, for ahundred dollars a month, I think, in the front basement of a house on 147th Street betweenConvent and St. Nicholas Avenues. Living in the rear basement apartment, right behind Reginaldand me, was one of Harlem's most successful narcotics dealers. 
我喜欢雷金纳德的一件事是，当我离开他去“工作”时，雷金纳德从不问我问题。在他来到哈莱姆之后，我比平时更多地去了一些地方。我认为，影响我获得第一个真正公寓的原因是，我不想让雷金纳德在哈莱姆没有地方可称之为“家”地四处走动。那个公寓有三个房间，我认为这是每月一百美元，位于147街康普顿和圣尼古拉斯大道之间的一所房子的前地下室里。住在我们后面的地下室公寓里的是哈莱姆最成功的毒品贩子之一。
With the apartment as our headquarters, I gradually got Reginald introduced around to CreoleBill's, and other Harlem after-hours spots. About two o'clock every morning, as the downtownwhite nightclubs closed, Reginald and I would stand around in front of this or that Harlem after- hours place, and I'd school him to what was happening. 
随着公寓成为我们的总部，我逐渐让雷金纳德熟悉了克里奥尔比尔（Creole Bill）和其他哈莱姆的夜生活场所。每天凌晨两点左右，随着市中心的白人夜总会关闭，雷金纳德和我会在哈莱姆的某个夜生活场所前站岗，我会向他介绍发生了什么事情。
Especially after the nightclubs downtown closed, the taxis and black limousines would be drivinguptown, bringing those white people who never could get enough of Negro _soul_. The placespopular with these whites ranged all the way from the big locally famous ones such as Jimmy'sChicken Shack, and Dickie Wells', to the little here-tonight-gone-tomorrow-night private clubs, so- called, where a dollar was collected at the door for "membership." 
尤其是在市中心的夜总会关闭后，出租车和黑色豪华轿车会驶向市中心，带来那些永远无法满足于黑人灵魂的白人。这些白人喜欢的地方从当地著名的大型地方，例如Jimmy's Chicken Shack和Dickie Wells，到所谓的今晚来明晚走的私人俱乐部不等。在这里，门口收取一美元作为“会员费”。
Inside every after-hours spot, the smoke would hurt your eyes. Four white people to every Negrowould be in there drinking whisky from coffee cups and eating fried chicken. The generally flush- faced white men and their makeup-masked, glittery-eyed women would be pounding each other'sbacks and uproariously laughing and applauding the music. A lot of the whites, drunk,would gostaggering up to Negroes, the waiters, the owners, or Negroes at tables, wringing their hands,even trying to hug them, 
每个夜生活场所内部都烟雾缭绕，会刺激你的眼睛。每四个白人就会在场所里喝着咖啡杯中的威士忌，吃着炸鸡。通常红润的脸庞的白人男子和涂着化妆品、闪亮眼睛的女子会互相拍背，大声笑着，欢呼着音乐。许多喝醉的白人会摇摇晃晃地走向黑人服务员、业主或餐桌上的黑人，紧握他们的手，甚至试图拥抱他们。
"You're just as good as I am-I want you to know that!" The most famous places drew both Negroand white celebrities who enjoyed each other. A jam-packed four-thirty A.M. crowd at Jimmy'sChicken Shack or Dickie Wells' might have such jam-session entertainment as Hazel Scottplaying the piano for Billie Holiday singing the blues. Jimmy's Chicken Shack, incidentally, waswhere once, later on, I worked briefly as a waiter. That's where Redd Foxx was the dishwasherwho kept the kitchen crew in stitches. 
“你和我一样好，我想让你知道！”最著名的地方吸引了黑人和白人名人，他们彼此欣赏。在Jimmy's Chicken Shack或Dickie Wells的四点半晚高峰人群可能会得到这样的即兴表演娱乐，比如黑泽尔·斯科特（Hazel Scott）为Billie Holiday弹钢琴，唱蓝调。顺便说一下，Jimmy's Chicken Shack是我后来曾经短暂地做过服务员的地方。那就是Redd Foxx在那里做洗碗工的地方，他总是让厨房工作人员开怀大笑。
After a while, my brother Reginald had to have a hustle, and I gave much thought to what wouldbe, for him, a good, safe hustle. After he'd learned his own way around, it would be up to him totake risks for himself-if he wanted to make more and quicker money. 
过了一会儿，我哥哥雷金纳德不得不去忙碌，我深思熟虑地考虑了对他来说一个安全而好的工作。在他学会自己做事之后，他可以为自己冒险——如果他想要赚更多的钱和更快的钱。
The hustle I got Reginald into really was very simple. It utilized the psychology of the ghettojungle. Downtown, he paid the two dollars, or whatever it was, for a regular city peddler's license.Then I took him to a manufacturers' outlet where we bought a supply of cheap imperfect"seconds"-shirts, underwear, cheap rings, watches, all kinds of quick-sale items. 
我为雷金纳德找到的工作其实非常简单。它利用了贫民窟的心理。在市中心，他支付两美元或任何金额，以获得常规的城市小贩许可证。然后我带他去一个制造商直销店，我们买了一批廉价的不完美“次品” - 衬衫、内衣、便宜的戒指、手表，各种快速销售的物品。
Watching me work this hustle back in Harlem, Reginald quickly caught on to how to go intobarbershops, beauty parlors, and bars acting very nervous as he let the customers peep into hissmall valise of "loot." With so many thieves around anxious to get rid of stolen good-qualitymerchandise cheaply, many Haderoites, purely because of this conditioning, jumped to pay hotprices for inferior goods whose sale was perfectly legitimate. It never took long to get rid of avaliseful for at least twice what it had cost. And if any cop stopped Reginald, he had in his pocketboth the peddler's license and the manufacturers' outlet bills of sale. Reginald only had to becertain that none of the customersto whom he sold ever saw that he was legitimate. 
在哈莱姆，看着我做这个小买卖，雷金纳德很快就学会了如何在理发店、美容院和酒吧工作，表现得非常紧张，让客户看到他的小提包里的“战利品”。由于许多小偷急于以低廉的价格处理偷来的优质商品，许多哈德罗主义者纯粹因为这一套训练而愿意为劣质商品支付高价，而这些商品的销售是完全合法的。很快，他的手提包里就会装满至少价值两倍于成本的战利品。如果有任何警察拦住雷金纳德，他就可以在口袋里找到小贩许可证和制造商直销店的售货单。雷金纳德只需要确保他卖给的每个客户都不知道他是合法的。
I assumed that Reginald, like most of the Negroes I knew, would go for a white woman. I'd pointout Negro-happy white women to him, and explain that a Negro with any brains could wrap thesewomen around his ringers. But I have to say this for Reginald: he never liked white women. Iremember the one time he met Sophia; he was so cool it upset Sophia, and it tickled me. 
我猜想雷金纳德会像我所认识的大多数黑人一样，去找一位白人女性。我会向他指出那些喜欢黑人的白人女性，并解释一个有头脑的黑人可以围绕这些女性来编织他的花言巧语。但是我必须说雷金纳德：他从来不喜欢白人女性。我记得有一次他遇见索菲亚；他太酷了，这让索菲亚感到不安，这让我感到有趣。
Reginald got himself a black woman. I'd guess she was pushing thirty; an "old settler," as wecalled them back in those days. She was a waitress in an exclusive restaurant downtown. Shelavished on Reginald everything she had, she was so happy to get a young man. I mean shebought him clothes, cooked and washed for him, and everything, as though he were a baby. 
雷金纳德找了一位黑人女性。我猜她快三十岁了，我们那时候称之为“老定居者”。她是市中心一家高档餐厅的女服务员。她把所有的一切都奉献给了雷金纳德，她很高兴能找到一个年轻男子。我的意思是，她为他买衣服，为他做饭、洗衣服，以及所有的事情，就像他是个婴儿一样。
That was just a nother example of why my respect for my younger brother kept increasing.Reginald showed, in often surprising ways, more sense than a lot of working hustlers twice hisage. Reginald then was only sixteen, but, a six-footer, he looked and acted much older than hisyears. 
这再次证明了我对我的小弟弟越来越尊重的原因
*     *     * 
All through the war, the Harlem racial picture never was too bright. Tension built to a pretty highpitch. Old-timers told me that Harlem had never been the same since the 1935 riot, when millionsof dollars worth of damage was done by thousands of Negroes, infuriated chiefly by the whitemerchants in Harlem refusing to hire a Negro even as their stores raked in Harlem's money. 
在整个战争期间，哈莱姆的种族情况从未太好过。紧张局势达到了相当高的程度。老人们告诉我，自1935年骚乱以来，哈莱姆从未变过，当时数以千计的黑人因哈莱姆的白人商人拒绝雇用黑人而感到愤怒，尽管他们的商店一直在赚取哈莱姆的钱。成千上万的商品被损坏了价值数百万美元。
During World War II, Mayor LaGuardia officially closed the Savoy Ballroom. Harlem said the realreason was to stop Negroes from dancing with white women. Harlem said that no one draggedthe white women in there. Adam Clayton Powell made it a big fight. He had successfully foughtConsolidatedEdison and the New York Telephone Company until they had hired Negroes. Thenhe had helped to battle the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army about their segregating of uniformedNegroes. But Powell couldn't win this battle. City Hall kept the Savoy closed for a long time. It wasjust a nother one of the "liberal North" actions that didn't help Harlem to love the white man any. 
第二次世界大战期间，拉瓜迪亚市长正式关闭了萨沃伊舞厅。哈莱姆说，真正的原因是为了阻止黑人和白人女性跳舞。哈莱姆表示没有人在那里拖拽白人女性。亚当·克莱顿·鲍威尔（Adam Clayton Powell）将此事变成了一场大斗争。他成功地与Consolidated Edison和纽约电话公司斗争，直到他们雇用了黑人员工。然后，他又帮助打击美国海军和美国陆军对穿制服的黑人的种族隔离政策。但是鲍威尔无法赢得这场战斗。市政府长期以来一直关闭着萨沃伊舞厅。这只是“自由北方”采取的另一个行动之一，没有帮助哈莱姆喜欢白人男性。
Finally, rumor flashed that in the Braddock Hotel, white cops had shot a Negro soldier. I waswalking down St. Nicholas Avenue; I saw all of these Negroes hollering and running north from125th Street. Some of them were loaded down with armfuls of stuff. I remember it was thebandleader Fletcher Henderson's nephew "Shorty" Henderson who told me what had happened.Negroes were smashing store windows, and taking everything they could grab and carry- furniture, food, jewelry, clothes, whisky. Within an hour, every New York City cop seemed to be inHarlem. Mayor LaGuardia and the NAACP's then Secretary, the famed late Walter White, were ina red firecar, riding around pleading over a loudspeaker to all of those shouting, muling, angryNegroes to please go home and stay inside. 
最后，传言四起，说在布拉多克酒店（Braddock Hotel）里，白人警察开枪打死了一名黑人士兵。当时我正沿着圣尼古拉斯大道走，看到一群黑人从125街向北奔跑并大声喊叫。他们中有些人背着沉重的行囊。我记得乐队领队弗莱彻·亨德森（Fletcher Henderson）的侄子“矮子”亨德森告诉了我发生了什么事情。黑人砸碎了商店的窗户，抢走了他们能够拿到的一切——家具、食品、珠宝、衣服、威士忌酒。在一个小时内，每个纽约市的警察似乎都来到了哈莱姆。拉瓜迪亚市长和当时的全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）秘书、著名的已故的沃尔特·怀特（Walter White）乘坐一辆红色消防车，通过扩音器向所有叫喊、咆哮、愤怒的黑人恳求回家并呆在室内。
Just recently I ran into Shorty Henderson on Seventh Avenue. We were laughing about a fellowwhom the riot had left with the nickname of "Left Feet." In a scramble in a women's shoe store,somehow he'd grabbed five shoes, all of them for left feet! And we laughed about the scared littleChinese whose restaurant didn't have a hand laid on it, because the rioters just a bout convulsedlaughing when they saw the sign the Chinese had hastily stuck on his front door: "Me ColoredToo." 
就在最近，我在第七大道上遇到了矮子亨德森。我们都在笑一个家伙，他在暴乱中留下了“左脚”的绰号。在一家女鞋店的一次争夺中，不知怎么的，他抢了五只鞋，都是左脚的！我们嘲笑那些受惊的小中国人，他们的餐馆没有一只手放在上面，因为当暴徒们看到中国人匆忙贴在他的前门上的牌子“我也是有色人种”时，他们笑得前仰后合。
After the riot, things got very tight in Harlem. It was terrible for the night-life people, and for thosehustlers whose main income had been the white man's money. The 1935 riot had left only arelative trickle of the money which had poured into Harlem during the 1920's. And now this newriot ended even that trickle.Today the white people who visit Harlem, and this mostly on weekend nights, are hardly morethan a few dozen who do the twist, the frug, the Watusi, and all the rest of the current dancecrazes in Small's Paradise, owned now by the great basketball champion "Wilt the Stilt"Chamberlain, who draws crowds with his big, clean, All-American-athlete image. Most whitepeople today are physically afraid to come to Harlem-and it's for good reasons, too. Even forNegroes, Harlem night life is about finished. Most of the Negroes who have money to spend arespending it downtown somewhere in this hypocritical "integration," in places where previously thepolice would have been called to haul off any Negro insane enough to try and get in. The alreadyCroesus-rich white man can't get another skyscraper hotel finished and opened before all theseintegration-mad Negroes, who themselves don't own a tool shed, are booking the swanky newhotel for "cotillions" and "conventions." Those rich whites could afford it when they used to throwaway their money in Harlem. But Negroes can't afford to be taking their money downtown to thewhite man. 
骚乱之后，哈莱姆的生活变得非常拮据。对于夜生活的人来说，这是一场噩梦，对于那些主要依靠白人的钱来维持生计的街头小贩来说也是如此。1935年的骚乱只留下了一小部分涌入哈莱姆的金钱，这些钱在20世纪20年代流入了这座城市。而现在这场新的骚乱甚至让这些钱也停止了流动。现在，来到哈莱姆的白人游客——大多数是在周末夜晚——只有几十人，他们来到这里是为了跳扭摆舞、节俭消费、跳Watusi舞等等，这些都是Small's Paradise中的当前舞蹈热潮，该场所现在由篮球冠军“高跷”张伯伦拥有，他以自己高大、干净、全美国运动员的形象吸引了众多人群。今天，大多数白人都不敢来哈莱姆——这也是有充分理由的。即使是黑人，哈莱姆的夜生活也已经结束了。大多数有钱可花的黑人都在市中心的一些虚伪的“融合”场所花钱，而这些地方以前警察会叫来把任何疯狂的黑人拖走。这些已经富有的白人无法在这些疯狂的黑人之前完成另一座摩天大楼酒店的建造和开放，而那些黑人自己也没有工具棚可以预订这些豪华的新酒店进行“舞会”和“会议”。当这些富有的白人把钱扔在哈莱姆时，他们曾经负担得起。但现在黑人不能把他们的钱带到市中心给白人了。

Sammy and I, on a robbery job, got a bad scare, a very close call. 
萨米和我一起，在一次抢劫任务中，遇到了一场非常惊险的遭遇。
Things had grown so tight in Harlem that some hustlers had been forced to go to work. Evensome prostitutes had gotten jobs as domestics, and cleaning office buildings at night. Thepimping was so poor, Sammy had gone on the job with me. We had selected one of thosesituations considered "impossible." But wherever people think that, the guards will unconsciouslygrow gradually more relaxed, until sometimes those can be the easiest jobs of all. 
哈莱姆的生活变得如此拮据，以至于一些街头小贩被迫去找工作。甚至一些妓女也得到了家庭佣工和夜间清洁办公楼的工作。皮条生意非常不好，所以萨米和我一起工作。我们选择了那些被认为是“不可能”的任务之一。但是无论人们怎么想，警卫们会逐渐变得更加放松警惕，有时这些任务会变得最容易。
But right in the middle of the act, we had some bad luck. A bullet grazed Sammy. We just barelyescaped. 
但是就在行动进行到一半的时候，我们遭遇了一些不幸。一颗子弹擦过了萨米的身体。我们侥幸逃脱了。
 Sammy fortunately wasn't really hurt. We split up, which was always wise to do. 
幸运的是，萨米并没有受伤。我们分头行动，这是明智的选择。
Just before daybreak, I went to Sammy's apartment. His newest woman, one of those beautifulbut hot-headed Spanish Negroes, was in there crying and carrying on over Sammy. She went forme, screaming and clawing; she knew I'd been in on it with him. I fended her off. Not able tofigure out why Sammy didn't shut her up, I did . . . and from the corner of my eye, I saw Sammygoing for his gun. 
天快亮的时候，我去了萨米的公寓。他的新女友，一个漂亮但脾气暴躁的西班牙黑人，在里面哭泣并责备萨米。她冲向我，尖叫着抓我，她知道我和萨米一起干的这件事。我把她推开了。由于不明白为什么萨米不让她闭嘴，我就……突然，我从眼角看到萨米拿起了他的枪。
Sammy's reaction that way to my hitting his woman-close as he and I were-was the only weakspot I'd ever glimpsed. The woman screamed and dove for him. She knew as I did that when yourbest friend draws a gun on you, he usually has lost all control of his emotions, and he intends toshoot. She distracted Sammy long enough for me to bolt through the door. Sammy chased me,about a block. 
萨米因为我打了他的女人而做出的反应——就像我和他一样亲密——是我唯一一次看到他的弱点。那个女人尖叫着扑向他，她知道我和萨米都知道，当你最好的朋友对你拔出枪时，他已经失去了对自己情绪的控制，并且打算开枪。她分散了萨米的注意力足够长的时间让我逃了出去。萨米追了我大约一个街区。
We soon made up-on the surface. But things never are fully right again with anyone you haveseen trying to kill you. 
我们很快表面上和好了。但是，如果你见过有人试图杀死你，事情就永远不会再完全对好了。
Intuition told us that we had better lay low for a good while. The worst thing was that we'd beenseen. The police in that nearby town had surely circulated our general descriptions. 
我们的直觉告诉我们最好暂时躲起来。最糟糕的是我们已经被人看到了。附近城镇的警察肯定已经传遍了我们的大致描述。
I just couldn't forget that incident over Sammy's woman. I came to rely more and more upon mybrother Reginald as the only one in my world I could completely trust. 
我无法忘记萨米的女人事件。我越来越依赖我的兄弟雷金纳德，他是我唯一可以完全信任的人。
Reginald was lazy, I'd discovered that. He had quit his hustle altogether. But I didn't mind that,really, because one could be as lazy as he wanted, if he would only use his head, as Reginaldwas doing. He had left my apartment by now.He was living off his "old settler" woman-when hewas in town. I had also taught Reginald how he could work a little while for a railroad, then usehis identification card to travel for nothing-and Reginald loved to travel. Several times, he hadgone visiting all around, among our brothers and sisters. They had now begun to scatter todifferent cities. In Boston, Reginald was closer to our sister Mary man to Ella, who had been myfavorite. Both Reginald and Mary were quiet types, and Ella and I were extroverts. And Shorty inBoston had given my brother a royal time. 
我发现雷金纳德很懒，他已经彻底放弃了他的街头小贩生意。但我并不介意，因为一个人可以像他想要的那么懒，如果他用脑子思考的话，就像雷金纳德正在做的那样。现在他已经离开了我的公寓。当他在城里的时候，他靠着他的“老定居者”女人生活。我也教过雷金纳德如何为铁路工作一段时间，然后使用他的身份证明免费旅行-雷金纳德喜欢旅行。他多次去拜访我们兄弟姐妹中的每一个人。他们现在已经开始分散到不同的城市了。在波士顿，雷金纳德更接近我们的姐姐玛丽，她和埃拉关系更好，埃拉一直是我最喜欢的人。雷金纳德和玛丽都是安静的人，而埃拉和我则是外向的人。而在波士顿的Shorty给我哥哥度过了一段美好的时光。
Because of my reputation, it was easy for me to get into the numbers racket. That was probablyHarlem's only hustle which hadn't slumped in business. In return for a favor to some whitemobster, my new boss and his wife had just been given a six-months numbers banking privilegefor the Bronx railroad area called Motthaven Yards. The white mobsters had the numbers racketsplit into specific areas. A designated area would be assigned to someone for a specified periodof time. My boss's wife had been Dutch Schultz's secretary in the 1930's, during the time whenSchultz had strong-armed his way into control of the Harlem numbers business. 
由于我的名声，我很容易就能进入数字赌博行业。这可能是哈莱姆唯一没有衰落的生意。作为对某个白人暴徒的回报，我的新老板和他的妻子刚刚获得了为期六个月的数字银行业务特权，服务于布朗克斯铁路区域叫做Motthaven Yards。白人暴徒将数字赌博分成了特定的区域。一个指定的区域将被分配给某人一段特定时间。我老板的妻子在20世纪30年代是Dutch Schultz的秘书，当时Schultz通过强力手段控制了哈莱姆的数字赌博业务。
My job now was to ride a bus across the George Washington Bridge where a fellow was waitingfor me to hand him a bag of numbers betting slips. We never spoke. I'd cross the street and catchthe next bus back to Harlem. I never knew who that fellow was. I never knew who picked up thebetting money for the slips that I handled. You didn't ask questions in the rackets. 
我现在的工作是在乔治·华盛顿桥上乘坐一辆巴士，有一个人在那里等我递给他一袋数字赌博的下注单。我们从不交谈。我会穿过马路，赶上下一班返回哈莱姆的公交车。我从不知道那个人是谁。我也不知道是谁拿走了我处理的那些下注单的钱。在赌博中，你从不问问题。
My boss's wife and Gladys Hampton were the only two women I ever met in Harlem whosebusiness ability I really respected. My boss's wife, when she had the time and the inclination totalk, would tell me many interesting things. She would talk to me about the Dutch Schultz days- about deals that she had known, about graft paid to officials-rookie cops and shyster lawyers righton up into the top levels of police and politics. She knew from personal experiencehow crimeexisted only to the degree that the law cooperated with it. She showed me how, in the country'sentire social, political and economic structure, the criminal, the law, and the politicians wereactually inseparable partners. 
我老板的妻子和Gladys Hampton是我在哈莱姆遇到的两个我真正尊重其商业能力的女性。我老板的妻子，当她有时间和兴趣交谈时，会告诉我许多有趣的事情。她会跟我谈论Dutch Schultz时代- 她知道的交易，贿赂官员的贪污行为——从新手警察到无耻律师一直到最高级别的警察和政治人物。她从个人经历中了解到犯罪存在的程度，即法律与犯罪之间的合作程度。她向我展示了在这个国家的感性社会、政治和经济结构中，罪犯、法律和政治人物实际上是不可分割的伙伴。
It was at this time that I changed from my old numbers man, the one I'd used since I first workedin Small's Paradise. He hated to lose a heavy player, but he readily understood why I would nowwant to play with a runner of my own outfit. That was how I began placing my bets with WestIndian Archie. I've mentioned him before-one of Harlem's really _bad_ Negroes; one of thoseformer Dutch Schultz strong-arm men around Harlem. 
正是在这个时候，我从我旧的数字人那里改变了，那个自从我第一次在Small的天堂工作以来就一直使用的人。他讨厌失去一个重量级选手，但他很乐意理解为什么我现在想和我自己的组织里的跑者一起玩游戏了。这就是我开始用西印度群岛的阿尔奇下注的方式。我之前提到过他——哈莱姆真正糟糕的黑人之一；那些曾经在哈莱姆拥有Dutch Schultz强大势力的人之一。
West Indian Archie had finished time in Sing Sing not long before I came to Harlem. But myboss's wife had hired him not just because she knew him from the old days. West Indian Archiehad the kind of photographic memory that put him among the elite of numbers runners. He neverwrote down your number; even in the case of combination plays, he would just nod. He was ableto file all the numbers in his head, and write them down for the banker only when he turned in hismoney. This made him the ideal runner because cops could never catch him with any bettingslips. 
西印度群岛的阿尔奇在我来哈莱姆之前不久，刚刚在辛辛监狱服完刑。但我老板的妻子不仅因为他在旧日里就认识他而雇用了他。西印度群岛的阿尔奇有一种照相记忆能力，这使他成为数字赌博跑者中的精英之一。他从不在纸条上写下你的号码；即使在组合游戏的情况下，他只是点头示意。他能够在脑海中记住所有的数字，只有在交出他的钱时才会将它们写下来交给银行家。这使得他成为理想的跑步者，因为警察永远无法抓住他任何下注单。
I've often reflected upon such black veteran numbers men as West Indian Archie.  If they had livedin another kind of society, their exceptional mathematical talents might have been better used.But they were black. 
我经常思考像西印度群岛的阿尔奇这样的黑人老手。如果他们生活在另一种社会中，他们的非凡数学才能可能会得到更好的利用。但他们是黑人。
Anyway, it was status just to be known as a client of West Indian Archie's, because he handledonly sizable bettors. He also required integrity and sound credit: it wasn't necessary that you payas you played; you could pay West Indian Archie by the week. He always carried a couple ofthousand dollars on him, his own money. If a client came up to him and said he'd hit for somemoderate amount, say a fifty-cent or one-dollar combination, West Indian Archiewould peel off thethree or six hundred dollars, and later get his money back from the banker. 
无论如何，被称为西印度群岛阿尔奇的客户都是有身份的，因为他只处理有足够资金的玩家。他还要求诚信和良好的信用：你不必随着你的下注而支付；你可以按周向西印度群岛阿尔奇支付。他总是随身携带几千美元，这是他自己的钱。如果一个客户走过来说他打算下注某个适度的数目，比如50美分或1美元的组合，西印度群岛阿尔奇会拿出300到600美元，然后从银行家那里拿回他的钱。
Every weekend, I'd pay my bill-anywhere from fifty to even one hundred dollars, if I had reallyplunged on some hunch. And when, once or twice, I did hit, always just some combination, as I'vedescribed, West Indian Archie paid me off from his own roll. 
每个周末，如果我下注一些预感中的大赌注，我就会支付我的账单——50到甚至100美元。而且一旦一两次我赢了，总是像我之前所描述的那样，只是一些组合，西印度群岛阿尔奇会用他自己的现金支付我。
The six months finally ended for my boss and his wife. They had done well. Their runners got nicetips, and promptly were snatched up by other bankers. I continued working for my boss and hiswife in a gambling house they opened. 
我老板和他妻子的六个月终于结束了。他们干得很好。他们的跑步者得到不错的小费，并迅速被其他银行家抢走了。我继续为我老板和他的妻子工作，在他们开的赌场里。

A Harlem madam I'd come to know-through having done a friend of hers a favor-introduced me toa special facet of the Harlem night world, something which the riot had only interrupted. It was theworld where, behind locked doors, Negroes catered to monied white people's weird sexual tastes. 
一位哈莱姆的女士，我通过为她的一位朋友做了一件小事而认识了她，她向我介绍了哈莱姆夜生活的特别方面，这是骚乱只是打断了的事情。这是一个黑人在锁定的门后
The whites I'd known loved to rub shoulders publicly with black folks in the after-hours clubs andspeakeasies. These, on the other hand, were whites who did not want it known that they hadbeen anywhere near Harlem. The riot had made these exclusive white customers nervous. Theirslipping into and about Harlem hadn't been so noticeable when other whites were also around.But now they would be conspicuous; they also feared the recently aroused anger of HarlemNegroes. So the madam was safeguarding her growing operation by offering me a steerer's job. 
我曾经认识的白人喜欢在夜总会和爵士乐酒吧里公开与黑人接触。另一方面，这些人不想让人知道他们曾经去过哈莱姆。骚乱使这些独占的白人客户感到紧张。当其他白人也在场时，他们悄悄地进入哈莱姆并没有那么引人注目。但现在他们会引人注目；他们也害怕最近激起的哈莱姆黑人的愤怒。所以这位女士通过提供给我一个领航员的工作来保护她日益扩大的业务。
During the war, it was extremely difficult to get a telephone. One day the madam told me to stayat my apartment the next morning. She talked to somebody. I don't know who it was, but beforethe next noon, I dialed the madam from my own telephone-unlisted. 
战争期间，要获得一部电话机非常困难。有一天，这位女士告诉我第二天早上呆在我的公寓里。她与某人通话。我不知道是谁，但是直到中午之前，我用自己的电话（未列出号码）拨通了这位女士的电话。
This madam was a specialist in her field. If her own girls could not-or would not-accommodate acustomer, she would send me to another place, usually an apartment somewhere else in Harlem,where the requested "specialty" was done. 
这位女士在她的领域内是专家。如果她自己的女孩不能或不愿意招待客户，她会派我去另一个地方，通常是哈莱姆其他地方的公寓，在那里要求的特殊服务得到了满足。
My post for picking up the customers was right outside the Astor Hotel, that always-busynorthwest comer of 45th Street and Broadway. Watching the moving traffic, I was soon able tospot the taxi, car, or limousine-even before it slowed down-with the anxious white faces peeringout for the tall, reddish-brown-complexioned Negro wearing a dark suit, or raincoat, with a whiteflower in his lapel. 
我接客的地方就在阿斯特尔酒店外，位于45街和百老汇西北角的繁忙地段。看着来来往往的车辆，我很快就能够认出出租车、轿车或豪华轿车——甚至在它减速之前——车里焦急的白人面孔向外张望，寻找那个穿着深色西装或雨衣，翻领上别着一朵白色花的高大、红褐色皮肤的黑人。
If they were in a private car, unless it was chauffeured I would take the wheel and drive where wewere going. But if they were in a taxi, I would always tell the cabbie, "The Apollo Theater inHarlem, please," since among New York City taxis a certain percentage are driven by cops. Wewould get another cab-driven by a black man-and I'd give him the right address. 
如果他们在私人汽车里，除非是司机驾驶的，否则我会接手方向盘并开往我们要去的地方。但如果他们在出租车里，我会总是告诉出租车司机：“请送我们到哈莱姆的阿波罗剧院”，因为在纽约市的出租车中，有一定比例是由警察驾驶的。我们会叫另一辆由黑人驾驶的出租车，然后我会把正确的地址告诉他。
As soon as I got that party settled, I'd telephone the madam. She would generally have me rushby taxi right back downtown to be on the 45th Street and Broadway comer at a specified time.Appointments were strictly punctual; rarely was I on the corner as much as five minutes. And Iknew how to keep moving about so as not to attract the attention of any vice squad plainclothes- men or uniformed cops. 
一旦我安排好了客人，我就会打电话给这位女士。她通常会让我坐出租车马上回到市中心，在指定的时间到达45街和百老汇的拐角处。约定的时间非常准时，我很少会在拐角处停留超过五分钟。我知道如何四处走动，以免引起便衣警察或穿制服的警察的注意。
With tips, which were often heavy, sometimes I would make over a hundred dollars a nightsteering up to ten customers in a party-to see anything, to do anything, to have anything done tothem, that they wanted. I hardly ever knewthe identities of my customers, but the few I didrecognize, or whose names I happened to hear, remind me now of the Profumo case in England.The English are not far ahead of rich and influential Americans when it comes to seeking raritiesand oddities. 
通过小费，我常常能得到丰厚的回报。有时我会在一个晚上带十多个顾客去参加派对，为他们做任何他们想做的事情，看到任何他们想看的东西。我几乎从来不知道我的顾客的身份，但我认识的那几个或者我碰巧听到的名字让我想起英国的Profumo案件。当涉及到寻找稀有和奇特的东西时，英国人比富有而有影响力的美国人要领先一些。
Rich men, middle-aged and beyond, men well past their prime: these weren't college boys, thesewere their Ivy League fathers. Even grandfathers, I guess. Society leaders. Big politicians.Tycoons. Important friends from out of town. City government big shots. All kinds of professionalpeople. Star performing artists. Theatrical and Hollywood celebrities. And, of course, racketeers. 
富有的中年人和老年人，已经过了他们的巅峰：这些不是大学生，而是他们的常春藤盟校的父亲。甚至是祖父，我猜。社会领袖。大政治家。大亨。来自外地的重要朋友。市政府的大人物。各种专业人士。明星表演艺术家。戏剧和好莱坞名人。当然，还有骗子。
Harlem was their sin-den, their fleshpot. They stole off among taboo black people, and took offwhatever antiseptic, important, dignified masks they wore in their white world. These were menwho could afford to spend large amounts of money for two, three, or four hours indulging theirstrange appetites. 
哈莱姆是他们的罪恶之地，他们的肉欲之城。他们在禁忌的黑人中偷偷摸摸，摘下了他们在白色世界中所穿的任何消毒剂、重要或庄严的面具。这些人可以花大笔的钱来满足他们奇怪的嗜好，持续两、三或四个小时。
But in this black-white nether world, nobody judged the customers. Anything they could name,anything they could imagine, anything they could describe, they could do, or could have done tothem, just as long as they paid. 
但在这个黑白交织的世界中，没有人评判顾客。无论他们可以命名什么，无论他们可以想象什么，无论他们可以描述什么，他们可以做任何事情或已经被做了任何事情，只要他们付钱。
In the Profumo case in England, Christine Keeler's friend testified that some of her customerswanted to be whipped. One of my main steers to one specialty address away from the madam'shouse was the apartment of a big, coal-black girl, strong as an ox, with muscles like adockworker's. A funny thing, it generally was the oldest of these white men-in their sixties, I know,some maybe in their seventies-they couldn't seem to recover quickly enough from their lastwhipping so they could have me meet them again at 45th and Broadway to take them back to thatapartment, to cringe on their knees and beg and cry out for mercy under that black girl's whip.Some of them would pay me extra to come and watch them being beaten. That girl greased herbig Amazon body all over to look shinier and blacker. She used small, plaited whips, she woulddrawblood, and she was making herself a small fortune off those old white men. 
在英国的Profumo案件中，克里斯蒂娜·基勒的朋友作证说，她的一些顾客想要被鞭打。我前往这位女士房子外的某个特殊场所的主要导引之一是，一位高大的黑皮肤女孩的公寓，她强壮如牛，肌肉像码头工人一样发达。有趣的是，这些白人男性通常是年纪最大的-我知道他们中有六、七十岁的，有些人可能在七十几岁-他们似乎无法迅速从上次的鞭打中恢复过来，以便我可以再次在百老汇45街与他们会面，带他们回到那个公寓，让他们跪在地上，乞求并呼喊着黑女孩的鞭子下宽恕。其中一些人会额外支付我来观看他们的殴打。那个女孩用光滑的身体润滑她巨大的亚马逊身体，看起来更亮丽和黑色。她使用小编织的鞭子，她会流血，并且正在从那些年长的白人男性身上赚取一笔小财富。
I wouldn't tell all the things I've seen. I used to wonder, later on, when I was in prison, what apsychiatrist would make of it all. And so many of these men held responsible positions; theyexercised guidance, influence, and authority over others. 
我不会说出我所见过的一切。后来，当我在监狱里时，我曾经想知道，一个精神病医生会对这一切有什么看法。而且，这些男人中的许多人都担任着有责任的职位；他们对别人行使指导、影响和权威。
In prison later, I'd think, too, about another thing. Just about all of those whites specificallyexpressed as their preference black, black, "the blacker the better!" The madam, having longsince learned this, had in her house nothing but the blackest accommodating women she couldfind. 
后来，我在监狱里还会想到另一件事情。几乎所有那些白人都明确表示他们更喜欢黑人，黑人，“越黑越好！”这位女士早已了解到这一点，因此在她的房子中只有她能找到的最黑的迎合女性。
In all of my time in Harlem, I never saw a white prostitute touched by a white man. White girlswere in some of the various Harlem specialty places. They would participate in customers' mostfrequent exhibition requests-a sleek, black Negro male having a white woman. Was this the whiteman wanting to witness his deepest sexual fear? A few times, I even had parties that includedwhite women whom the men had brought with them to watch this. I never steered any whitewomen other than in these instances, brought by their own men, or who had been put into contactwith me by a white Lesbian whom I knew, who was another variety of specialty madam. 
在我所有的哈莱姆时间里，我从未见过一个白人妓女被一个白人男子触摸过。白人女孩存在于一些不同的哈莱姆特色场所中。他们会参与顾客最频繁的展览要求-一个光滑、黑人男性与一个白人女性在一起。这是那个想要见证他最深的性恐惧的白人吗？有几次，我甚至举办了包括白人女性的派对，男人们带着她们来观看这个。除了这些情况之外，我从未引导过任何白人女性，除非是他们自己的男人带来的，或者是一个我知道的白人女同性恋者与我联系的，她是一位不同类型的特色夫人。
This Lesbian, a beautiful white woman, had a mate Negro stable. Her vocabulary was allprofanity. She supplied Negro males, on order, to well-to-do white women. 
这位白人女同性恋者有着一个黑人伴侣稳定的关系。她的词汇充满了亵渎。她按照订单向富裕的白人女性提供黑人男性。
I'd seen this Lesbian and her blonde girl friend around Harlem, drinking and talking at bars,always with young Negroes. No one who didn't know would ever guess that the Lesbian wasrecruiting. But one night I gave her and her girl friend some reefers which they said were the bestthey'd ever smoked. They lived in a hotel downtown, and after that, now and then, they would callme,and I would bring them some reefers, and we'd talk. 
我在哈莱姆见过这位女同性恋者和她的金发女友，在酒吧里喝酒聊天，总是和年轻的黑人在一起。没有人会猜到这位女同性恋者是在招募。
She told me how she had accidentally gotten started in her specialty. As a Harlem habitu‚, shehad known Harlem Negroes who liked white women. Her role developed from a pattern of talkshe often heard from bored, well-to-do white women where she worked, in an East Side beautysalon. Hearing the women complain about sexually inadequate mates, she would tell what she'd"heard" about Negro men. Observing how excited some of the women seemed to become, shefinally arranged some dates with some of the Harlem Negroes she knew at her own apartment. 
她告诉我，她是如何偶然开始了她的特色业务的。作为一个哈莱姆的老手，她知道喜欢白人女性的哈莱姆黑人。她的角色是从她在东城美容院工作时常听到的一些无聊、富有的白人女性那里发展而来的谈话模式。听到这些女性抱怨性伴侣不够格时，她会说出她所“听到”的有关黑人男性的事情。观察着一些女性变得多么兴奋，她最终在自己的公寓里安排了一些与她知道的一些哈莱姆黑人的约会。
Eventually, she rented three midtown apartments where a woman customer could meet a Negroby appointment. Her customers recommended her service to their friends. She quit the beautysalon, set up a messenger service as an operating front, and ran all of her business by telephone. 
最终，她租了三套中城公寓，一位女客户可以按预约会见一个黑人。她的客户将她的服务推荐给他们的朋友。她辞去了美容院的工作，成立了一个信使服务作为运营前线，并通过电话经营她的所有业务。
She had also noticed the color preference. I never could substitute in an emergency, she wouldtell me with a laugh, because I was too light. She told me that nearly every white woman in herclientele would specify "a black one"; sometimes they would say "a _real_ one," meaning black,no brown Negroes, no red Negroes. 
她也注意到了颜色偏好。她笑着说，我从来没有在紧急情况下替代过，因为我太浅色了。她告诉我，几乎她的每个白人客户都会指定“一个黑人”；有时候他们会说“一个真正的黑人”，意思是黑色，没有棕色的黑人，也没有红色的黑人。
The Lesbian thought up her messenger service idea because some of her trade wanted theNegroes to come to their homes, at times carefully arranged by telephone. These women lived inneighborhoods of swank brownstones and exclusive apartment houses, with doormen dressedlike admirals. But white society never thinks about challenging any Negro in a servant role.Doormen would telephone up and hear "Oh, yes, send him right up, James"; service elevatorswould speed those neatly dressed Negro messenger boys right up-so that they could "deliver"what had been ordered by some of the most privileged white women in Manhattan.The irony is that those white women had no more respect for those Negroes than white men havehad for the Negro women they have been "using" since slavery times. And, in turn, Negroes haveno respect for the whites they get into bed with. I know the way I felt about Sophia, who still cameto New York whenever I called her. 
这位女同性恋者想出了她的信使服务想法，因为她的一些顾客希望黑人来到他们的家中，有时是通过电话精心安排的。这些女人住在豪华的棕色砖房和高档公寓楼的社区里，门卫穿着像海军上将一样的衣服。但是白人社会从未考虑过挑战任何黑人在仆人的角色中。门卫会打电话听到“哦，是的，让他上来，詹姆斯”；服务电梯会加速那些穿着整齐的黑人信使男孩-这样他们就可以“交付”曼哈顿一些最富有的白人女性所订购的东西。讽刺的是，这些白人女性对那些黑人的尊重并不比白人男性对他们自奴隶时代以来一直“使用”的黑女人尊重。
The West Indian boy friend of the Profumo scandal's Christine Keeler, Lucky Gordon, and hisfriends must have felt the same way. After England's leaders had been with those white girls,those girls, for their satisfaction, went to Negroes, to smoke reefers and make fun of some ofEngland's greatest peers as cuckolds and fools. I don't doubt that Lucky Gordon knows theidentity of "the man in the mask" and much more. If Gordon told everything those white girls toldhim, he would give England a new scandal.It's no different from what happens in some of America's topmost white circles. Twenty years ago,I saw them nightly, with my own eyes, I heard them with my own ears. 
普罗夫莫丑闻中的克里斯汀·基勒、卢基·戈登及其朋友的西印度群岛男友们一定也有同样的感觉。在英国领导人与这些白人女孩在一起之后，为了让自己满意，这些女孩去找黑人，吸食大麻，嘲笑一些英国最伟大的同龄人为绿帽子和傻瓜。我毫不怀疑卢基·戈登知道“戴面具的人”的身份以及更多的事情。如果戈登告诉了那些白人女孩告诉他的一切，他会为英国带来新的丑闻。这与美国一些最高级的白人圈子中发生的事情没有什么不同。二十年前，我亲眼目睹了这些事情，我用自己的眼睛看到了它们，用自己的耳朵听到了它们。
The hypocritical white man will talk about the Negro's "low morals." But who has the world'slowest morals if not whites? And not only that, but the "upper-class" whites! Recently, details werepublished about a group of suburban New York City white housewives and mothers operating asa professional call-girl ring. In some cases, these wives were out prostituting with the agreement,even the cooperation, of husbands, some of whom even waited at home, attending the children.And the customers-to quote a major New York City morning newspaper: "Some 16 ledgers andbooks with names of 200 Johns, many important social, financial and political figures, wereseized in the raid Friday night." 
虚伪的白人会谈论黑人的“道德低下”。但是，如果不是为了白人，谁的道德最差呢？不仅如此，而且是“上层阶级”的白人！最近，有细节被公布，关于一群纽约市郊区的家庭主妇和母亲经营着一个专业的应召女郎团伙。在某些情况下，这些妻子出去卖淫是得到了丈夫的同意，甚至合作，其中一些人甚至在家照看孩子。正如引用纽约市一家主要报纸的话所说，顾客们：“周五晚上的搜查中，大约有16本账簿和名册，上面有200个约翰的名字，许多重要的社会、金融和政治人物都在上面。 ”
I have also read recently about groups of young white couples who gettogether, the husbandsthrow their house keys into a hat, then, blindfolded, the husbands draw out a key and spend thenight with the wife that the house key matches. I have never heard of anything like that beingdone by Negroes, even Negroes who live in the worst ghettoes and alleys and gutters. 
我最近也读到了一些关于年轻白人夫妻聚在一起的故事，丈夫们把他们家的钥匙扔进帽子里，然后丈夫们戴上眼罩，从帽子里抽出一把钥匙，和这把钥匙匹配的老婆共度一夜。我从未听说过黑人做过这样的事情，即使是那些生活在最糟糕的贫民窟、小巷和阴沟里的黑人也没有。
Early one morning in Harlem, a tall, light Negro wearing a hat and with a woman's stocking drawndown over his face held up a Negro bartender and manager who were counting up the night'sreceipts. Like most bars in Harlem, Negroes fronted, and a Jew really owned the place. To get alicense, one had to know somebody in the State Liquor Authority, and Jews working with Jewsseemed to have the best S.L.A. contacts. The black manager hired some Negro hoodlums to gohunting for the hold-up man. And the man's description caused them to include me among theirsuspects. About daybreak that same morning, they kicked in the door of my apartment. 
一天早上在哈莱姆，一个高大的浅色黑人戴着帽子，将女人的长筒袜拉下来遮住了脸，抓住了一个正在清点夜间收据的黑人酒保和经理。像哈莱姆大多数酒吧一样，黑人在前面工作，而这个地方实际上由犹太人拥有。要获得执照，你必须认识国家酒精管理局的某人，而犹太人与犹太人之间的合作似乎拥有最好的酒精管理局联系。这位黑人经理雇佣了一些黑人恶棍来追捕抢劫犯。该男子的描述使他们将我包括在嫌疑人之列。大约在同一天的黎明时分，他们踢开了我公寓的门。
I told them I didn't know a thing about it, that I hadn't had a thing to do with whatever they weretalking about. I told them I had been out on my hustle, steering, until maybe four in the morning,and then I had come straight to my apartment and gone to bed. 
我告诉他们我对此一无所知，与他们谈论的事情没有任何关系。我告诉他们我一直在外面忙碌着，直到凌晨四点才回家，然后直接回到我的公寓睡觉了。
The strong-arm thugs were bluffing. They were trying to flush out the man who had done it. Theystill had other suspects to check out-that's all that saved me. 
这些强权恶棍们只是在虚张声势。他们试图将罪犯逼出来。他们还有其它的嫌疑人需要调查-这就是救了我的原因。
I put on my clothes and took a taxi and I woke up two people, the madam, then Sammy. I hadsome money, but the madam gave me some more, and I told Sammy I was going to see mybrother Philbert in Michigan. I gave Sammy the address, so that he could let me know whenthings got straightened out. 
我穿上衣服，打了一辆出租车，醒了两个女人，一个是老板娘，另一个是萨米。我有一些钱，但是老板娘给了我更多的钱，我告诉萨米我要去密歇根州看我的兄弟菲尔伯特。我给了萨米地址，这样他可以在事情解决后通知我。
This was the trip to Michigan in the wintertime when I put congolene on my head, then discoveredthat the bathroom sink's pipes were frozen. To keep thelye from burning up my scalp, I had tostick my head into the stool and flush and flush to rinse out the stuff. 
那是在冬天我去了密歇根州，我把刚果红涂在头上，然后发现浴室的水槽管道被冻住了。为了避免烧焦我的头皮，我不得不把头伸进马桶里冲水冲洗掉这些东西。
A week passed in frigid Michigan before Sammy's telegram came. Another red Negro hadconfessed, which enabled me to live in Harlem again. 
在寒冷的密歇根州度过了一个星期后，萨米终于来了电报。又有另一个黑人供认不讳，这让我能够再次回到哈莱姆。
But I didn't go back into steering. I can't remember why I didn't. I imagine I must have felt likestaying away from hustling for a while, going to some of the clubs at night, and narcotizing withmy friends. Anyway, I just never went back to the madam's job. 
但是我没有回到舵手的工作。我不记得为什么没有回去。我想我可能是想暂时远离赌博，晚上去一些俱乐部，和朋友们一起麻醉自己。无论如何，我再也没有回去做老板娘的工作了。
It was at about this time, too, I remember, that I began to be sick. I had colds all the time. It got tobe a steady irritation, always sniffling and wiping my nose, all day, all night. I stayed so high that Iwas in a dream world. Now, sometimes, I smoked opium with some white friends, actors wholived downtown. And I smoked more reefers than ever before. I didn't smoke the usual wooden- match-sized sticks of marijuana. I was so far gone by now that I smoked it almost by the ounce. 
我还记得，大约在这个时候，我开始生病了。我总是感冒。它成为了一种持续的刺激性感觉，整天都在咳嗽和擦鼻子，不管是白天还是晚上。我保持高的状态，进入了一个梦境世界。现在，有时候我和一些住在市中心的白人朋友一起抽鸦片。而且我抽的卷烟比以前任何时候都多。
*     *     * 
After awhile, I worked downtown for a Jew. He liked me because of something I had managed todo for him. He bought rundown restaurants and bars. Hymie was his name. He would remodelthese places, then stage a big, gala reopening, with banners and a spotlight outside. The jam- packed, busy place with the big "Under New Management" sign in the window would attractspeculators, usually other Jews who were around looking for something to invest money in.Sometimes even in the week of the new opening, Hymie would re-sell, at a good profit. 
过了一段时间，我在市中心为一个犹太人工作。他喜欢我，因为我为他完成了一些事情。他购买了破旧的餐馆和酒吧。海米是他的名字。他会重新装修这些地方，然后举行盛大的重新开业典礼，外面挂满了横幅和聚光灯。挤满人的、繁忙的地方，窗口里贴着“新管理层”的大牌子，会吸引投机者，通常是其他犹太投资者在寻找可以投资的东西。有时甚至在开业的那个星期内，海米也会再次出售，赚取可观的利润。
Hymie really liked me, and I liked him. He loved to talk. I loved to listen. Halfhis talk was aboutJews and Negroes. Jews who had anglicized their names were Hymie's favorite hate. Spittingand curling his mouth in scorn, he would reel off names of people he said had done this. Some ofthem were famous names whom most people never thought of as Jews. 
海米真的很喜欢我，我也喜欢他。他喜欢说话。我喜欢听。他的谈话有一半是关于犹太人和黑人的。名字英语化的犹太人是海米最讨厌的人。他轻蔑地吐着唾沫，撇着嘴，滔滔不绝地说出他所说的做过这件事的人的名字。他们中的一些人很有名，但大多数人从未认为他们是犹太人。
"Red, I'm a Jew and you're black," he would say. "These Gentiles don't like either one of us. If theJew wasn't smarter than the Gentile, he'd get treated worse than your people." 
“红皮肤的，我是犹太人，你是黑人，”他会说。 “这些异教徒不喜欢我们两个中的任何一个。如果犹太人不比异教徒聪明，他会受到比你的人更糟糕的待遇。”
Hymie paid me good money while I was with him, sometimes two hundred and three hundreddollars a week. I would have done anything for Hymie. I did do all kinds of things. But my main jobwas transporting bootleg liquor that Hymie supplied, usually to those spruced-up bars which hehad sold to someone. 
海米付给我很好的报酬，有时每周200到300美元。我为海米做了任何事情。我确实做各种各样的事情。但我的主要工作是运输海米提供的私酿酒，通常是那些被他卖给某人的翻新后的酒吧。
Another fellow and I would drive out to Long Island where a big bootleg whisky outfit operated.We'd take with us cartons of empty bonded whisky bottles that were saved illegally by bars wesupplied. We would buy five-gallon containers of bootleg, funnel it into the bottles, then deliver,according to Hymie's instructions, this or that many crates back to the bars. 
我和另一个家伙会开车去长岛，那里有一个大型私酿酒厂在运作。我们会带上由我们所供应的酒吧非法保存的空保税威士忌瓶箱。我们会购买五加仑装的私酿酒，倒入瓶中，然后根据海米的指示将这个或那个数量的箱子运送回酒吧。
Many people claiming they drank only such-and-such a brand couldn't tell their only brand frompure week-old Long Island bootleg. Most ordinary whisky drinkers are "brand" chumps like this.On the side, with Hymie's approval, I was myself at that time supplying some lesser quantities ofbootleg to reputable Harlem bars, as well as to some of the few speakeasies still in Harlem. 
许多人声称他们只喝某种品牌的酒，却无法区分他们唯一喝的纯长岛私酿酒和仅一周新鲜的保税威士忌。大多数普通威士忌饮者都是“品牌”白痴，就像这些人一样。在海米批准的情况下，我本人当时向一些有声望的哈莱姆酒吧以及哈莱姆仍然存在的少数地下酒吧供应了一些数量较少的私酿酒。
But one weekend on Long Island, something happened involving the State Liquor Authority. Oneof New York State's biggest recent scandals has been the exposure of wholesale S.L.A. graft andcorruption. In the bootleg racket Iwas involved in, someone high up must have been taken for areal pile. A rumor about some "inside" tipster spread among Hymie and the others. One dayHymie didn't show up where he had told me to meet him . I never heard from him again . . . but Idid hear that he was put in the ocean and I knew he couldn't swim. 
但是一个周末在长岛，发生了涉及州酒类管理局的一些事情。纽约州最近最大的丑闻之一是揭露批发S.L.A.的贪污腐败。在我参与的私酿酒业中，一定有高层人士被当作了实际的赃物。关于一些“内部”线人的消息在海米和其他人之间传播开来。有一天，海米没有出现在他告诉我见面的地方。我再也没听到过他的消息……但我听说他被扔进了海里，我知道他不会游泳。
Up in the Bronx, a Negro held up some Italian racketeers in a floating crap game. I heard about iton the wire. Whoever did it, aside from being a fool, was said to be a "tall, light-skinned" Negro,masked with a woman's stocking. It has always made me wonder if that bar stickup had reallybeen solved, or if the wrong man had confessed under beatings. But, anyway, the past suspicionof me helped to revive suspicion of me again. 
在布朗克斯，一个黑人持枪抢劫了一些意大利犯罪团伙。我通过电线听说了这件事。无论谁做了这件事，除了是一个傻瓜之外，据说是一个“高大、皮肤白皙”的黑人，戴着一个女人的袜子面具。这总是让我想知道那次酒吧抢劫是否真的解决了，或者是否在殴打之下，错误的人坦白了。但是无论如何，过去对我怀疑的态度再次引起了对我的怀疑。
Up in Fat Man's Bar on the hill overlooking the Polo Grounds, I had just go ne into a telephonebooth. Everyone in the bar-all over Harlem, in fact-was drinking up, excited about the news thatBranch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers' owner, had just signed Jackie Robinson to play in majorleague baseball, with the Dodgers' farm team in Montreal-which would place the time in the fall of1945. 
在俯瞰着Polo Grounds的山上的“肥佬酒吧”，我刚走进一个电话亭。酒吧里的人——实际上整个哈莱姆的人都在喝酒——都在为布鲁克林道奇队老板布兰奇·瑞基刚刚签下杰基·罗宾逊，让他在蒙特利尔的道奇队农场球队打大联盟棒球而感到兴奋，这将是在1945年秋季。
Earlier in the afternoon, I had collected from West Indian Archie for a fifty-cent combination bet;he had paid me three hundred dollars right out of his pocket. I was telephoning Jean Parks. Jeanwas one of the most beautiful women who ever lived in Harlem. She once sang with SarahVaughan in the Bluebonnets, a quartet that sang with Earl Hines. For a long time, Jean and I hadenjoyed a standing, friendly deal that we'd go out and celebrate when either of us hit thenumbers. Since my last hit, Jean had treated me twice, and we laughed on the phone, glad thatnow I'd treat her to a night out. We arranged to go to a 52nd Street nightclub to hear BillieHoliday, who had been on the road and was just back in New York. 
下午早些时候，我从西印度群岛的阿奇那里收集了一个50美分的组合赌注；他从他的口袋里直接拿出了300美元。我正在打电话给珍·帕克。珍是哈莱姆最美丽的女人之一。她曾经与莎拉·沃恩在蓝鸟四重唱中唱歌，这是一个与厄尔·海恩斯一起演唱的四重唱。长期以来，珍和我享受着一种友好的关系，每当我们中的任何一个人中奖时，我们就会出去庆祝。自从我上一次中奖以来，珍已经请过我两次，我们在电话上笑着，很高兴我现在要请她出去度过一个夜晚。我们安排去第52街的夜总会听比莉·霍利迪，她一直在巡回演出，刚刚回到纽约。
 As I hung up, I spotted the two lean, tough-looking _paisanos_ gazing in at me cooped up in thebooth. 
当我挂断电话时，我注意到两个瘦削、看起来很强壮的 _ paisanos_ 正在注视着我，我被关在电话亭里。
I didn't need any intuition. And I had no gun. A cigarette case was the only thing in my pocket. Istarted easing my hand down into my pocket, to try bluffing . . . and one of them snatched openthe door. They were dark olive, swarthy-featured Italians. I had my hand down into my pocket. 
我不需要任何直觉。而且我没有枪。口袋里只有一支香烟盒。我开始慢慢地把手伸进口袋，试图虚张声势……其中一人猛地打开了门。他们是深色橄榄色皮肤、有着黝黑面部特征的意大利人。我的手还在口袋里。
"Come on outside, we'll hold court," one said. 
“出来吧，我们开庭了，”其中一人说道。
At that moment, a cop walked through the front door. The two thugs slipped out. I never in my lifehave been so glad to see a cop. 
就在这时，一个警察走过前门。两个暴徒溜了出去。我这辈子从来没有这么高兴见到过一个警察。
I was still shaking when I got to the apartment of my friend, Sammy the Pimp, He told me that notlong before, West Indian Archie had been there looking for me. 
我到我朋友山姆的公寓时还在发抖。他告诉我，不久前，西印度群岛的阿奇曾在那里找我。
Sometimes, recalling all of this, I don't know, to tell the truth, how I am alive to tell it today. Theysay God takes care of fools and babies. I've so often thought that Allah was watching over me.Through all of this time of my life, I really _was_ dead-mentally dead. I just didn't know that I was. 
有时候，回想起这些，说实话，我不知道我是如何活到今天的。他们说上帝照顾傻瓜和婴儿。我经常想，阿拉正在看着我。在我一生中的这段时间里，我真的心灵死亡了。我只是不知道我是。
Anyway, to kill time, Sammy and I sniffed some of his cocaine, until the time came to pick up JeanParks, to go down and hear Lady Day. Sammy's having told me about West Indian Archie lookingfor me didn't mean a thing . . . not right then. 
无论如何，为了打发时间，山姆和我吸了一些他的可卡因，直到接 Jean Parks 去听 Lady Day 的时候。山姆告诉我西印度群岛的阿奇来找我并没有任何意义……现在还不是时候。
CHAPTER EIGHT 
第八章
TRAPPEDThere was the knocking at the door. Sammy, lying on his bed in pajamas and a bathrobe, called"Who?" 
第七章敲门声响起。萨米穿着睡衣和浴袍躺在床上，喊道“谁啊？”
When West Indian Archie answered, Sammy slid the round, two-sided shaving mirror under thebed, with what little of the cocaine powder-or crystals, actually-was left, and I opened the door. 
当西印度群岛的阿尔奇回答时，萨米把剩下的少量可卡因粉末（或者晶体）藏在床底下的圆镜里，我开了门。
"Red-I want my money!" 
“雷德我要我的钱！”
A .32-20 is a funny kind of gun.  It's bigger than a .32. But it's not as big as a .38. I had faced downsome dangerous Negroes. But no one who wasn't ready to die messed with West Indian Archie. 
“.32-20”是一种有趣的枪支。它比.32的口径大，但比.38的口径小。我曾经面对过一些危险的黑人，但没有人愿意和准备去死的西印度群岛阿尔奇作对。
I couldn't believe it. He truly scared me. I was so incredulous at what was happening that it washard to form words with my brain and my mouth. 
我不敢相信。他真的吓到我了。我对正在发生的事情感到非常难以置信，以至于我很难用我的脑子和嘴巴说出话来。
"Man-what's the beef?" 
“伙计，怎么了？”
West Indian Archie said he'd thought I was trying something when I'd told him I'd hit, but he'd paidme the three hundred dollars until he could double-check his written betting slips; and, as he'dthought, I hadn't combinated the number I'd claimed, but another. 
西印度群岛阿尔奇说他以为我在试图做什么，当我告诉他我要打的时候，但他付了我三百美元，直到他能核对他的书面赌注单；正如他所想，我没有组合我声称的数字，而是另一个数字。
"Man, you're crazy!" I talked fast; I'd seen out of the corner of my eye Sammy's hand easingunder his pillow where he kept his Army .45. "Archie, smart a man as you're supposed to be,you'd pay somebody who hadn't hit?" 
“伙计，你疯了！”我说话很快；我从眼角看到了萨米的手从枕头下伸了出来，他在那里放着他的陆军0.45口径的手枪。“阿尔奇，作为一个聪明的人，你会付钱给一个没有打过赌的人吗？”
The .32-20 moved, and Sammy froze. West Indian Archie told him, "I ought to shoot you throughthe ear." And he looked back at me. "You don't have my money?"I must have shaken my head. "I'll give you until twelve o'clock tomorrow." And he put his handbehind him and pulled open the door. He backed out, and slammed it. 
.32-20动了起来，萨米僵住了。西印度群岛阿尔奇告诉他：“我应该把你耳朵打穿。”然后他回头看着我说：“你没有我的钱？”我一定是摇了摇头。“我给你十二点的时间。”他把他的手放在身后，打开门。他退了出去，砰的一声关上了门。
*     *     * 
It was a classic hustler-code impasse. The money wasn't the problem. I still had about twohundred dollars of it. Had money been the issue, Sammy could have made up the difference; if itwasn't in his pocket, his women could quickly have raised it. West Indian Archie himself, for thatmatter, would have loaned me three hundred dollars if I'd ever asked him, as many thousands ofdollars of mine as he'd gotten ten percent of. Once, in fact, when he'd heard I was broke, he hadlooked me up and handed me some money and grunted, "Stick this in your pocket." 
这是一种经典的骗子代码僵局。钱不是问题。我还有大约200美元。如果钱是问题，萨米可以弥补差额；如果他的口袋里没有钱，他的女人可以很快地筹集到。西印度群岛阿尔奇本人，就这个问题而言，如果我向他借钱，他会借给我300美元，就像我借给他成千上万美元一样，只要他得到百分之十的收益。事实上，有一次当他听说我破产时，他找到了我，递给我一些钱，咕哝着说：“把钱放进你的口袋里。”
The issue was the position which his action had put us both into. For a hustler in our sidewalkjungle wor ld, "face" and "honor" were important. No hustler could have it known that he'd been"hyped," meaning outsmarted or made a fool of. And worse, a hustler could never afford to have itdemonstrated that he could be bluffed, that he could be frightened by a threat, that he lackednerve. 
问题是他的行为让我们两个人都陷入了尴尬的境地。对于我们在人行道丛林世界中的骗子来说，“面子”和“荣誉”是非常重要的。没有骗子会让他知道自己被“骗了”，意味着被聪明地欺骗或愚弄了。更糟糕的是，骗子永远不能让自己被证明可以被虚张声势吓倒，可以被威胁吓倒，缺乏勇气。
West Indian Archie knew that some young hustlers rose in stature in our world when theysomehow hoodwinked older hustlers, then put it on the wire for everyone to hear. He believed Iwas trying that. 
西印度群岛阿尔奇知道，在我们的世界中，一些年轻的骗子通过某种方式欺骗了老练的骗子，然后将其公之于众，以此提高自己的地位。他认为我正在尝试这样做。
In turn, I knew he would be protecting his stature by broadcasting all over the wire his threat tome. 
反过来，我知道他会通过在电线上广播他的威胁来保护自己的地位。
Because of this code, in my time in Harlem I'd personally known a dozen hustlers who,threatened, left town, disgraced.Once the wire had it, any retreat by either of us was unthinkable. The wire would be awaiting thereport of the showdown. 
因为这个代码，我在哈莱姆的时候亲自认识十几个骗子，他们受到威胁后离开了城镇，声名狼藉。一旦电线上有这个消息，我们中的任何一个人的撤退都是不可想象的。电线将等待着摊牌的报道。
I'd also known of at least another dozen showdowns in which one took the Dead On Arrival ride tothe morgue, and the other went to prison for manslaughter or the electric chair for murder. 
我还知道至少另外十几次摊牌，其中一次是有人乘坐“死者到达”的电车前往太平间，而另一个人则因过失杀人或谋杀被送进监狱。
Sammy let me hold his .32. My guns were at my apartment. I put the .32 in my pocket, with myhand on it, and walked out. 
萨米让我拿着他的.32手枪。我的枪在公寓里。我把.32放在口袋里，用手扶着它，然后走了出去。
I couldn't stay out of sight. I had to show up at all of my usual haunts. I was glad that Reginaldwas out of town. He might have tried protecting me, and I didn't want him shot in the head byWest Indian Archie. 
我无法躲藏。我必须出现在所有我经常出没的地方。我很高兴雷金纳德不在这个城市。他可能会试图保护我，而我不想他被西印度群岛阿尔奇枪杀在头上。
I stood awhile on the corner, with my mind confused-the muddled thinking that's characteristic ofthe addict. Was West Indian Archie, I began to wonder, bluffing a hype on me? To make fun ofme? Some old hustlers did love to hype younger ones. I knew he wouldn't do it as some would,just to pick up three hundred dollars. But everyone was so slick. In this Harlem jungle peoplewould hype their brothers. Numbers runners often had hyped addicts who had hit, who were sodrugged that, when challenged, they really couldn't be sure if they had played a certain number. 
我站在街角，脑子里一片混乱——这是吸毒成瘾者的典型思维。我开始怀疑西印度群岛阿尔奇是不是在对我虚张声势？还是在嘲笑我？有些老骗子确实喜欢对年轻的骗子进行虚张声势。我知道他不会像有些人那样只是为了赚三百美元而虚张声势。但每个人都太狡猾了。在这个哈莱姆的丛林里，人们会对他们的弟弟进行虚张声势。数字赌博的人经常对那些已经输了钱、被迷住了的人进行虚张声势，以至于当受到挑战时，他们真的无法确定自己是否玩了某个特定的数字。
I began to wonder whether West Indian Archie might not be right. Had I really gotten mycombination confused? I certainly knew the two numbers I'd played; I knew I'd told him to com- binate only one of them. Had I gotten mixed up about which number? 
我开始怀疑西印度群岛阿尔奇是否说对了。我真的把我的号码组合混淆了吗？我当然知道我玩的两个数字；我知道我只告诉他要组合其中一个数字。我是否把哪个数字搞混了？
Have you ever been so sure you did something that you never would have thought of it again- unless it was brought up again? Then you start trying tomentally confirm-and you're only abouthalf-sure? 
你有没有曾经非常确定自己做了某件事情，直到被再次提起才会想起这件事？然后你开始尝试在心理上确认，但是你只有大约一半的把握？
It was just about tune for me to go and pick up Jean Parks, to go downtown to see Billie at theOnyx Club. So much was swirling in my head. I thought about telephoning her and calling it off,making some excuse. But I knew that running now was the worst thing I could do. So I went onand picked up Jean at her place. We took a taxi on down to 52nd Street. "_Billie Holiday_" andthose big photo blow-ups of her were under the lights outside. Inside, the tables were jammedagainst the wall, tables about big enough to get two drinks and four elbows on; the Onyx was oneof those very little places. 
对我来说，去接琼·帕克斯，去市中心的onyx俱乐部看比莉是一件很合适的事情。我的头脑中充满了各种想法。我想打电话给她，取消这个约会，找一些借口。但我知道现在逃避是最糟糕的事情。所以我继续前行，并在她的地方接上了琼。我们乘出租车去了52街。外面“比莉·霍利迪”和那些大照片海报被灯光照亮着。里面，桌子挤在墙上，每张桌子都足够放两杯饮料和四个手臂；onyx是那种非常小的地方之一。
Billie, at the microphone, had just f inished a number when she saw Jean and me . Her white gownglittered under the spotlight, her face had that coppery, Indianish look, and her hair was in thattrademark ponytail. For her next number she did the one she knew I always liked so: "You Don'tKnow What Love Is"-"until you face each dawn with sleepless eyes . . . until you've lost a love youhate to lose-" 
比莉在麦克风前刚刚结束了一首歌，这时她看到了我和琼。她的白色礼服在聚光灯下闪闪发光，她的脸有着铜色和印第安特色，她的头发是那个标志性的马尾辫。为了下一个节目，她唱了一首我知道我总喜欢的歌：“你不知道什么是爱——直到你用失眠的眼睛面对每一个黎明……直到你失去了一个你不想失去的爱……”
When her set was done, Billie came over to our table. She and Jean, who hadn't seen each otherin a long time, hugged each other. Billie sensed something wrong with me. She knew that I wasalways high, but she knew me well enough to see that something else was wrong, and asked inher customary profane language what was the matter with me. And in my own foul vocabulary ofthose days, I pretended to be without a care, so she let it drop. 
当她的演出结束后，比莉走到我们的桌子旁。她和长时间未见的琼拥抱在一起。比莉感觉到我有些不对劲。她知道我总是很兴奋，但她足够了解我，知道我有些其他的问题，并用她习惯的脏话问我出了什么问题。在那些日子里，我用自己糟糕的词汇假装毫不在意，所以她就放弃了追问。
We had a picture taken by the club photographer that night. The three of us were sitting closetogether. That was the last time I ever saw Lady Day. She's dead; dope and heartbreak stoppedthat heart as big as a barn and that sound and style that no one successfully copies. Lady Daysang with the _soul_ of Negroes from the centuries of sorrow and oppression. What a shame thatproud,fine, black woman never lived where the true greatness of the black race was appreciated! 
那天晚上，我们被俱乐部的摄影师拍了一张合影。我们三个人紧挨着坐在一起。那是我最后一次见到黛小姐。她已经去世了；毒品和心碎停止了那颗像谷仓一样大的心跳动，那种声音和风格没有人能够成功复制。黛小姐唱出了几个世纪来悲伤和压迫中的黑人的灵魂。多么可惜啊，这个自豪、优美、黑人女性从来没有生活过一个真正欣赏到黑人种族的伟大的地方！
In the Onyx Club men's room, I sniffed the little packet of cocaine I had gotten from Sammy. Jeanand I, riding back up to Harlem in a cab, decided to have another drink. She had no idea whatwas happening when she suggested one of my main hangouts, the bar of the La Marr-Cheri onthe corner of 147th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. I had my gun, and the cocaine courage, and Isaid okay. And by the time we'd had the drink, I was so high that I asked Jean to take a cab onhome, and she did. I never have seen Jean again, either. 
在onyx俱乐部的男厕所里，我闻了一下从萨米那里拿到的小包可卡因。我和琼一起坐出租车回到哈莱姆，我们决定再喝一杯。当她建议我去她不知道的一个我常去的地方时——位于147街和圣尼古拉斯大道拐角处的拉马尔奇·切丽酒吧——她并不知道会发生什么。我拿着枪，吸着可卡因壮胆，同意了。当我们喝完酒后，我变得非常兴奋，让珍妮打车回家，她也照做了。我再也没见过珍妮了。
Like a fool, I didn't leave the bar. I stayed there, sitting, like a bigger fool, with my back to thedoor, thinking about West Indian Archie. Since that day, I have never sat with my back to a door- and I never will again. But it's a good thing I was then. I'm positive if I'd seen West Indian Archiecome in, I'd have shot to kill. 
像傻瓜一样，我没有离开酒吧。我留在那里坐着，更像个傻瓜一样，背对着门，想着西印度群岛阿尔奇。从那天起，我再也不会背对着门坐着了——而且我永远不会再这样做了。但当时我很好。我很确定如果我看到了西印度群岛阿尔奇进来，我会开枪打死他。
The next thing I knew West Indian Archie was standing before me, cursing me, loud, his gun onme. He was really making his public point, floor-showing for the people. He called me foul names,threatened me. 
接下来我知道西印度群岛阿尔奇站在我面前，大声地诅咒我，他的枪对着我。他真的在公开表达自己的观点，向观众展示。他叫我卑鄙的名字，威胁我。
Everyone, bartenders and customers, sat or stood as though carved, drinks in mid-air. Thejuke box, in the rear, was going. I had never seen West Indian Archie high before. Not a whiskyhigh, I could tell it was something else. I knew the hustlers' characteristic of keying up on dope todo a job. 
每个人都像雕刻一样坐着或站着，空中拿着饮料。后部的唱片机里放着音乐。我以前从未见过西印度群岛阿尔奇喝醉过。很明显这不是威士忌酒，我能看出是别的东西。我知道骗子们通过吸食毒品来增强工作能力的特点。
I was thinking, "I'm going to kill Archie . . . I'm just going to wait until he turns around-to get thedrop on him." I could feel my own .32 resting against my ribs where it was tucked under my belt,beneath my coat. 
我在想：“我要杀了阿尔奇……我要等到他转过身来，趁他不注意的时候……”我能感受到自己放在内衣里的.32口径手枪。它藏在我的皮带和外套下面。
 West Indian Archie, seeming to read my mind, quit cursing. And his words jarred me. 
西印度群岛阿尔奇似乎读出了我的想法，停止了咒骂。他的话让我感到震惊。
"You're thinking you're going to kill me first, Red. But I'm going to give you something to thinkabout. I'm sixty. I'm an old man. I've been to Sing Sing. My life is over. You're a young man. Killme, you're lost anyway. All you can do is go to prison."I've since thought that West Indian Archie may have been trying to scare me into running, to saveboth his face and his life. It may be that's why he was high. No one knew that I hadn't killedanyone, but no one who knew me, including myself, would doubt that I'd kill. 
“你想着你要先杀了我，瑞德。但我要给你点思考的东西。我已经60岁了，我是个老人。我去过辛辛那提。我的生命已经结束了。你还年轻。杀了我，你也活不成了。你唯一能做的就是进监狱。”
从那以后，我想西印度群岛阿尔奇可能是想吓唬我逃跑，以保全他的面子和生命。也许这就是他为什么吸食毒品的原因。没有人知道我没有杀过任何人，但包括我自己在内，没有人怀疑我会杀人。
I can't guess what might have happened. But under the code, if West Indian Archie had gone outof the door, after having humiliated me as he had, I'd have had to follow him out. We'd have shotit out in the street. 
我无法猜测会发生什么。但是根据规定，如果西印度群岛阿尔奇走出门，在羞辱了我之后，我必须跟随他。我们会在街上开枪。
But some friends of West Indian Archie moved up alongside him, quietly calling his name, "Archie. . . Archie." 
但是西印度群岛阿尔奇的一些朋友悄悄地走到他身边，轻声地呼唤着他的名字：“阿尔奇……阿尔奇。”
And he let them put their hands on him-and they drew him aside. I watched them move him pastwhere I was sitting, glaring at me. They were working him back toward the rear. 
他让他们把手放在他身上——他们把他拉到一边。我看着他们把他移动到我之前坐着的地方，怒视着我。他们正在把他带回后方。
Then, taking my time, I got down off the stool. I dropped a bill on the bar for the bartender.Without looking back, I went out. 
然后，我慢慢地从凳子上下来。我在吧台上放下一张钞票给酒保。我没有回头，就出去了。
I stood outside, in full view of the bar, with my hand in my pocket, for perhaps five minutes. WhenWest Indian Archie didn't come out, I left. 
我站在酒吧外面，完全被看到，把手放在口袋里，也许5分钟。当西印度群岛阿尔奇没有出来时，我离开了。
*     *     *
It must have been five in the morning when, downtown, I woke up a white actor I knew who livedin the Howard Hotel on 45th Street, off Sixth Avenue. 
一定是在早上五点钟左右，当我在市中心醒来时，我遇到了一位住在西45街霍华德酒店的白人演员。他住在第六大道的尽头。
I knew I had to stay high. 
我知道我必须保持清醒。
The amount of dope I put into myself within the next several hours sounds inconceivable. I gotsome opium from that fellow. I took a cab back up to my apartment and I smoked it. My gun wasready if I heard a mosquito cough. 
接下来的几个小时里我吸食的毒品数量听起来令人难以置信。我从那个家伙那里得到了一些鸦片。我乘出租车回到我的公寓，然后吸食了它。我的枪已经准备好了，只要听到一只蚊子咳嗽的声音就会射击。
My telephone rang. It was the white Lesbian who lived downtown. She wanted me to bring herand her girl friend fifty dollars worth of reefers. 
我的电话响了。是住在市中心的那个白人女同性恋者。她想要我给她和她的女伴带来50美元的毒品。
I felt that if I had always done it, I had to do it now. Opium had me drowsy. I had a bottle ofbenzedrine tablets in my bathroom; I swallowed some of them to perk up. The two drugs workingin me had my head going in opposite directions at the same time.I knocked at the apartment right behind mine. The dealer let me have loose marijuana on credit.He saw I was so high that he even helped me roll it-a hundred sticks. And while we were rolling it,we both smoked some. 
我感觉如果我一直这样做，我就必须现在这样做。
Now opium, benzedrine, reefers. 
现在有鸦片、苯丙胺、卷烟
I stopped by Sammy's on the way downtown. His flashing-eyed Spanish Negro woman openedthe door. Sammy had gotten weak for that woman. He had never let any other of his women hangaround so much; now she was even answering his doorbell. Sammy was by this time very badlyaddicted. He seemed hardly to recognize me. Lying in bed, he reached under and again broughtout that inevitable shaving mirror on which, for some reason, he always kept his cocaine crystals.He motioned for me to sniff some. I didn't refuse.Going downtown to deliver the reefers, I felt sensations I cannot describe, in all those differentgrooves at the same time. The only word to describe it was a _timelessness_. A day might haveseemed to me five minutes. Or a half-hour might have seemed a week. 
我在去市中心的路上经过了山姆的店。他那对炯炯有神的西班牙黑人女人打开了门。山姆对那个女人已经上瘾了。他从来没有让他的其他女人像她一样经常在附近晃荡，现在她甚至来应门了。此时山姆已经非常沉迷于毒品。他似乎几乎不认识我了。躺在床上，他伸手到床底下又拿出那个不可避免的刮胡刀镜子，不知出于什么原因，他总是把可卡因水晶放在上面。他示意我闻一下。我没有拒绝。去市中心送卷烟时，我感到无法用言语形容的各种不同的感觉同时涌上心头。唯一能描述它的词是 _永恒_ 。一天可能对我来说就像五分钟。或者半小时可能看起来像一周。
I can't imagine how I looked when I got to the hotel. When the Lesbian and her girl friend saw me,they helped me to a bed; I fell across it and passed out. 
我无法想象我到达酒店时的样子。当女同性恋者和她的女友看到我时，她们帮我到了床上，我横躺在床上，不省人事。
That night, when they woke me up, it was half a day beyond West Indian Archie's deadline. Late, Iwent back uptown. It was on the wire. I could see people who knew me finding businesselsewhere. I knew nobody wanted to be caught in a crossfire. 
那天晚上，当他们叫醒我时，已经过了西印度群岛阿尔奇的截止时间半天了。我迟了，回到市中心。消息已经传开了。我看到认识我的人在其他店里寻找生意。我知道没有人想被卷入一场交火中。
But nothing happened. The next day, either. I just stayed high. 
但是什么都没有发生。第二天还是如此，我只是保持清醒。
Some raw kid hustler in a bar, I had to bust in his mouth. He came back, pulling a blade; I wouldhave shot him, but somebody grabbed him. They put him out, cursing that he was going to killme. 
在酒吧里，我遇到了一个年轻的小混混。他试图用牙齿攻击我，但我还是打了他一顿。他又回来拿刀，我想开枪打他，但有人抓住了他。他们把他扔出去并咒骂我会杀了他。
Intuition told me to get rid of my gun. I gave a hustler the eye across the bar. I'd no more thanslipped him the gun from my belt when a cop I'd seen about came in the other door. He had hishand on his gun butt. He knew what was all over the wire; he was certain I'd be armed. He cameslowly over toward me, and I knew if I sneezed, he'd blast me down. 
我的直觉告诉我要丢掉我的枪。我在酒吧里向一个小混混示意，我从裤子的后口袋里掏出了枪，还没等他反应过来，我就把枪递给了他。这时，我看到门口走进来了一个警察，他的手正放在枪套上。他知道发生了什么事情，他确定我已经准备好了武器。他慢慢地向我走来，我知道如果我打喷嚏，他就会开枪打死我。
He said, "Take your hand out of your pocket, Red-_real_ carefully." 
他说：“把你的手从口袋里拿出来，小心点。”
I did. Once he saw me empty handed, we both could relax a little. He motioned for me to walkoutside, ahead of him, and I did. His partner was waiting on the sidewalk, opposite their patrolcar, double-parked with its radiogoing. With people stopping, looking, they patted me down thereon the sidewalk. 
我照办了。一旦他看到我没有武器，我们都松了一口气。他示意我走到他前面，我就照做了。他的搭档正在人行道上等着，在巡逻车对面，将车停在那里，打开收音机。当人们停下来看着我们时，他们在我身上搜查了一遍。
"What are you looking for?" I asked them when they didn't find anything. 
当他们没有找到任何东西时，我问他们：“你们在找什么？”
"Red, there's a report you're carrying a gun." 
“Red，有一份报告显示你携带着枪支。”
"I had one," I said. "But I threw it in the river." 
“我有一支枪，”我说，“但我把它扔进了河里。”
The one who had come into the bar said, "I think I'd leave town if I were you, Red." 
那个走进酒吧的人说：“我觉得如果你像我一样，最好离开这个城市，Red。”
I went back into the bar. Saying that I had thrown my gun away had kept them from taking me tomy apartment. Things I had there could have gotten me more time than ten guns, and could havegotten them a promotion. 
我回到酒吧里，告诉他们我已经把枪扔掉了，这样他们就不会再把我带到我的公寓去了。我在那里有一些东西比十支枪更有价值，可以让他们得到晋升。
Everything was building up, closing in on me. I was trapped in so many cross turns. West IndianArchie gunning for me. The Italians who thought I'd stuck up their crap game after me. Thescared kid hustler I'd hit. The cops. 
一切都在不断升级，我被困在了太多的危险中。西印度群岛阿尔奇正在追捕我。那些认为我会在他们之后继续玩牌的意大利人。我打的那个害怕的小混混。警察们。
For four years, up to that point, I'd been lucky enough, or slick enough, to escape jail, or evengetting arrested. Or any _serious_ trouble. But I knew that any minute now something had togive. 
在四年的时间里，我一直很幸运或者足够狡猾，能够逃脱监狱的惩罚，甚至没有被逮捕过。或者是任何严重的麻烦。但是我知道现在随时都可能有事情发生。
*     *     * 
Sammy had done something that I've often wished I could have thanked him for. 
山姆做了一件我一直希望能感谢他的事情。
When I heard the car's horn, I was walking on St. Nicholas Avenue. But my ears were hearing agun. I didn't dream the horn could possibly be for me."_Homeboy!_" 
当我听到汽车的喇叭声时，我正在圣尼古拉斯大道上行走。但我的耳朵听到了枪声。我没有想到喇叭声可能是为了我。”_哥们儿！_”
I jerked around; I came close to shooting. 
我猛地转过头来；我差点开枪。
_Shorty_-from Boston! 
_Shorty_ ——来自波士顿！
I'd scared him nearly to death. 
我吓了他几乎要死。
"_Daddy-o!_" 
“_爸爸-哦！_”
I couldn't have been happier. 
我非常高兴。
Inside the car, he told me Sammy had telephoned about how I was jam med up tight and told himhe'd better come and get me. And Shorty did his band's date, then borrowed his piano man's car,and burned up the miles to New York. 
在车里，他告诉我山姆打电话来告诉我我被卡住了，让他最好来救我。然后Shorty参加了他的乐队的演出，借了他的钢琴家的车，一路疾驰到纽约。
I didn't put up any objections to leaving. Shorty stood watch outside my apartment. I brought outand stuffed into the car's trunk what little stuff I cared to hang on to. Then we hit the highway.Shorty had been without sleep for about thirty-six hours. He told me afterward that through justabout the whole ride back, I talked out of my head. 
我没有反对离开，Shorty在我家外面看守。我拿出并塞进了汽车后备箱里我唯一想要带走的东西。然后我们上了高速公路。Shorty已经没有睡觉大约36个小时了。他告诉我，在整个回程中，我都在胡言乱语。
CHAPTER NINE 
第九章
CAUGHT 
抓住
Ella couldn't believe how atheist, how uncouth I had become. I believed that a man should doanything that he was slick enough, or bad and bold enough, to do and that a woman was nothingbut another commodity. Every word I spokewas hip or profane. I would bet that my workingvocabulary wasn't two hundred words. 
艾拉无法相信我曾经是多么的无神论和粗鄙。我认为一个男人应该做任何他足够狡猾或勇敢的事情，而女人只不过是另一个商品。我说的每一句话都是时髦或者亵渎。我敢打赌我的常用词汇不超过两百个单词。
Even Shorty, whose apartment I now again shared, wasn't prepared for how I lived and thought- like a predatory animal. Sometimes I would catch him watching me. 
即使是我再次分享公寓的矮个子也无法适应我的生活方式和思维方式-就像一个捕食动物。有时候我会抓住他看着我。
At first, I slept a lot-even at night.  I had slept mostly in the daytime during the preceding twoyears. When awake, I smoked reefers. Shorty had originally introduced me to marijuana, and myconsumption of it now astounded him. 
起初，我睡了很多觉-甚至在晚上。在过去的两年中，我大部分时间都是在白天睡觉。
I didn't want to talk much, at first. When awake, I'd play records continuously. The reefers gaveme a feeling of contentment. I would enjoy hours of floating, day dreaming, imaginaryconversations with my New York musician friends. 
起初，我不想多说话。清醒时，我会连续播放唱片。
Within two weeks, I'd had more sleep than during any two months when I had been in Harlemhustling day and night. When I finally went out in the Roxbury streets, it took me only a little whileto locate a peddler of "snow"-cocaine. It was when I got back into that familiar snow feeling that Ibegan to want to talk. 
在两周内，我睡了比在哈莱姆日夜奔波的两个月还多的觉。当我最终走到罗克斯伯里街上时，我只花了一点时间就找到了一位“雪”可卡因的小贩。正是当我回到熟悉的“雪”感中时，我开始想说话了。
Cocaine produces, for those who sniff its powdery white crystals, an illusion of supreme well- being, and a soaring over-confidence in both physical and mental ability. You think you could whipthe heavyweight champion, and that you are smarter than anybody. There was also that feeling oftimelessness. And there were intervals of ability to recall and review things that had happenedyears back with an astonishing clarity. 
可卡因对于那些吸食其白色粉末的人来说，会产生一种极度的幸福感和身体和精神能力的过度自信的幻觉。你认为你可以打败重量级冠军，而且你比任何人都聪明。还有一种感觉是永恒的。此外，还有一些能够回忆和回顾几年前发生的事情的能力，清晰度惊人。
Shorty's band played at spots around Boston three or four nights a week. After he left for work,Sophia would come over and I'd talk about my plans. Shewould be gone back to her husband bythe time Shorty returned from work, and I'd bend his ear until daybreak. 
矮个子的乐队每周在波士顿的几个地方演出三到四个晚上。在他上班后，索菲亚会过来和我谈论我的计划。当矮个子下班回家时，她会回到她的丈夫身边，而我则会一直缠着他，直到天亮。
Sophia's husband had gotten out of the military, and he was some sort of salesman. He wassupposed to have a big deal going which soon would require his traveling a lot to the West Coast.I didn't ask questions, but Sophia often indicated they weren't doing too well. I know _I_ hadnothing to do with that. He never dreamed I existed. A white woman might blow up at herhusband and scream and yell and call him every name she can think of, and say the most viciousthings in an effort to hurt him, and talk about his mother and his grandmother, too, but one thingshe never will tell him herself is that she is going with a black man. That's one automatic redmurder flag to the white man, and his woman knows it. 
索菲亚的丈夫已经离开了军队，他是一名推销员。据说他即将获得一笔大生意，需要经常往返于西海岸。我并没有问什么，但索菲亚经常表示他们的生意并不好。我知道我没有参与其中。他从没有想过我的存在。一位白人女性可能会对她的丈夫大喊大叫，咒骂他，用尽她能想到的所有词语来伤害他，还会谈论他的妈妈和祖母，但她永远不会告诉他的是她正和一个黑人在一起。这对白人男性来说是一个自动的红旗，而他的妻子知道这一点。
Sophia always had given me money. Even when I had hundreds of dollars in my pocket, whenshe came to Harlem I would take everything she had short of her train fare back to Boston. Itseems that some women love to be exploited. When they are not exploited, they exploit the man.Anyway, it was his money that she gave me, I guess, because she never had worked. But nowmy demands on her increased, and she came up with more; again, I don't know where she got it.Always, every now and then, I had given her a hard time, just to keep her in line. Every once in awhile a woman seems to need, in fact _wants_ this, too. But now, I would feel evil and slap heraround worse than ever, some of the nights when Shorty was away. She would cry, curse me,and swear that she would never be back. But I knew she wasn't even thinking about not comingback. 
索菲亚总是给我钱。即使我口袋里有数百美元，当她来到哈莱姆时，我会拿走她身上除了火车票以外的所有东西，让她回到波士顿。似乎有些女人喜欢被剥削。当她们没有被剥削时，她们就会剥削男人。无论如何，我想这是她给我的钱，因为她从来没有工作过。但是现在我对她的索取越来越多，而她也越来越多地满足我；再一次，我不知道她从哪里得到了这些钱。我总是时不时地给她制造麻烦，只是为了让她守规矩。每隔一段时间，一个女人似乎需要，事实上想要这个。但是现在，每当矮个子不在的时候，我会比以前更加恶劣地对待她，甚至会打她。她会哭，咒骂我，并发誓永远不会再回来。但我知道她甚至没有想过不回来。
Sophia's being around was one of Shorty's greatest pleasures about my homecoming. I have saidit before, I never in my life have seen a black man that desired white women as sincerely asShorty did. Since I had known him, he had had several. He had never been able to keep a whitewoman any length oftime, though, because he was too good to them, and, as I have said, anywoman, white or black, seems to get bored with that. 
索菲亚的存在是矮个子回家后最高兴的事情之一。我以前说过，我这辈子从未见过一个黑人像矮个子那样真诚地渴望白人女性。自从认识他以来，他已经有过几个了。然而，他从未能够长时间保持一个白人女性，因为他对她们太好了，而且，正如我所说，任何女人，无论是白人还是黑人，似乎都对此感到厌倦。
It happened that Shorty was between white women when one night Sophia brought to the househer seventeen-year-old sister. I never saw anything like the way that she and Shorty nearlyjum ped for each other. For him, she wasn't only a white girl, but a _young_ white girl. For her, hewasn't only a Negro, but a Negro _musician_. In looks, she was a younger version of Sophia, whostill turned heads. Sometimes I'd take the two girls to Negro places where Shorty played. Negroesshowed thirty-two teeth apiece as soon as they saw the white girls. They would come over to yourbooth, or your table; they would stand there and drool. And Shorty was no better. He'd stand upthere playing and watching that young girl waiting for him, and waving at him, and winking. Assoon as the set was over, he'd practically run over people getting down to our table. 
有一天，矮个子正在和一位白人女性在一起时，索菲亚把她17岁的妹妹带到了家里。我从未见过他们之间如此热烈地相互吸引。对于矮个子来说，她不仅仅是一位白人女孩，还是一位年轻的白人女孩。而对于她来说，他不仅仅是一位黑人，还是一位黑人音乐家。从外表上看，她是索菲亚的年轻版本，依然引人注目。有时我会带着两个女孩去矮个子演奏的黑人场所。每当黑人看到白人女孩时，他们会露出32颗牙齿。他们会走到你的座位或桌子旁边，站在那儿流口水。矮个子也好不到哪里去。他会站起来演奏，看着那个年轻女孩等着他，向他挥手，眨眼睛。一旦演出结束，他会几乎跑到我们的桌子前。
I didn't lindy-hop any more now, I wouldn't even have thought of it now, just as I wouldn't havebeen caught in a zoot suit now. All of my suits were conservative. A banker might have worn myshoes. 
我现在不再跳林迪舞了，我甚至不会想到它，就像我不会穿现在那种西装一样。我所有的套装都是保守的。银行家可能会穿我的鞋子。
I met Laura again. We were really glad to see each other. She was a lot more like me now, agood-time girl. We talked and laughed. She looked a lot older than she really was. She had noone man, she free-lanced around. She had long since moved away from her grandmother. Lauratold me she had finished school, but then she gave up the college idea. Laura was high wheneverI saw her, now, too; we smoked some reefers together. 
我再次遇到了劳拉。我们非常高兴地见到了彼此。她现在很像我，一个喜欢玩乐的女孩。我们聊天、嬉笑。她看起来比她实际年龄老得多。她没有男人，自由地四处奔波。她早已搬离了她的祖母家。劳拉告诉我她已经完成了学业，但是后来放弃了上大学的想法。
*     *     * 
***（三个星号）***
After about a month of "laying dead," as inactivity was called, I knew I had to get some kind ofhustle going.A hustler, broke, needs a stake. Some nights when Shorty was playing, I would take whateverSophia had been able to get for me, and I'd try to run it up into something, playing stud poker atJohn Hughes' gambling house. 
在大约一个月的“躺着不动”之后，因为这种不活跃的状态被称为“躺着不动”，我知道我必须开始做些事情了。一个流浪汉，破产了，需要一些赌注。有些晚上当矮个子在演奏时，我会拿索菲亚设法为我得到的东西，然后我会试着把它升级成一些东西，比如在约翰·休斯的赌场玩扑克。
When I had lived in Roxbury before, John Hughes had been a big gambler who wouldn't havespoken to me. But during the war the Roxbury "wire" had carried a lot about things I was doing inHarlem, and now the New York name magic was on me. That was the feeling that hustlerseverywhere else had: if you could hustle and make it in New York, they were well off to know you;it gave them prestige. Anyway, through the same flush war years, John Hughes had hustledprofitably enough to be able to open a pretty good gambling house. 
当我在罗克斯伯里住过之前，约翰·休斯是一个喜欢赌博的人，他可能不会和我说话。但是在战争期间，罗克斯伯里的“线人”已经报道了许多关于我在哈莱姆做的事情，现在纽约的名流们开始关注我了。这是其他各地的骗子都有的感觉：如果你能在纽约骗到钱并成功立足，他们会很高兴认识你；这给他们带来了声望。无论如何，通过同样的繁荣的战争年代，约翰·休斯已经足够成功地骗到了足够的钱来开一家相当不错的赌场。
John, one night, was playing in a game I was in. After the first two cards were dealt around thetable, I had an ace showing. I looked beneath it at my hole card; another ace-a pair, back-to-back. 
有一天晚上，约翰在我的赌局中玩牌。在桌子周围的前两张牌被发出来之后，我手中出现了一张A。我看了一下自己的底牌，另一张A——一对，背靠背。
My ace showing made it my turn to bet. 
我的A牌出现，轮到我下注了。
But I didn't rush. I sat there and studied. 
但是我并没有匆忙地下注，而是坐在那里仔细研究。
Finally, I knocked my knuckles on the table, passing, leaving the betting to the next man. Myaction implied that beneath my ace was some "nothing" card that I didn't care to risk my moneyon. 
最后，我敲了敲桌子，放弃了下注，把机会留给了下一个人。我的行动意味着我的A牌下面可能是一些“无牌”的牌，我不想用钱去冒险。
The player sitting next to me took the bait. He bet pretty heavily. And the next man raised him.Possibly each of them had small pairs. Maybe they just wanted to scare me out before I drewanother ace. Finally, the bet reached John, who had a queen showing; he raised everybody. 
坐在我旁边的玩家上钩了。他下了很大的赌注。下一个玩家加注了。可能他们每个人都有小对子。也许他们只是想在我抽出另一张A之前吓跑我。最后，赌注传到了一个手中拿着一张皇后牌的约翰；他向每个人加注。
Now, there was no telling what John had. John truly was a clever gambler. Hecould gamble aswell as anybody I had gambled with in New York. 
现在，无法确定约翰手上的牌是什么。约翰确实是一个聪明的赌徒。他可以和我在纽约与之赌博的任何人一样出色地下注。
So the bet came back to me. It was going to cost me a lot of money to call all the raises. Some ofthem obviously had good cards but I knew I had every one of them beat. But again I studied, andstudied; I pretended perplexity. And finally I put in my money, calling the bets. 
所以赌注又回到了我这里。要叫住所有的加注需要花费我很多钱。其中一些人显然有好牌，但我知道我可以打败他们的每张牌。但是我再次仔细研究了牌局，装作很困惑。最终我下了注，叫住了所有人的加注。
The same betting pattern went on, with each new card, right around to the last card. And whenthat last card went around, I hit another ace in sight. Three aces. And John hit another queen insight. 
同样的下注模式一直持续到最后一局，每当发完一张新牌，我就下注。最后一张牌出现时，我又看到了另一张A。三张A。约翰又出现了另一张皇后。
He bet a pile. Now, everyone else studied a long time-and, one by one, all folded their hands.Except me. All I could do was put what I had left on the table. 
他下了一大笔赌注。现在，每个人都研究了很久——然后，一个个地，所有人都把手放在桌子上。除了我。我能做的只是把我剩下的钱放在桌子上。
If I'd had the money, I could have raised five hundred dollars or more, and he'd have had to callme. John couldn't have gone the rest of his life wondering if I had bluffed him out of a pot that big. 
如果我有足够的钱，我可以下注500美元或更多，他会被迫叫牌。约翰不可能一辈子都在想我是不是在用大赌注骗他出局。
I showed my hole card ace; John had three queens. As I hauled in the pot, something over fivehundred dollars-my first real stake in Boston-John got up from the table. He'd quit. He told hishouse man, "Anytime Red comes in here and wants anything, let him have it." He said, "I'venever seen a young man play his hole card like he played." 
我展示了我的底牌——A，而约翰手上有3张皇后牌。当我把赌注收起来时，已经超过了500美元——这是我在波士顿的第一笔真正的赌注——约翰从桌子上站起来离开了。他退出了赌局
John said "young man," being himself about fifty, I guess, although you can never be certainabout a Negro's age. He thought, as most people would have, that I was about thirty. No one inRoxbury except my sisters Ella and Mary suspected my real age. 
约翰说“年轻人 ” ， 虽然他大概已经50多岁了，但你永远无法确定一个黑人的年龄。他像大多数人一样认为我大约30岁。除了我姐妹埃拉和玛丽之外，罗克斯伯里没有其他人怀疑我的实际年龄。
The story of that poker game helped my on-scene reputation among the othergamblers andhustlers around Roxbury. Another thing that happened in John's gambling house contributed: theincident that made it known that I carried not a gun, but some guns. 
那次扑克牌游戏的故事帮助我在罗克斯伯里其他赌徒和骗子中建立了良好的声誉。在约翰的赌场发生的另一件事情也有贡献：这个事件让人们知道了我携带的不是枪支，而是一些枪支。
John had a standing rule that anyone who came into the place to gamble had to check his guns ifhe had any. I always checked two guns. Then, one night, when a gambler tried to pull somethingslick, I drew a third gun, from its shoulder holster. This added to the rest of my reputation the wordthat I was "trigger-happy" and "crazy." 
约翰有一个规定，任何来到这个地方赌博的人都必须检查他是否携带枪支。我总是检查两把枪。然后有一天晚上，当一个赌徒试图作弊时，我从他的肩挂式枪套里掏出了第三把枪。这增加了我的“扣动扳机成瘾”和“疯狂”的名声。
Looking back, I think I really was at least slightly out of my mind. I viewed narcotics as mostpeople regard food. I wore my guns as today I wear my neckties. Deep down, I actually believedthat after living as fully as humanly possible, one should then die violently. I expected then, as Istill expect today, to die at any time. But then, I think I deliberately invited death in many,sometimes insane, ways. 
回想起来，我认为我当时确实有点疯狂。我把毒品看作大多数人把食物当作一回事。我把枪支挂在身上就像今天系领带一样。内心深处，我实际上相信在尽可能充分地生活之后，一个人应该以暴力的方式死去。我当时期望像现在一样随时可能死去。但是，我认为我故意以许多有时是疯狂的方式邀请死亡。
For instance, a merchant marine sailor who knew me and my reputation came into a bar carryinga package. He motioned me to follow him downstairs into the men's room. He unwrapped astolen machine gun; he wanted to sell it. I said, "How do I know it works?" He loaded it with acartridge clip, and told me that all I would have to do then was squeeze the trigger release. I tookthe gun, examined it, and the first thing he knew I had it jammed right up in his belly. I told him Iwould blow him wide open. He went backwards out of the rest room and up the stairs the way Bill"Bojangles" Robinson used to dance going backwards. He knew I was crazy enough to kill him. Iwas insane enough not to consider that he might just wait his c hance to kill me. For perhaps amonth I kept the machine gun at Shorty's before I was broke and sold it. 
例如，一位认识我和我声誉的商船水手走进一家酒吧，拿着一个包裹。他示意我跟着他下楼到男厕所。他打开一个偷来的机关枪，想要卖掉它。我说：“我怎么知道它能用？”他把一颗子弹装上弹夹，告诉我只要扣下扳机就行了。我拿过这把枪，检查了一下，他还没反应过来，我就把它塞进他的肚子里。我告诉他我要把他打成筛子。他向后跳出了厕所，像比尔·“博加兹”·罗宾逊跳舞那样向后跳着上了楼梯。他知道我足够疯狂会杀了他。而我则足够疯狂，不会考虑他会等待机会杀我的可能性。大约一个月后，我把机关枪留在了肖蒂那里，直到我用光了钱才把它卖了。
When Reginald came to Roxbury visiting, he was shocked at what he'd found out upon returningto Harlem. I spent some time with him. He still was the kidbrother whom I still felt more "family"toward than I felt now even for our sister Ella. Ella still liked me. I would go to see her once in awhile. But Ella had never been able to reconcile herself to the way I had changed. She has sincetold me that she had a steady foreboding that I was on my way into big trouble. But I always hadthe feeling that Ella somehow admired my rebellion against the world, because she, who had somuch more drive and guts than most men, often felt stymied by having been born female. 
当雷金纳德来罗克斯伯里拜访时，他发现回到哈莱姆后的情况很震惊。我和他一起度过了一段时间。他仍然是我的弟弟，即使现在我也仍然更像家人一样对待他，甚至比对待我们的妹妹埃拉还要亲密。埃拉仍然喜欢我。我会时不时地去看望她。但埃拉一直无法接受我的变化。她曾经告诉我，她有一种不祥的预感，认为我正在走向大麻烦。但我总觉得埃拉在某种程度上是欣赏我反抗世界的，因为她比大多数男人更有冲劲和勇气，但她常常感到自己作为女性出生而受到阻碍。
Had I been thinking only in terms of myself, maybe I would have chosen steady gambling as ahustle. There were enough chump gamblers that hung around John Hughes' for a good gamblerto make a living off them; chumps that worked, usually. One would just have to never miss thegames on their paydays. Besides, John Hughes had offered me a job dealing for games; I didn'twant that. 
如果我只考虑自己，也许我会选择稳定的赌博作为副业。有足够多的傻瓜赌徒在约翰·休斯的赌场周围晃悠，对于一个优秀的赌徒来说，他们足以维持生计；通常是那些工作的人。人们只需要确保在发薪日不缺席比赛就行了。此外，约翰·休斯还提供了一个赌博交易的工作机会，但我不想要那个。
But I had come around to thinking not only of myself. I wanted to get something going that couldhelp Shorty, too. We had been talking; I really felt sorry for Shorty. The same old musician story.The so-called glamor of being a musician, earning just about enough money so that after he paidrent and bought his reefers and food and other routine things, he had nothing left. Plus debts.How could Shorty have anything? I'd spent years in Harlem and on the road around the mostpopular musicians, the "names," even, who really were making big money for musicians-and theyhad nothing. 
但我开始考虑自己之外的人。我想做些事情来帮助肖蒂。我们谈过了，我真的为肖蒂感到难过。还是那个老音乐人的故事。所谓的音乐家的光彩，赚的钱刚刚够支付租金、购买烟草、食物和其他日常用品，剩下的钱就所剩无几了，还要还债。肖蒂怎么能有什么？我在哈莱姆和周围最受欢迎的音乐家们待了几年，甚至是那些真正为音乐家赚大钱的“名字”，他们却一无所有。
For that matter, all the thousands of dollars I'd handled, and _I_ had nothing. Just satisfying mycocaine habit alone cost me about twenty dollars a day. I guess another five dollars a day couldhave been added for reefers and plain tobacco cigarettes that I smoked; besides getting high ondrugs, I chain-smoked as many as four packs a day. And, if you ask me today, I'll tell you thattobacco, in all its forms, is just as much an addiction as any narcotic. 
就这个问题而言，我处理过的成千上万美元，而我什么都没有。光是满足我的可卡因成瘾就花了我每天大约20美元。我想还可以再为香烟和普通烟草卷烟每天增加5美元的开销；除了在药物的影响下，我还每天连续抽四包香烟。如果你今天问我，我会告诉你，烟草及其所有形式都像任何麻醉剂一样是一种成瘾。
 When I opened the subject of a hustle with Shorty, I started by first bringing him to agree with myconcept-of which he was a living proof-that only squares kept on believing they could ever getanything by slaving. 
当我向肖蒂提出进行赌博的建议时，我首先让他同意我的概念——他就是一个活生生的例子——只有平方数的人才会一直相信他们可以通过奴役来获得任何东西。
And when I mentioned what I had in mind-house burglary Shorty, who always had been sorelatively conservative, really surprised me by how quickly he agreed. He didn't even knowanything about burglarizing. 
当我提到我的计划时——入室盗窃，肖蒂这个一直相对保守的人真的让我很惊讶，他竟然如此迅速地同意了。他甚至对入室盗窃一无所知。
When I began to explain how it was done, Shorty wanted to bring in this friend of his, whom I hadmet, and liked, called Rudy. 
当我开始解释如何进行时，肖蒂想介绍他的朋友给我认识，那个叫鲁迪的人。我之前见过他，也很喜欢和他在一起。
Rudy's mother was Italian, his father was a Negro. He was born right there in Boston, a short,light fellow, a pretty boy type. Rudy worked regularly for an employment agency that sent him towait on tables at exclusive parties. He had a side deal going, a hustle that took me right back tothe old steering days in Harlem. Once a week, Rudy went to the home of this old, rich Bostonblueblood, pillar-of-society aristocrat. He paid Rudy to undress them both, then pick up the oldman like a baby, lay him on his bed, then stand over him and sprinkle him all over with _talcumpowder_, Rudy said the old man would actually reach his climax from that. 
鲁迪的母亲是意大利人，父亲是黑人。他出生在波士顿，是一个身材矮小、面容姣好的男孩。鲁迪定期为一家职业介绍所工作，被派去参加高档派对的招待工作。他有一项副业，就是和我回到哈莱姆以前的操纵生活。每周一次，鲁迪会去这位年迈富有的波士顿贵族家中。他付钱让鲁迪脱掉他们两个人的衣服，然后像抱婴儿一样抱起老人，把他放在他的床上，然后站在他身边，用粉末撒满全身，鲁迪说这个老人实际上会从中得到高潮。
I told him and Shorty about some of the things I'd seen. Rudy said that as far as he knew, Bostonhad no organized specialty sex houses, just i ndividual rich whites who had their private specialtydesires catered to by Negroes who came to their homes camouflaged as chauffeurs, maids,waiters, or some other accepted image. Just as in New York, these were the rich, the highestsociety-the predominantly old men, past the age of ability to conduct any kind of ordinary sex,always hunting for new ways to be "sensitive." 
我告诉他们我和肖蒂的一些经历。
Rudy, I remember, spoke of one old white man who paid a black couple to let him watch themhave intercourse on his bed. Another was so "sensitive" thathe paid to sit on a chair outside aroom where a couple was-he got his satisfaction just from imagining what was going on inside. 
我记得鲁迪曾经讲过一个老白人，他付钱给一对黑人夫妇
A good burglary team includes, I knew, what is called a "finder." A finder is one who locateslucrative places to rob. Another principal need is someone able to "case" these places' physicallayouts-to determine means of entry, the best getaway routes, and so forth. Rudy qualified onboth counts. Being sent to work in rich homes, he wouldn't be suspected when he sized up theirloot and cased the joint, just running around looking busy with a white coat on. 
我知道一个出色的盗窃团队需要包括所谓的“发现者”。发现者是能够找到有利可图的地点进行抢劫的人。另一个主要需要的是有人能够“调查”这些地方的物理布局-确定入口的方式，最好的逃跑路线等等。鲁迪在这两个方面都很合格。他被派往富人家中工作，当他评估他们的赃物并调查这个地方时，他不会被怀疑，只会穿着白大褂四处忙碌。
Rudy's reaction, when he was told what we had in mind, was something, I remember, like "Man,when do we start?" 
我记得当鲁迪得知我们的想法时，他的反应是：“天啊，我们什么时候开始？”
But I wasn't rushing off half-cocked. I had learned from some of the pros, and from my ownexperience, how important it was to be careful and plan. Burglary, properly executed, though ithad its dangers, offered the maximum chances of success with the minimum risk. If you did yourjob so that you never met any of your victims, it first lessened your chances of having to attack orperhaps kill someone. And if through some slip-up you were caught, later, by the police, therewas never a positive eyewitness.It is also important to select an area of burglary and stick to that. There are specific specialtiesamong burglars. Some work apartments only, others houses only, others stores only, orwarehouses; still others will go after only safes or strongboxes. 
但是我并不是匆忙行事。我从一些专业人士那里学到了如何小心谨慎地计划，因为我知道，如果正确执行的话，入室盗窃虽然有风险，但是成功率最高，风险最小。如果你的工作让你从未遇到你的受害者，那么你就减少了袭击或甚至杀害某人的机会。而且如果由于某些失误被警方抓住，也永远不会有目击证人。选择入室盗窃的区域并坚持这个区域也很重要。在入室盗窃者中有一些特定的专业领域。有些人只攻击公寓，有些人只攻击房屋，有些人只攻击商店或仓库，还有些人只会攻击保险箱或保险柜。
Within the residence burglary category, there are further specialty distinctions. There are the dayburglars, the dinner-and theater-time burglars, the night burglars. I think that any city's police willtell you that very rarely do they find one type who will work at another time. For instanceJumpsteady, in Harlem, was a nighttime apartment specialist. It would have been hard topersuadeJumpsteady to work in the daytime if a millionaire had gone out for lunch and left hisfront door wide open. 
在住宅入室盗窃类别中，还有进一步的专门区别。有白天入室盗窃者、晚餐和戏剧时间入室盗窃者和夜间入室盗窃者。我认为任何城市的警察都会告诉你，他们很少发现一种类型的人会在另一个时间段工作。例如，在哈莱姆区，Jumpsteady是一个夜间公寓专家。如果一个百万富翁出去吃午餐并留下前门敞开，那么要说服Jumpsteady在白天工作就很难了。
I had one very practical reason never to work in the daytime, aside from my inclinations. With myhigh visibility, I'd have been sunk in the daytime. I could just hear people: "A reddish-brown Negroover six feet tall." One glance would be enough. 
除了我的倾向外，我还有一个非常实际的理由从不在白天工作。由于我的高曝光度，我在白天很容易被发现。我可以听到人们说：“一个身高超过六英尺、红褐色皮肤的黑人”。只需要一眼就足够被发现了。
*     *     * 
Setting up what I wanted to be the perfect operation, I thought about pulling the white girls into itfor two reasons. One was that I realized we'd be too limited relying only upon places where Rudyworked as a waiter. He didn't get to work in too many places; it wouldn't be very long before weran out of sources. And when other places had to be found and cased in the rich, white residentialareas, Negroes hanging around would stick out like sore thumbs, but these white girls could getinvited into the right places. 
为了建立我想要的完美行动，我想到了拉白人女孩加入其中。有两个原因。一个是我意识到，我们只依靠鲁迪工作过的餐厅作为资源是太过局限了。他不能在太多地方工作；不久之后我们就用完了资源。而当我们需要找到其他富有的白人居住区进行入室盗窃，黑人的出现会非常惹眼，但是这些白人女孩可以受邀进入正确的地点。
I disliked the idea of having too many people involved, all at the same time. But with Shorty andSophia's sister so close now, and Sophia and me as though we had been together for fifty years,and Rudy as eager and cool as he was, nobody would be apt to spill, everybody would be underthe same risk; we would be like a family unit. 
我不喜欢太多人同时参与的想法。但是随着Shorty和Sophia的妹妹现在变得如此亲密，Sophia和我好像已经在一起50年了，而Rudy又如此渴望和冷静，没有人会冒险泄露出去，每个人都会承担同样的风险；我们会像一家人一样团结一致。
I never doubted that Sophia would go along. Sophia would do anything I said. And her sisterwould do anything that Sophia said. They both went for it. Sophia's husband was away on one ofhis trips to the coast when I told her and her sister. 
我从不怀疑Sophia会跟着做。 Sophia会做我说的所有事情。她的妹妹也会做Sophia说的所有事情。她们两个都愿意参与。当我告诉Sophia和她妹妹时，她丈夫正在一次去海岸的旅行中。
Most burglars, I knew, were caught not on the job, but trying to dispose of the loot. Finding thefence we used was a rare piece of luck. We agreed upon theplan for operations. The fence didn'twork with us directly. He had a representative, an ex-con, who dealt with me, and no one else inmy gang. Aside from his regular business, he owned around Boston several garages and smallwarehouses. The arrangement was that before a job, I would alert the representative, and givehim a general idea of what we expected to get, and he'd tell me at which garage or warehouse weshould make the drop. After we had made our drop, the representative would examine the stolenarticles. He would remove all identifying marks from everything. Then he would call the fence,who would come and make a personal appraisal. The next day the representative would meet meat a prearranged place and would make the payment for what we had stolen-in cash. 
据我所知，大多数窃贼不是在执行任务时被抓的，而是在试图处理赃物时被抓的。找到我们使用的栅栏是一件难得的幸运事。我们就行动计划达成了一致。栅栏对我们不起直接作用。他有一个代表，一个有前科的人，和我打交道，我的帮派里没有其他人。除了日常生意外，他还在波士顿附近拥有几个车库和小仓库。当时的安排是，在开始一项工作之前，我会提醒销售代表，让他大致了解我们希望得到什么，然后他会告诉我我们应该在哪个车库或仓库交货。我们送完货后，代表将检查被偷的物品。他会从所有东西上去除所有的识别标记。然后他会打电话给篱笆，篱笆会来做个人评估。第二天，这位代表将在事先安排好的地方与梅特见面，并用现金支付我们偷来的东西。
One thing I remember. This fence always sent your money in crisp, brand-new bills. He wassmart. Somehow that had a very definite psychological effect upon all of us, after we had pulled ajob , walking around with that crisp green money in our pockets. He may have had other reasons. 
我记得一件事。这个围栏总是用崭新的百元钞票付款。他很聪明。不知怎的，在我们成功抢劫后，手里揣着这些崭新的百元钞票，这对我们的心理产生了很大的影响。他可能还有其他原因。
We needed a base of operations-not in Roxbury. The girls rented an apartment in HarvardSquare. Unlike Negroes, these white girls could go shopping for the locale and physical situationwe wanted. It was on the ground floor, where, moving late at night, all of us could come and gowithout attracting notice. 
我们需要一个操作基地，不在罗克斯伯里。女孩们在哈佛广场租了一间公寓。与黑人不同，这些白人女孩可以购物选择我们想要的地点和物理环境。它位于底层，晚上很晚才移动，我们所有人都可以进出而不引起注意。
*     *     * 
In any organization, someone must be the boss. If it's even just one person, you've got to be theboss of yourself. 
在任何一个组织中，必须有一个领导者。即使只有一个人，你也必须成为自己的领袖。
At our gang's first meeting in the apartment, we discussed how we were going to work. The girlswould get into houses to case them by ringing bells and saying they were saleswomen, poll- takers, college girls making a survey, or anything else suitable. Once in the houses, they wouldget around as much as theycould without attracting attention. Then, back, they would report whatspecial valuables they had seen, and where. They would draw the layout for Shorty, Rudy, andme. We agreed that the girls would actually burglarize only in special cases where there would besome advantage. But generally the three men would go, two of us to do the job while the thirdkept watch in the getaway car, with the motor running. 
在我们团伙在公寓里第一次聚会时，我们讨论了如何进行工作。女孩们会按门铃并自称销售员、选民、大学生做调查或其他任何合适的身份进入房屋进行侦查。一旦进入房屋，她们会尽可能地走动而不引起注意。然后回到集合地点，她们会报告她们看到的特殊贵重物品以及它们所在的位置。她们会为Shorty、Rudy和我绘制布局图。我们一致认为只有在有优势的情况下才会让女孩们实际进行盗窃，但通常情况下，三个男人会去，其中两个完成任务，而第三个人在逃跑车辆中保持警戒，同时开着引擎。
Talking to them, laying down the plans, I had deliberately sat on a bed away from them. All of asudden, I pulled out my gun, shook out all five bullets, and then let them see me put back onlyone bullet. I twirled the cylinder, and put the muzzle to my head. "Now, I'm going to see how muchguts all of you have," I said. 
和他们交谈，制定计划时，我特意坐在远离他们的床上。突然，我拔出我的枪，摇出五颗子弹，然后让他们看到我只放回一颗子弹。我旋转弹夹，把枪口对准了我的头。“现在，我要看看你们所有人有多少胆量。”我说。
I grinned at them. All of their mouths had flapped open. I pulled the trigger-we all heard it _click_."I'm going to do it again, now." 
我对他们微笑着。他们都张大了嘴巴。我扣动了扳机——我们都听到了咔嚓声。”“我要再试一次，现在。”
They begged me to stop. I could see in Shorty's and Rudy's eyes some idea of rushing me. 
他们求我停止。我从Shorty和Rudy的眼神中看到了一些想要制服我的想法。
We all heard the hammer _click_ on another empty cylinder. The women were in hysterics. Rudyand Shorty were begging, _"Man. . . Red. . . cut it out, man!. . . Freeze!"_ I pulled the trigger oncemore. 
我们都听到了枪机扣动的声音，说明弹夹已经空了。女人们开始歇斯底里起来。Rudy和Shorty恳求着：“哥们儿……红……别这样，哥们儿！……住手！”我又扣动了扳机。
"I'm doing this, showing you I'm not afraid to die," I told them. "Never cross a man not afraid todie. . . now, let's get to work!" 
“我要这样做，向你们展示我不怕死，”我告诉他们。 “永远不要惹一个不怕死的人……现在，让我们开始工作吧！”
I never had one moment's trouble with any of them after that. Sophia acted awed, her sister allbut called me "Mr. Red." Shorty and Rudy were never again quite the same with me. Neither ofthem ever mentioned it. They thought I was crazy. They were afraid of me. 
在那之后，我从未与他们中的任何一个人有过任何麻烦。 Sophia表现得敬畏，她的妹妹几乎叫我“红先生”。 Shorty和Rudy再也没有与我完全相同了。他们两个都没有提及过这一点。他们认为我是疯了。他们害怕我。
 We pulled the first job that night-the place of the old man who hired Rudy to sprinkle him withtalcum powder. A cleaner job couldn't have been asked for. Everything went like clockwork. Thefence was full of praise; he proved he meant it with his crisp, new money. The old man later toldRudy how a small army of detectives had been there-and they decided that the job had theearmarks of some gang which had been operating around Boston for about a year. 
那天晚上我们完成了第一次任务——那位雇用Rudy给他撒滑石粉的老人的住所。这是一份再简单不过的工作了。一切都像钟表一样运转。那个围栏对我们的表现赞不绝口，他用崭新的百元钞票证明了他的承诺。后来老人告诉Rudy，有一支小型警力在那里，他们认为这个案件有一些波士顿周围运作了大约一年的犯罪团伙的痕迹。
We quickly got it down to a science. The girls would scout and case in wealthy neighborhoods.The burglary would be pulled; sometimes it took no more than ten minutes. Shorty and I did mostof the actual burglary. Rudy generally had the getaway car. 
我们很快就把它变成了一门科学。女孩们在富裕的社区里进行侦查和侦查，然后进行盗窃。盗窃会被拆除，有时只需要不到十分钟。 Shorty和我完成了大部分实际的盗窃工作。 Rudy通常驾驶逃跑车辆。
If the people weren't at home, we'd use a passkey on a common door lock. On a patent lock, we'duse a jimmy, as it's called, or a lockpick. Or, sometimes, we would enter by windows from a fire- escape, or a roof. Gullible women often took the girls all over their houses, just to hear themexclaiming over the finery. With the help of the girls' drawings and a finger-beam searchlight, wewent straight to the things we wanted. 
如果人们不在家，我们会使用普通门锁的钥匙。对于专利锁，我们会使用一种叫做“钥匙坯”或开锁器的工具。有时，我们也会从防火梯或屋顶的窗户进入。容易受骗的女人经常带着女孩们到处逛她们的房子，只是为了听到她们对这些华丽的衣服惊叹不已。在女孩们的绘图和手指光束探照灯的帮助下，我们直奔我们想要的东西。
Sometimes the victims were in their beds asleep. That may sound very daring. Actually, it wasalmost easy. The first thing we had to do when people were in the house was to wait, very still,and pick up the sounds of breathing. Snorers we loved; they made it real easy. In stockinged feet,we'd go right into the bedrooms. Moving swiftly, like shadows, we would lift clothes, watches,wallets, handbags, and jewelry boxes. 
有时受害者正在床上睡觉。这听起来可能很大胆。实际上，这几乎很容易。当人们在家里时，我们必须做的第一件事就是等待，非常安静，然后听到呼吸声。打鼾的人是我们喜欢的，他们让事情变得非常容易。穿着厚底鞋，我们会直接进入卧室。像影子一样快速移动，我们会拿起衣服、手表、钱包、手提包和珠宝盒。
The Christmas season was Santa Claus for us; people had expensive presents lying all over theirhouses. And they had taken more cash than usual out of their banks. Sometimes, working earlierthan we usually did, we even worked houses that we hadn't cased. If the shades were drawn full,and no lights wereon, and there was no answer when one of the girls rang the bell, we would takethe chance and go in. 
圣诞节对我们来说就是圣诞老人；人们把他们昂贵的礼物散落在房子里。而且他们比平时从银行取出更多的现金。有时候，我们会比平常更早地开始工作，甚至会去那些我们还没有做过案子的家。如果窗帘拉得紧紧的，没有灯光亮着，当一个女孩按门铃时也没有人回答，我们就会选择冒险进屋。
I can give you a very good tip if you want to keep burglars out of your house. A light on for theburglar to see is the very best single means of protection. One of the ideal things is to leave abathroom light on all night. The bathroom is one place where somebody could be, for any lengthof time, at any time of the night, and he would be likely to hear the slightest strange sound. Theburglar, knowing this, won't try to enter. 'It's also the cheapest possible protection. The kilowattsare a lot cheaper than your valuables. 
如果你想让你的房子不受入侵者侵扰，我可以给你一个非常好的建议。给入侵者一个可以看见的灯光是最好的保护方式之一。其中一个理想的方法是让浴室灯整夜开着。浴室是一个可以在任何时候呆上很长时间的地方，而且他很可能会听到最微弱的奇怪声音。入侵者知道这一点，就不会试图进入。这也是最便宜的保护方式。千瓦数比贵重物品便宜得多。
We became efficient. The fence sometimes relayed tips as to where we could find good loot. Itwas in this way that for one period, one of our best periods, I remember, we specialized inOriental rugs. I have always suspected that the fence himself sold the rugs to the people we stolethem from. But, anyway, you wouldn't imagine the value of those things. I remember one smallone that brought us a thousand dollars. There's no telling what the fence got for it. Every burglarknew that fences robbed the burglars worse than the burglars had robbed the victims. 
我们变得效率很高。有时，栅栏会传递提示，告诉我们哪里可以找到好的战利品。就这样，我记得有一段时间是我们最好的时期之一，我们专门偷东方地毯。我一直怀疑那个栅栏自己把地毯卖给了我们从中偷窃的人。但是，不管怎样，你不会想象到这些东西的价值。我记得有一块小地毯给我们带来了一千美元。没人知道那个栅栏从中得到什么。每个盗贼都知道，栅栏比盗贼从受害者那里偷走的东西更糟糕。
Our only close brush with the law came once when we were making our getaway, three of us inthe front seat of the car, and the back seat loaded with stuff. Suddenly we saw a police car roundthe corner, coming toward us, and it went on past us. They were just cruising. B ut then in therear-view mirror, we saw them make a U-turn, and we knew they were going to flash us to stop.They had spotted us, in passing, as Negroes, and they knew that Negroes had no business in thearea at that hour. It was a close situation. There was a lot of robbery going on; we weren't theonly gang working, we knew, not by any means. But I knew that the white man is rare who willever consider that a Negro can outsmart him. Before their light began flashing, I told Rudy tostop. I did what I'd done once before-got out and flagged them, walking toward them. Whentheystopped, I was at their car. I asked them, bumbling my words like a confused Negro, if they couldtell me how to get to a Roxbury address. They told me, and we, and they, went on about ourrespective businesses. 
我们唯一一次与法律擦肩而过是在我们逃离的时候，三个人坐在车里的前排，后排装满了东西。突然我们看见一辆警车拐过弯来，朝我们开来，然后从我们身边开过去。他们只是在巡逻。但是从后视镜里，我们看到他们做了一个U型转弯，我们知道他们会闪我们停下来。他们在经过时发现了我们，把我们当成黑人，知道黑人在这个时间不应该出现在那个区域。这是一个紧张的情况。抢劫案正在进行中，我们知道不是只有我们这个团伙在工作，毫无疑问。但我知道很少有白人会认为一个黑人可以比他更聪明。在他们开始闪灯之前，我告诉Rudy停车。我做了我以前做过的事情——下车并挥手示意他们，向他们走去。当他们停下时，我在他们的车旁。我问他们，用像我这样的黑人那样结巴的语言问他们能否告诉我去罗克斯伯里的地址。他们告诉了我，然后我们继续做各自的事。
We were going along fine. We'd make a good pile and then lay low awhile, living it up. Shorty stillplayed with his band, Rudy never missed attending his sensitive old man, or the table-waiting athis exclusive parties, and the girls maintained their routine home schedules. 
我们一直过得很好。我们会赚很多钱，然后躲一段时间，好好享受一下。Shorty仍然和他的乐队一起玩， Rudy从来没有错过参加他敏感的老爸的活动，或者在等待着他的专属派对上大吃大喝，姑娘们也保持着平时的家庭日程安排。
Sometimes, I still took the girls out to places where Shorty played, and to other places, spendingmoney as though it were going out of style, the girls dressed in jewelry and furs they had selectedfrom our hauls. No one knew our hustle, but it was clear that we were doing fine. And sometimes,the girls would come over and we'd meet them either at Shorty's in Roxbury or in our HarvardSquare place, and just s moke reefers, and play music. It's a shame to tell on a man, but Shortywas so obsessed with the white girl that even if the lights were out, he would pull up the shade tobe able to see that white flesh by the street lamp from outside. 
有时候，我仍然带着姑娘们去Shorty演奏的地方以及其他一些地方，花钱大手大脚的，姑娘们穿着我们从劫掠中得到的珠宝和毛皮。没有人知道我们的勾当，但很明显我们过得很好。有时候，姑娘们会过来，我们会在罗克斯伯里的Shorty那里或在我们哈佛广场的地方见面，只是抽着烟，弹着音乐。告发一个男人是可耻的，但Shorty如此迷恋白人女孩，即使灯都灭了，他也会拉起窗帘，以便从外面通过路灯看到那白嫩的肌肤。
*     *     * 
Early evenings when we were laying low between jobs, I often went to a Massachusetts Avenuenightclub called the Savoy. And Sophia would telephone me there punctually. Even when wepulled jobs, I would leave from this club, then rush back there after the job . The reason was sothat if it was ever necessary, people could testify that they had seen me at just about the time thejob was pulled. Negroes being questioned by policemen would be very hard to pin down on anyexact time. 
傍晚时分，当我们在完成一项任务后暂时休息时，我经常去马萨诸塞大道的一家名为“萨沃伊”的夜总会。Sophia总是准时给我打电话。即使我们正在执行任务，我也会在这个俱乐部离开，然后任务完成后迅速返回这里。这样做的原因是，如果有人需要证明他们看到我在某个任务被取消的时间，他们就可以通过这个方式来证明。警察询问黑人关于某个时间的问题是很难确定的。
Boston at this time had two Negro detectives. Ever since I had come back on the Roxbury scene,one of these detectives, a dark brown fellow named Turner,had never been able to stand me, andit was mutual. He talked about what he would do to me, and I had promptly put an answer backon the wire. I knew from the way he began to act that he had heard it. Everyone knew that Icarried guns. And he did have sense enough to know that I wouldn't hesitate to use them-and onhim, detective or not. 
波士顿此时有两名黑人侦探。自从我回到罗克斯伯里的场景后，其中一名侦探，一个名叫特纳的深棕色家伙，从未能够忍受我，这是相互的。他谈论他会对我做什么，我立即回答了电话。我知道他开始行动的方式表明他已经听到了。每个人都知道我会携带枪支。而且他有足够敏锐的意识来知道他不会犹豫使用它们——无论是对他还是对其他任何人。
This early evening I was in this place when at the usual time, the phone in the booth rang. It rangjust as this detective Turner happened to walk in through the front door. He saw me start to getup, he knew the call was for me, but stepped inside the booth, and answered. 
这天傍晚，我正在这个地方时，电话亭里的电话响了起来。就在此时，侦探特纳碰巧从前面走进来，看到了我起身准备接电话，他知道这个电话是给我的，但是还是走进了电话亭里，接通了电话。
I heard him saying, looking straight at me, "Hello, hello, hello-" And I knew that Sophia, taking nochances with the strange voice, had hung up. 
我听到他直视着我说道：“你好，你好，你好——”我知道Sophia并不相信这个陌生的声音，所以她挂断了电话。
"Wasn't that call for me?" I asked Turner. 
我问特纳：“那通电话是给我的吗？”
He said that it was. 
他说是的。
I said, "Well, why didn't you say so?" 
我说：“好吧，你为什么不早说呢？”
He gave me a rude answer. I knew he wanted me to make a move, first. We both were beingcagey. We both knew that we wanted to kill each other. Neither wanted to say the wrong thing.Turner didn't want to say anything that, repeated, would make him sound bad. I didn't want to sayanything that could be interpreted as a threat to a cop. 
他粗鲁地回答了我。我知道他想让我先行动。我们两个都很谨慎。我们都知道我们想要杀死对方。谁都不想说错话。特纳不想说任何会让他听起来不好的话。我不想说任何可能被解释为对警察的威胁的话。
But I remember exactly what I said to him anyway, purposely loud enough for some people at thebar to hear me. I said, "You know, Turner-you're trying to make history. Don't you know that if youplay with me, you certainly will go down in history because you've got to kill me?" 
但我仍然记得我对他说了什么，故意让酒吧里一些人听到。我说：“特纳，你知道你在创造历史。你不知道如果你和我玩，你一定会留下历史，因为你必须杀了我吗？”
 Turner looked at me . Then he backed down. He walked on by me. I guess he wasn't ready tomake history. 
特纳看着我。然后他退却了。他走过我身边。我想他还没有准备好创造历史。
I had gotten to the point where I was walking on my own coffin. 
我已经走到了一个地步，即我在自己给自己制造棺材。
It's a law of the rackets that every criminal expects to get caught. He tries to stave off theinevitable for as long as he can. 
在犯罪活动中有一条定律，那就是每个罪犯都希望被抓住。他尽可能地拖延不可避免的结局。
Drugs helped me push the thought to the back of my mind. They were the center of my life. I hadgotten to the stage where every day I used enough drugs-reefers, cocaine, or both-so that I feltabove any worries, any strains. If any worries did manage to push their way through to thesurface of my consciousness, I could float them back where they came from until tomorrow, andthen until the next day. 
毒品帮助我把这个想法推到了我的脑海里。它们是我的生活中心。我已经走到了每天使用足够多的毒品的地步——快克、可卡因，或者两者兼有——这样我就感觉可以战胜任何担忧和压力。如果有任何担忧确实设法冲破了我的意识表面，我可以把它们推回到它们来的地方，直到明天，然后是下一天。
But where, always before, I had been able to smoke the reefers and to sniff the snow and rarelyshow it very much, by now it was not that easy. 
但以前我总是能够吸食快克，嗅闻着雪花，很少表现出什么来。现在却不是那么容易了。
One week when we weren't working-after a big haul-I was just staying high, and I was outnightclubbing. I came into this club, and from the bartender's face when he spoke, "Hello, Red," Iknew that something was wrong. But I didn't ask him anything. I've always had this rule-never askanybody in that kind of situation; they will tell you what they want you to know. But the bartenderdidn't get a chance to tell me, if he had meant to. When I sat down on a stool and ordered a drink,I saw them. 
我们不工作的那一周——在一次大收获之后——我一直处在兴奋状态，晚上去夜总会。我来到这家夜总会，从酒保说话时的表情中，“你好，红”，我知道有些不对劲。但我没有问他任何事情。我总有这个规矩——从不问任何人在这种情境下的事情；他们会告诉你他们想让你知道的。但酒保没有得到机会告诉我，如果他有意的话。当我坐在凳子上点了一杯酒后，我看到了他们。
Sophia and her sister sat at a table inside, near the dance floor, with a white man. 
索菲娅和她妹妹坐在舞池附近的一张桌子旁，和一位白人男子在一起。
I don't know how I ever made such a mistake as I next did. I could have talkedto her later. I didn'tknow, or care, who the white fellow was. My cocaine told me to get up. 
我不知道我怎么会犯这样的错误，就像我接下来做的一样。我可以晚些时候和她谈谈。我不知道，也不在乎那个白人男子是谁。我的可卡因让我站起来。
It wasn't Sophia's husband. It was his closest friend. They had served in the war together. Withher husband out of town, he had asked Sophia and her sister out to dinner, and they went. Butthen, later, after dinner, driving around, he had suddenly suggested going over to the blackghetto. 
那个人不是索菲亚的丈夫，而是他最亲密的朋友。他们一起参加了战争。由于她的丈夫不在家，他邀请了索菲亚和她的妹妹一起出去吃饭，于是她们就去了。但是在晚餐后，当他们开车转悠时，他突然建议去黑人区看看。
Every Negro who lives in a city has seen the type a thousand times, the Northern cracker who willgo to visit "niggertown," to be amused at "the coons." 
每个住在城市里的黑人都看过这种类型的事情一千次，那些北方佬会去参观“黑人区”，以取悦于“浣熊们”。
The girls, so well known in the Negro places in Roxbury, had tried to change his mind, but he hadinsisted. So they had just held their breaths coming into this club where they had been a hundredtimes. They walked in stiff-eyeing the bartenders and waiters who caught their message andacted as though they never had seen them before. And they were sitting there with drinks beforethem, praying that no Negro who knew them would barge up to their table. 
这些女孩在罗克斯伯里的黑人地方非常有名，她们试图改变他的想法，但他坚持要来。所以当他们来到这个他们已经来过一百次的俱乐部时，她们只是屏住呼吸。她们僵硬地看着酒保和服务员，他们捕捉到了她们的信息，并假装从未见过她们一样。然后她们坐在那里，面前有饮料，祈祷着没有认识她们的黑人会冲到她们的桌子前。
Then up I came. I know I called them "Baby." They were chalky-white, he was beet-red. 
然后我走了上去。我知道我叫她们“宝贝”。她们脸色苍白，而他却脸红了。
That same night, back at the Harvard Square place, I really got sick. It was less of a physicalsickness than it was all of the last five years catching up. I was in my pajamas in bed, half asleep,when I heard someone knock. 
那天晚上，在哈佛广场的地方，我真的病了。与其说是身体上的疾病，不如说是过去五年来所有的压力都累积在一起了。我穿着睡衣躺在床上，半睡半醒时听到有人敲门。
I knew that something was wrong. We all had keys. No one ever knocked at the door. I rolled oftand under the bed; I was so groggy it didn't cross my mind to grab for my gun on the dresser. 
我知道有些不对劲。我们都有钥匙，从来没有人敲过门。我翻身躲在床底下，头脑昏沉得没有想到去拿放在梳妆台上的枪。
Under the bed, I heard the key turn, and I saw the shoes and pants cuffs walk in. I watched themwalk around. I saw them stop. Every time they stopped, Iknew what the eyes were looking at. AndI knew, before he did, that he was going to get down and look under the bed. He did. It wasSophia's husband's friend. His face was about two feet from mine. It looked congealed. 
在床底下，我听到钥匙转动的声音，接着看到鞋子和裤子的袖口进来了。我看着它们四处走动。我看到它们停下来。每次它们停下来，我知道它们在看什么。而且我知道，在他动手之前，他会蹲下来看床底下有什么。他确实这么做了。那是索菲亚的丈夫的朋友。他的脸离我只有两英尺远。它看起来很凝固。
"Ha, ha, ha, I fooled you, didn't I?" I said. It wasn't at all funny. I got out from under the bed, stillfake-laughing. He didn't run, I'll say that for him. He stood back; he watched me as though I werea snake. 
“哈哈，我骗到你了吧？”我说。这一点也不好笑。我从床底下爬出来，仍然假装笑着。他没有逃跑，我得说他很有胆量。他站在一旁，像看一条蛇一样地看着我。
I didn't try to hide what he already knew. The girls had some things in the closets, and around; hehad seen all of that. We even talked some. I told him the girls weren't there, and he left. Whatshook me the most was realizing that I had trapped myself under the bed without a gun. I reallywas slipping. 
我没有试图隐瞒他已经知道了的事情。女孩们在壁橱里和周围有些东西，他已经看到了一切。我们甚至聊了聊天。我告诉他女孩们不在那里，然后他就离开了。让我最震惊的是意识到我没有枪却把自己困在床底下。我真的在下滑。
*     *     * 
I had put a stolen watch into a jewelry shop to replace a broken crystal. It was about two dayslater, when I went to pick up the watch, that things fell apart. 
我把一只偷来的手表放进了一家珠宝店，用来替换碎掉的水晶。大约两天后，我去取手表时事情败露了。
As I have said, a gun was as much a part of my dress as a necktie. I had my gun in a shoulderholster, under my coat. 
就像我说过的那样，枪和领带一样是我衣着的一部分。我的枪在肩挂枪套里，在我的外套下面。
The loser of the watch, the person from whom it had been stolen by us, I later found, haddescribed the repair that it needed. It was a very expensive watch, that's why I had kept it formyself. And all of the jewelers in Boston had been alerted. 
手表的失主，也就是我们偷走它的人后来描述了一下手表需要修复的情况。这是一只非常昂贵的手表，这就是为什么我一直留着它的原因。波士顿的所有珠宝商都得到了通知。
The Jew waited until I had paid him before he laid the watch on the counter. He gave his signal- and this other fellow suddenly appeared, from the back, walking toward me. 
那个犹太人等到我付款后，才把手表放在柜台上。他发出了信号——另一个家伙突然从后面出现，朝我走来。
One hand was in his pocket. I knew he was a cop.He said, quietly, "Step into the back." 
他的一只手在口袋里。我知道他是个警察。他平静地说：“走到后面去。”
Just as I started back there, an innocent Negro walked into the shop. I remember later hearingthat he had just that day gotten out of the military. The detective, thinking he was with me, turnedto him. 
就在我转身的时候，一个无辜的黑人走进了店里。我记得后来听说他那天刚刚从军队退役。侦探以为他是和我一伙的，便转向了他。
There I was, wearing my gun, and the detective talking to that Negro with his back to me. Today Ibelieve that Allah was with me even then. I didn't try to shoot him. And that saved my life. 
当时我身上带着枪，而侦探正背对着我和那个黑人交谈。如今我相信即使在那个时候安拉也与我同在。我没有试图开枪，而那救了我一命。
I remember that his name was Detective Slack. 
我记得他的名字叫做斯莱克警探。
I raised my arm, and motioned to him, "Here, take my gun." 
我举起我的手臂，向他示意：“拿着我的枪。”
I saw his face when he took it. He was shocked. Because of the sudden appearance of the otherNegro, he had never thought about a gun. It really moved him that I hadn't tried to kill him. 
当他接过枪时，我看到了他脸上的表情。他很震惊。由于另一个黑人的突然出现，他从未想过会有一支枪。我并没有试图杀死他，这真的让他很感动。
Then, holding my gun in his hand, he signaled. And out from where they had been concealedwalked two other detectives. They'd had me covered. One false move, I'd have been dead. 
然后，他拿着我的枪发出了信号。从他们藏身的地方出来了另外两个侦探。他们已经把我包围了。我只要稍有不慎就会被杀。
I was going to have a long time in prison to think about that. 
我将在监狱里度过很长一段时间来思考这个问题。
If I hadn't been arrested right when I was, I could have been dead another way. Sophia'shusband's friend had told her husband about me. And the husband had arrived that morning, andhad gone to the apartment with a gun, looking for me. He was at the apartment just about whenthey took me to the precinct. 
如果我没有在那个时候被捕，我可能会以另一种方式死去。索菲亚的丈夫的朋友告诉了他的丈夫关于我的事情。那个丈夫那天早上到了那里，带着一支枪去找我。就在他们将我带到警局的时候，他正在那个公寓里。
The detectives grilled me. They didn't beat me. They didn't even put a fingeron me. And I knew itwas because I hadn't tried to kill the detective. 
侦探们审问我。他们没有打我，甚至没有碰我一根手指头。我知道这是因为我没有试图杀死那个侦探。
They got my address from some papers they found on me. The girls soon were picked up. Shortywas pulled right off the bandstand that night. The girls also had implicated Rudy. To this day, Ihave always marveled at how Rudy, somehow, got the word, and I know he must have caught thefirst thing smoking out of Boston, and he got away. They never got him. 
他们从我身上找到的一些文件上获得了我的地址。女孩们很快被逮捕了。那天晚上，肖蒂被直接从舞台上拉下来。女孩们还牵连到了鲁迪。直到今天，我一直很惊讶于鲁迪是如何得到这个消息的，我知道他一定是第一个从波士顿出发的人，而且他逃掉了。他们从来没有抓到过他。
I have thought a thousand times, I guess, about how I so narrowly escaped death twice that day.That's why I believe that everything is written. 
我想我已经想过了成千上万次，那天我是如何侥幸逃脱死亡的。这就是为什么我相信一切都是注定的。
The cops found the apartment loaded with evidence-fur coats, some jewelry, other small stuff-plusthe tools of our trade. A jimmy, a lockpick, glass cutters, screwdrivers, pencil-beam flashlights,false keys. . . and my small arsenal of guns. The girls got low bail. They were still white-burglarsor not. Their worst crime was their involvement with Negroes. But Shorty and I had bail set at$10, 000 each, which they knew we were nowhere near able to raise. 
警察在公寓里发现了大量证据——毛皮大衣、一些珠宝、其他小物品，以及我们的工具——一把撬棍、一把开锁器、玻璃切割器、螺丝刀、铅笔、手电筒、假钥匙，还有我的小武器库。女孩们得到了低保释金。她们仍然是白贼还是不是呢？她们最大的罪行是与黑人有牵连。但是肖蒂和我得支付10,000美元的保释金，而她们知道我们根本拿不出来这么多钱。
The social workers worked on us. White women in league with Negroes was their mainobsession. The girls weren't so-called "tramps," or "trash," they were well-to-do upper-middle- class whites. That bothered the social workers and the forces of the law more than anything else. 
社会工作者对我们展开了调查。他们的主要关注点是白人女子和黑人勾结在一起。女孩们并不是所谓的“流浪汉”或“垃圾人”，而是富裕的上流社会白人。这比其他任何事情都更能引起社会工作者和法律力量的注意。
How, where, when, had I met them? Did we sleep together? Nobody wanted to know anything atall about the robberies. All they could see was that we had taken the white man's women. 
我是怎么认识她们的？在哪里、什么时候认识的？我们曾经睡在一起吗？没有人想知道任何关于抢劫的事情。他们只看到我们带走了那个白人男人的女人。
I just looked at the social workers: "Now, what do you think?" 
我只是看着社会工作者说：“现在，你们怎么想？”
Even the court clerks and the bailiffs: "Nice white girls . . . goddam niggers-" It was the same evenfrom our court-appointed lawyers as we sat down, underguard, at a table, as our hearingassembled. Before the judge e ntered, I said to one lawyer, "We seem to be getting sentencedbecause of those girls." He got red from the neck up and shuffled his papers: "You had nobusiness with white girls!" 
甚至连法庭职员和法警都在说：“漂亮的白人女孩……该死的黑鬼。”我们的指定律师也是如此，当我们坐在被告席上，由警卫看守着，等待开庭的时候，情况也是一样。在法官进入法庭之前，我对其中一位律师说道：“我们似乎要被判刑是因为那些女孩。”他从脖子红到了脸，慌乱地整理着他的文件：“你们没有理由和白人女孩有任何瓜葛！”
Later, when I had learned the full truth about the white man, I reflected many times that theaverage burglary sentence for a first offender, as we all were, was about two years. But weweren't going to get the average-not for _our_ crime. 
后来，当我了解了那个白人男子的整个真相后，我多次反思，对于一个初犯者，一般的盗窃罪刑期是两年左右。但我们不会得到一般量刑——对于我们的罪行来说不会。
*     *     * 
I want to say before I go on that I have never previously told anyone my sordid past in detail. Ihaven't done it now to sound as though I might be proud of how bad, how evil, I was. 
在我继续之前，我想说我从未向任何人详细讲述过我的卑鄙过去。我现在说出来不是为了听起来好像我很自豪于自己有多坏、多邪恶一样。
But people are always speculating-why am I as I am? To understand that of any person, hiswhole life, from birth, must be reviewed. All of our experiences fuse into our personality.Everything that ever happened to us is an ingredient. 
但是人们总是猜测——为什么我会变成这样？要理解任何一个人，他的整个人生，从出生开始，都必须被回顾。我们所有的经历融合到我们的个性中。所有发生在我们身上的事情都是一个成分。
Today, when everything that I do has an urgency, I would not spend one hour in the preparation ofa book which had the ambition to perhaps titillate some readers. But I am spending many hoursbecause the full story is the best way that I know to have it seen, and understood, that I had sunkto the very bottom of the American white man's society when-soon now, in prison-I found Allahand the religion of Islam and it completely transformed my life. 
今天，当我做每一件事情都充满紧迫感的时候，我不会花一个小时的时间来准备一本有可能刺激一些读者的书。但是我会花很多时间，因为完整的故事是我知道的最好的方式去呈现它并让人们了解我曾经深陷在美国白人社会的最底层，而不久之后，在监狱里，我找到了真主安拉和伊斯兰教，这完全改变了我的生活。
CHAPTER TEN 
第十章
SATAN 
撒旦 (Satan)
 Shorty didn't know what the word "concurrently" meant. 
Shorty不知道“concurrently”这个单词的意思。
Somehow, Lansing-to-Boston bus fare had been scraped up by Shorty's old mother. "Son, readme Book of Revelations and pray to God!" she had kept telling Shorty, visiting him, and once me,while we awaited our sentencing. Shorty had read the Bible's Revelation pages; he had actuallygotten down on his knees, praying like some Negro Baptist deacon. 
不知何故，从兰辛到波士顿的车费被矮子的老母亲凑了起来。“儿子，给我读一本《启示录》，向上帝祈祷！”在我们等待判决的时候，她不停地对矮子说，去看他，还有一次去看我。矮子读过圣经的启示录。他真的跪下来，像黑人浸礼会执事一样祈祷。
Then we were looking up at the judge in Middlesex County Court. (Our, I think, fourteen counts ofcrime were committed in that county. ) Shorty's mother was sitting, sobbing with her head bowingup and down to her Jesus, over near Ella and Reginald. Shorty was the first of us called to standup. 
然后我们抬头看着梅德斯通县法院的法官。（我想，我们的十四项罪行都是在那个县犯下的。）Shorty的母亲坐在那里，头朝上朝下地哭着，她的耶稣在身边，Ella和Reginald旁边。我们中第一个被叫站起来的是Shorty。
"Count one, eight to ten years- "Count two, eight to ten years- "Count three. . ." 
"第一，八年到十年- "第二，八年到十年- "第三。 . . "
And, finally, "The sentences to run concurrently." 
最后是“同时执行的判决。”
Shorty, sweating so hard that his black face looked as though it had been greased, and notunderstanding the word "concurrently," had counted in his head to probably over a hundred years;he cried out, he began slumping. The bailiffs had to catch and support him. 
Shorty满头大汗，黑脸看起来像抹了油一样，他不懂“同时执行”的意思，在脑海中数着可能超过一百年的刑期；他开始呼喊并瘫倒在地。法警不得不抓住他并支撑着他。
In eight to ten seconds, Shorty had turned as atheist as I had been to start with. 
在八到十秒钟内，Shorty变得和我一样不相信上帝了。
I got ten years. 
我被判十年。
 The girls got one to five years, in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham, Massachusetts. 
女孩们被判一到五年，在马萨诸塞州弗明翰的妇女教养所服刑。
This was in February, 1946. I wasn't quite twenty-one. I had not even started shaving. 
那是在1946年2月，我还不到21岁。我甚至还没有开始刮胡子。
They took Shorty and me, handcuffed together, to the Charlestown State Prison. 
他们带着被铐在一起的我和Shorty，去了查尔斯顿州立监狱。
I can't remember any of my prison numbers. That seems surprising, even after the dozen yearssince I have been out of prison. Because your number in prison became part of you. You neverheard your name, only your number. On all of your clothing, every item, was your number,stenciled. It grew stenciled on your brain. 
我记不得我的监狱编号了。即使我已经出狱十几年，这似乎仍然令人惊讶。因为在监狱里，你的编号已经成为了你的一部分。你从没听过自己的名字，只有编号。在你的所有衣物上，每一个物品上都印着你的编号，深深地刻在了你的大脑中。
Any person who claims to have deep feeling for other human beings should think a long, longtime before he votes to have other men kept behind bars-caged. I am not saying there shouldn'tbe prisons, but there shouldn't be bars. Behind bars, a man never reforms. He will never forget.He never will get completely over the memory of the bars. 
任何声称对其他人有深厚感情的人，在投票将他人关押进牢房之前都应该深思熟虑。我不是说不应该有监狱，但是不应该有铁栏。在牢房里，一个人永远不会改过自新。他永远不会忘记。他永远不会完全忘记铁栏的记忆。
After he gets out, his mind tries to erase the experience, but he can't. I've talked with numerousformer convicts. It has been very interesting to me to find that all of our minds had blotted awaymany details of years in prison. But in every case, he will tell you that he can't forget those bars. 
他出狱后，他的头脑试图抹去这段经历，但他做不到。我与许多前罪犯交谈过。我发现我们所有人的头脑都抹去了在监狱里度过的许多细节，这对我来说非常有趣。但在每个案例中，他都会告诉你他无法忘记那些铁栏。
As a "fish" (prison slang for a new inmate) at Charlestown, I was physically miserable and as evil- tempered as a snake, being suddenly without drugs. The cells didn't have running water. Theprison had been built in 1805-in Napoleon's day-and was even styled after the Bastille. In thedirty, cramped cell, I could lie on my cot and touch both walls. The toilet was a covered pail; Idon'tcare how strong you are, you can't stand having to smell a whole cell row of defecation. 
作为查尔斯敦监狱（Charlestown State Prison）的“鱼”（新犯人的监狱俚语），我感到身体十分痛苦，而且像一条蛇一样脾气暴躁，因为没有了药物。牢房没有自来水。这座监狱建于1805年，拿破仑时代，甚至模仿巴士底狱的风格。在肮脏而狭窄的牢房里，我可以躺在我的床上，伸手就可以摸到两边的墙壁。厕所是一个盖着桶子的蹲厕；无论你有多强壮，都无法忍受整个牢房一排排的大便气味。
The prison psychologist interviewed me and he got called every filthy name I could think of, andthe prison chaplain got called worse. My first letter, I remember, was from my religious brotherPhilbert in Detroit, telling me his "holiness" church was going to pray for me. I scrawled him areply I'm ashamed to think of today. 
监狱心理学家采访了我，我能用想到的所有肮脏的字眼来形容他。监狱牧师也受到了更糟糕的对待。我记得我的第一封信是来自我在底特律的兄弟菲尔伯特，告诉我他的“圣洁”教堂会为我祈祷。我草草回复了他，今天我为此感到羞愧。
Ella was my first visitor. I remember seeing her catch herself, then try to smile at me, now in thefaded dungarees stenciled with my number. Neither of us could find much to say, until I wishedshe hadn't come at all. The guards with guns watched about fifty convicts and visitors. I haveheard scores of new prisoners swearing back in their cells that when free their first act would beto waylay those visiting-room guards. Hatred often focused on them. 
埃拉是我的第一个访客。我记得看到她抓住自己，然后试图对我微笑，穿着现在已经褪色的带有我编号的囚服。我们两个都找不到什么话可说，直到我希望她根本没有来过。手持枪支的警卫们监视着大约50名罪犯和访客。我听到许多新犯人在牢房里发誓，一旦获得自由，他们的第一项行动将是袭击那些探访室的警卫。仇恨往往集中在他们身上。
I first got high in Charlestown on nutmeg. My cellmate was among at least a hundred nutmegmen who, for money or cigarettes, bought from kitchen-worker inmates penny matchboxes full ofstolen nutmeg. I grabbed a box as though it were a pound of heavy drugs. Stirred into a glass ofcold water, a penny matchbox full of nutmeg had the kick of three or four reefers. 
我第一次在查尔斯敦使用肉豆蔻获得高潮。我的牢房同伴中至少有一百个使用肉豆蔻的人，他们为了钱或香烟，从厨房犯人那里购买了满满一盒被偷走的肉豆蔻的便士火柴盒。我抓起一盒，就像抓了一大袋重毒品一样。加入一杯冷水中，满满一盒肉豆蔻的便士火柴盒会有三到四支烟那么大的威力。
With some money sent by Ella, I was finally able to buy stuff for better highs from guards in theprison. I got reefers, Nembutal, and benzedrine. Smuggling to prisoners was the guards' sideline;every prison's inmates know that's how guards make most of their living. 
在埃拉寄来的一些钱的帮助下，我终于能够从监狱的警卫那里买到更好的毒品。我买了雷射香烟、尼美舒利和苯环丙胺。向囚犯走私是警卫的副业；每个监狱的囚犯都知道这是警卫谋生的主要方式。
I served a total of seven years in prison. Now, when I try to separate that first year-plus that Ispent at Charlestown, it runs all together in a memory of nutmeg and the other semi-drugs, ofcursing guards, throwing things out of my cell, balking in the lines, dropping my tray in the dininghall, refusing to answermy number-claiming I forgot it-and things like that. 
我总共在监狱里服刑了七年。现在，当我试图将我在查尔斯敦度过的第一年以及随后的时间分开来时，它们都混成了一段关于肉豆蔻和其他半毒品、诅咒警卫、从牢房里扔东西、排队时犹豫不决、在餐厅里掉盘子、拒绝回答自己的编号声称自己忘记了，以及诸如此类的事情的记忆。
I preferred the solitary that this behavior brought me. I would pace for hours like a caged leopard,viciously cursing aloud to myself. And my favorite targets were the Bible and God. But there wasa legal limit to how much time one could be kept in solitary. Eventually, the men in the cellblockhad a name for me: "Satan." Because of my antireligious attitude. 
我更喜欢这种独处的行为带给我的孤独感。我会像一只被关在笼子里的豹子一样踱步数小时，恶毒地大声咒骂着自己。而我最喜欢攻击的目标是《圣经》和上帝。但是一个人可以被单独监禁的时间是有限的。最终，牢房里的囚犯给我起了个绰号：“恶魔”，因为我的反宗教态度。
The first man I met in prison who made any positive impression on me whatever was a fellowinmate, "Bimbi." I met him in 1947, at Charlestown. He was a light, kind of red-complexionedNegro, as I was; about my height, and he had freckles. Bimbi, an old-time burglar, had been inmany prisons. In the license plate shop where our gang worked, he operated the machine thatstamped out the numbers. I was along the conveyor belt where the numbers were painted. 
我在监狱里遇到的第一位给我留下深刻印象的人，不管他是不是我的同室犯人，“比姆比”。我于1947年在查尔斯敦遇见了他。他是一位浅肤色的黑人，和我一样，身高差不多，而且有雀斑。比姆比是一位老练的盗贼，已经在许多监狱里服过刑了。在我们帮派的车牌店里，他操作着打上号码的机器。而我则站在涂有号码的传送带上。
Bimbi was the first Negro convict I'd known who didn't respond to "What'cha know, Daddy?"Often, after we had done our day's license plate quota, we would sit around, perhaps fifteen of us,and listen to Bimbi. Normally, white prisoners wouldn't think of listening to Negro prisoners'opinions on anything, but guards, even, would wander over close to hear Bimbi on any subject. 
比姆比是我所认识的第一位黑人囚犯，他不会回答“你懂个屁，老爹？”通常，在我们完成了当天的车牌配额后，我们会围坐在一起，大约有十五个人，听比姆比讲故事。通常情况下，白人囚犯不会考虑听取黑人囚犯对任何事情的看法，但是警卫甚至会走到近前，听比姆比谈论任何话题。
He would have a cluster of people riveted, often on odd subjects you never would think of. Hewould prove to us, dipping into the science of human behavior, that the only difference betweenus and outside people was that we had been caught. He liked to talk about historical events andfigures. When he talked about the history of Concord, where I was to be transferred later, youwould have thought he was hired by the Chamber of Commerce, and I wasn't the first inmate whohad never heard of Thoreau until Bimbi expounded upon him. Bimbi was known as the library'sbest customer. What fascinated me with him most of all was that he was the first man I had everseen command total respect. . . with his words.Bimbi seldom said much to me; he was gruff to individuals, but I sensed he liked me. W hat mademe seek his friendship was when I heard him discuss religion. I considered myself beyondatheism-I was Satan. But Bimbi put the atheist philosophy in a framework, so to speak. Thatended my vicious cursing attacks. My approach sounded so weak alongside his, and he neverused a foul word. 
他会吸引一群人聚精会神地听他讲故事，通常讲述一些你从没想过的奇怪话题。他会向我们证明，人类行为学告诉我们，我们和外界的人唯一的不同就是我们被抓到了。他喜欢谈论历史事件和人物。当他谈到康科德的历史时，我后来被转到了那里，你会觉得他是被商会雇来做宣传的，而在我第一次听到比姆比详细阐述梭罗之前，我并不是第一个不知道他的囚犯。比姆比被称为图书馆最好的客户。最让我着迷的是他是我见过的第一个以言辞赢得完全尊重的人。比姆比很少和我说话；他对个人很粗鲁，但我感觉到他喜欢我。让我寻求他友谊的原因是当我听到他讨论宗教时。我认为自己已经超越了无神论-我是恶魔。但比姆比将无神论哲学放在了一个框架里，这样结束了我的恶毒咒骂攻击。我的方式与他相比听起来太软弱了，而且他从不用脏话。
Out of the blue one day, Bimbi told me flatly, as was his way, that I had some brains, if I'd usethem. I had wanted his friendship, not that kind of advice. I might have cursed another convict,but nobody cursed Bimbi. He told me I should take advantage of the prison correspondencecourses and the library. 
有一天，比姆比用他一贯的直率语气突然告诉我，说我有点头脑，只要我好好利用。我想要的是他的朋友情谊，而不是这种建议。我可能会骂另一个囚犯，但没有人会骂比姆比。他告诉我，我应该利用监狱的函授课程和图书馆。
When I had finished the eighth grade back in Mason, Michigan, that was the last time I'd thoughtof studying anything that didn't have some hustle purpose. And the streets had erased everythingI'd ever learned in school; I didn't know a verb from a house. My sister Hilda had written asuggestion that, if possible in prison, I should study English and penmanship; she had barelybeen able to read a couple of picture postcards I had sent her when I was selling reefers on theroad. 
当我在密歇根州的梅森完成了八年级学业时，那是我最后一次考虑学习没有目的的事情。而街道已经抹去了我在学校的所学；我分不清一个动词和一个名词。我的姐姐希尔达建议，如果可能的话，我应该在监狱里学习英语和书法；当她在街上卖香烟时，她几乎无法读懂我寄给她的一些明信片。
So, feeling I had time on my hands, I did begin a correspondence course in English. When themimeographed listings of available books passed from cell to cell, I would put my number next totitles that appealed to me which weren't already taken. 
因此，我感觉我有很多空闲时间，我开始参加英语函授课程。当手写的书名列表从一个牢房传到另一个牢房时，我会在对我有吸引力的书目旁边写上我的号码，这些书目还没有被拿走。
Through the correspondence exercises and lessons, some of the mechanics of grammargradually began to come back to me. 
通过函授课程和练习，我逐渐恢复了一些语法知识。
After about a year, I guess, I could write a decent and legible letter. About then, too, influenced byhaving heard Bimbi often explain word derivations, Iquietly started another correspondencecourse-in Latin. 
我想大概过了一年，我能够写出一封通顺且易读的信件。大约在那个时候，受到比姆比经常解释单词衍生词的影响，我悄悄地开始了另一门函授课程-拉丁语。
Under Bimbi's tutelage, too, I had gotten myself some little cellblock swindles going. For packs ofcigarettes, I beat just about anyone at dominoes. I always had several cartons of cigarettes in mycell; they were, in prison, nearly as valuable a medium of exchange as money. I booked cigaretteand money bets on fights and ball games. I'll never forget the prison sensation created that day inApril, 1947, when Jackie Robinson was brought up to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers. JackieRobinson had, then, his most fanatic fan in me. When he played, my ear was glued to the radio,and no game ended without my refiguring his average up through his last turn at bat. 
在比姆比的指导下，我还开展了一些小的牢房欺诈活动。对于一包香烟，我可以打败任何玩多米诺骨牌的人。我的牢房里总是有几盒香烟；在监狱里，它们几乎和钱一样有价值。我在打架和球赛中下注买香烟和金钱。我永远不会忘记1947年4月那个创造监狱氛围的日子，当时杰基·罗宾逊被带到了布鲁克林道奇队。那时，杰基·罗宾逊有了我最狂热的粉丝。当他比赛时，我会把耳朵贴在收音机上，每场比赛结束前，我都会重新计算他最后一次击球的平均得分。

One day in 1948, after I had been transferred to Concord Prison, my brother Philbert, who wasforever joining something, wrote me this time that he had discovered the "natural religion for theblack man." He belonged now, he said, to something called "the Nation of Islam." He said I should"pray to Allah for deliverance." I wrote Philbert a letter which, although in improved English, wasworse than my earlier reply to his news that I was being prayed for by his "holiness" church. 
1948年，在被转移到康科德监狱后，我的弟弟菲尔伯特总是参加各种活动。这一次，他写信给我说，他已经发现了“黑人的自然宗教”。他说现在他是“国家伊斯兰组织”的成员。他说我应该“向阿拉祈求解救”。我给菲尔伯特写了一封信，尽管我的英语有所改善，但比我早先回复他的新闻还要糟糕，即他的“神圣教会”为我祈祷。
When a letter from Reginald arrived, I never dreamed of associating the two letters, although Iknew that Reginald had been spending a lot of time with Wilfred, Hilda, and Philbert in Detroit.Reginald's letter was newsy, and also it contained this instruction: "Malcolm, don't eat any morepork, and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison." 
当雷金纳德的一封信到达时，我从未想过把这两封信联系起来，尽管我知道雷金纳德一直在底特律花很多时间与威尔弗雷德、希尔达和菲尔伯特在一起。雷金纳德的信很新闻，还包含以下指示：“马尔科姆，不要再吃任何猪肉，也不要再抽任何香烟。我会教你如何离开监狱。”
My automatic response was to think he had come upon some way I could work a hype on thepenal authorities. I went to sleep-and woke up-trying to figure what kind of a hype it could be.Something psychological, such as my act withthe New York draft board? Could I, after goingwithout pork and smoking no cigarettes for a while, claim some physical trouble that could bringabout my release? 
我的第一反应是认为他找到了一种我可以在监狱当局中炒作的方法。我睡觉，然后醒来，试图思考这是一种什么样的炒作。可能是某种心理方面的炒作，比如我和纽约征兵委员会的行为？我是否可以在一段时间内不吃猪肉、不抽烟之后，声称自己有一些身体问题，这可能会让我被释放？
"Get out of prison." The words hung in the air around me, I wanted out so badly. 
“离开监狱。”这句话在我周围飘荡，我非常想离开。
I wanted, in the worst way, to consult with Bimbi about it. But something big, instinct said, youspilled to nobody. 
我很想，在最糟糕的情况下，向比姆比咨询。但直觉告诉我，有些大事不能告诉任何人。
Quitting cigarettes wasn't going to be too difficult. I had been conditioned by days in solitarywithout cigarettes. Whatever this chance was, I wasn't going to fluff it. After I read that letter, Ifinished the pack I then had open. I haven't smoked another cigarette to this day, since 1948. 
戒烟并不会太困难。在没有香烟的单独监禁中，我已经适应了几天。无论这个机会是什么，我都不会浪费它。读完那封信后，我结束了我打开的那包烟。从1948年至今，我再也没抽过一根烟。
It was about three or four days later when pork was served for the noon meal. 
大约三四天后，午餐时间供应猪肉。
I wasn't even thinking about pork when I took my seat at the long table. Sit-grab-gobble-stand-fileout; that was the Emily Post in prison eating. When the meat platter was passed to me, I didn'teven know what the meat was; usually, you couldn't tell, anyway-but it was suddenly as though_don't eat any more pork_ flashed on a screen before me. 
当我坐在长桌前时，我甚至没有想过猪肉。坐抢吞站出；这是监狱里的Emily Post饮食规则。当肉盘传到我面前时，我甚至不知道那是肉；通常你无法分辨出来，无论如何——但它突然像是“不要再吃猪肉”的字样闪现在我的眼前。
I hesitated, with the platter in mid-air; then I passed it along to the inmate waiting next to me. Hebegan serving himself; abruptly, he stopped. I remember him turning, looking surprised at me. 
我犹豫了一下，肉盘悬在半空中；然后我把它传给坐在我旁边的囚犯。他开始自己盛菜；突然，他停下来。我记得他转过头来，惊讶地看着我。
I said to him, "I don't eat pork." 
我对他说：“我不吃肉。”
The platter then kept on down the table. 
然后，肉盘继续沿着桌子传下去。
  It was the funniest thing, the reaction, and the way that it spread. In prison, where so little breaksthe monotonous routine, the smallest thing causes a commotion of talk. It was being mentionedall over the cell block by night that Satan didn't eat pork. 
这是最有趣的事情，反应和传播方式。在监狱里，没有什么可以打破单调乏味的例行公事，最小的事情会引起一阵喧闹的谈话。整座牢房都在谈论这个晚上，撒旦不吃猪肉的话题。
It made me very proud, in some odd way. One of the universal images of the Negro, in prison andout, was that he couldn't do without pork. It made me feel good to see that my not eating it hadespecially startled the white convicts. 
这在某种程度上让我感到非常自豪。黑人在监狱内外的一个普遍形象是他不能没有猪肉。看到我不吃肉的行为特别让白人囚犯感到惊讶，这让我感觉很好。
Later I would learn, when I had read and studied Islam a good deal, that, unconsciously, my firstpre-Islamic submission had been manifested. I had experienced, for the first time, the Muslimteaching, "If you will take one step toward Allah-Allah will take two steps toward you." 
后来，当我读了很多关于伊斯兰教的书籍和研究后，我才知道，不知不觉中，我第一次在伊斯兰之前的顺从已经表现出来了。我第一次体验到了穆斯林的教义：“如果你向安拉（Allah）迈出一步，安拉会向你迈出两步。”
My brothers and sisters in Detroit and Chicago had all become converted to what they were beingtaught was the "natural religion for the black man" of which Philbert had written to me. They allprayed for me to become converted while I was in prison. But after Philbert reported my viciousreply, they discussed what was the best thing to do. They had decided that Reginald, the latestconvert, the one to whom I felt closest, would best know how to approach me, since he knew meso well in the street life. 
我在底特律和芝加哥的兄弟姐妹们都已经成为了他们所接受的“黑人的自然宗教”，这是菲尔伯特曾经写信给我提到的。他们在我狱中时都为我祈祷让我转变信仰。但是，在菲尔伯特报道了我的恶意回复之后，他们讨论了最好的解决方法。他们决定，最新转变信仰的雷金纳德，也就是我最亲近的人，最了解如何接近我，因为他在街头生活中非常了解我。
Independently of all this, my sister Ella had been steadily working to get me transferred to theNorfolk, Massachusetts, Prison Colony, which was an experimental rehabilitation jail. In otherprisons, convicts often said that if you had the right money, or connections, you could gettransferred to this Colony whose penal policies sounded almost too good to be true. Somehow,Ella's efforts in my behalf were successful in late 1948, and I was transferred to Norfolk. 
与此同时，我妹妹艾拉一直在努力地争取把我转移到马萨诸塞州诺福克的实验性改造监狱。在其他监狱里，囚犯们经常说如果你有足够的钱或者关系，你就可以被转移到这个殖民地，其刑罚政策听起来几乎太好以至于不可信。不知何故，艾拉代表我的努力在1948年底取得了成功，我被转移到了诺福克。
The Colony was, comparatively, a heaven, in many respects. It had flushing toilets; there were nobars, only walls-and within the walls, you had far more freedom. There was plenty of fresh air tobreathe; it was not in a city. 
相对而言，这个殖民地在很多方面都是天堂。它有抽水马桶；没有酒吧，只有墙壁——而且在墙壁内，你拥有更多的自由。有足够的新鲜空气可以呼吸；它不在城市里。
There were twenty-four "house" units, fifty men living in each unit, if memory serves me correctly.This would mean that the Colony had a total of around 1200 inmates. Each "house" had threefloors and, greatest blessing of all, each inmate had his own room. 
我记得每个“house”单元住着50个人，共有24个这样的单元。这意味着这个殖民地总共有大约1200名囚犯。每个“house”有三层楼，最重要的是，每个囚犯都有自己的房间。
About fifteen per cent of the inmates were Negroes, distributed about five to nine Negroes in eachhouse. 
大约15%的囚犯是黑人，每个“house”大约有5到9名黑人囚犯。
Norfolk Prison Colony represented the most enlightened form of prison that I have ever heard of.In place of the atmosphere of malicious gossip, perversion, grafting, hateful guards, there wasmore relative "culture," as "culture" is interpreted in prisons. A high percentage of the NorfolkPrison Colony inmates went in for "intellectual" things, group discussions, debates, and such.Instructors for the educational rehabilitation programs came from Harvard, Boston University, andother educational institutions in the area. The visiting rules, far more lenient than other prisons',permitted visitors almost every day, and allowed them to stay two hours. You had your choice ofsitting alongside your visitor, or facing each other. 
诺福克监狱殖民地代表了我所听说过的最开明的监狱形式。在恶意流言、堕落、贪污、讨厌的警卫的气氛之外，有更多相对“文化”，正如监狱中解释的“文化”一样。诺福克监狱殖民地囚犯中有很大一部分从事“智力”活动，如小组讨论、辩论等。教育改造项目的讲师来自哈佛大学、波士顿大学和该地区其他教育机构。参观规则比其他地方的监狱宽松得多，几乎每天都允许访客，并允许他们停留两个小时。你可以选择与你的访客坐在一起，或者面对面坐着。
Norfolk Prison Colony's library was one of its outstanding features. A millionaire named Parkhursthad willed his library there; he had probably been interested in the rehabilitation program. Historyand religions were his special interests. Thousands of his books were on the shelves, and in theback were boxes and crates full, for which there wasn't space on the shelves. At Norfolk, wecould actually go into the library, with permission-walk up and down the shelves, pick books.There were hundreds of old volumes, some of them probably quite rare. I read aimlessly, until Ilearned to read selectively, with a purpose.I hadn't heard from Reginald in a good while after I gotto Norfolk Prison Colony. But I had come in there not smoking cigarettes, or eating pork when itwas served. That caused a bit of eyebrow-raising. Then a letter from Reginald telling me when hewas coming to see me. By the time he came, I was really keyed up to hear the hype he was goingto explain. 
诺福克监狱殖民地的图书馆是其杰出特色之一。一位名叫Parkhurst的百万富翁将他的图书馆捐赠给了那里，他可能对改造计划感兴趣。历史和宗教是他的特别兴趣所在。数千本书摆放在书架上，而在后面的箱子和板条箱里也堆满了书，书架上已经没有足够的空间了。在诺福克，我们可以获得允许进入图书馆，随意地走上书架，挑选书籍。有数百本古老的版本，其中一些可能相当罕见。我漫无目的地阅读，直到学会有目的地选择性阅读。在来到诺福克监狱殖民地后，我没有听到Reginald的消息已经很久了。但我来时没有吸烟或吃肉食，这引起了一些人的注意。然后，Reginald写信告诉我他要来看我。当他到来时，我已经非常期待听到他要解释的事情了。
Reginald knew how my street-hustler mind operated. That's why his approach was so effective. 
雷金纳德知道我街头骗子的心思如何运作。这就是为什么他的方法是那么有效的原因。
He had always dressed well, and now, when he came to visit, was carefully groomed. I wasaching with wanting the "no pork and cigarettes" riddle answered. But he talked about the family,what was happening in Detroit, Harlem the last time he was there. I have never pushed anyone totell me anything before he is ready. The offhand way Reginald talked and acted made me knowthat something big was coming. 
他总是穿得很好，现在他来看我时也精心打扮。我渴望着解开“不吃肉和吸烟”的谜题。但他谈到了家庭、底特律最近发生的事情以及上次他去哈莱姆时的情况。在他没有准备好之前，我从未强迫任何人告诉我任何事情。雷金纳德随意的谈话和行为让我知道他即将有重大事件发生。
He said, finally, as though it had just happened to come into his mind, "Malcolm, if a man knewevery imaginable thing that there is to know, who would he be?" 
最后，他好像突然想到什么似的说：“马尔科姆，如果一个人知道所有可以想象到的事情，那他会是谁呢？”
Back in Harlem, he had often liked to get at something through this kind of indirection. It had oftenirritated me, because my way had always been direct. I looked at him. "Well, he would have to besome kind of a god-" 
在哈莱姆，他经常喜欢通过这种间接的方式来表达某些事情。这常常让我感到恼怒，因为我的方式一直是直接的。我看着他说：“嗯，他必须得是一个某种类型的神……”
Reginald said, "There's a _man_ who knows everything." 
雷金纳德说：“有一位人知道所有事情。”
I asked, "Who is that?" 
我问：“那是谁？”
"God is a man," Reginald said. "His real name is Allah." 
“上帝是一个人，”雷金纳德说，“他的真名是安拉。”
_Allah_. That word came back to me from Philbert's letter; it was my first hintof any connection.But Reginald went on. He said that God had 360 degrees of knowledge. He said that 360degrees represented "the sum total of knowledge." 
“安拉”这个词来自菲尔伯特的信，它是我的第一个线索。但雷金纳德继续说下去。他说上帝拥有360度的知识和智慧。他说360度代表了“知识的总体”。
To say I was confused is an understatement. I don't have to remind you of the backgroundagainst which I sat hearing my brother Reginald talk like this. I just listened, knowing he wastaking his time in putting me onto something. And if somebody is trying to put you ontosomething, you need to listen. 
说我是困惑的是一个低估。我不需要提醒你，我听到我的兄弟雷金纳德这样谈话的背景是什么。我只是听着，知道他在花时间让我了解某件事情。如果有人试图让你了解某件事情，你需要倾听。
"The devil has only thirty-three degrees of knowledge-known as Masonry," Reginald said. I can sospecifically remember the exact phrases since, later, I was going to teach them so many times toothers. "The devil uses his Masonry to rule other people." 
“魔鬼只有33度的知识和称为共济会，”雷金
He told me that this God had come to America, and that he had made himself known to a mannamed Elijah-"a black man, just like us." This God had let Elijah know, Reginald said, that thedevil's "time was up." 
他告诉我，这个上帝来到美国，他向一个名叫以利亚的人展示了自己——一个黑人，和我们一样。雷金纳德说，这个上帝让以利亚知道，魔鬼的“时间到了”。
I didn't know what to think. I just liste ned. 
我不知道该想什么，我只是听着。
"The devil is also a man," Reginald said. 
“魔鬼也是一个人类，”雷金纳德说。
"What do you mean?" 
“你是什么意思？”
With a slight movement of his head, Reginald indicated some white inmates and their visitorstalking, as we were, across the room. 
雷金纳德稍微点了点头，指着一些白人囚犯和他们的访客在房间另一边交谈。
"Them," he said. "The white man is the devil." 
“他们，”他说，“白人是魔鬼。”
He told me that all whites knew they were devils-"especially Masons." 
他告诉我，所有的白人都知道他们是魔鬼——特别是共济会成员
  I never will forget: my mind was involuntarily flashing across the entire spectrum of white people Ihad ever known; and for some reason it stopped upon Hymie, the Jew, who had been so good tome. 
我永远不会忘记：我的脑海里不由自主地闪过了我所有认识的白人，不知为何停在了那个曾经对我很好的犹太人海米身上。
Reginald, a couple of times, had gone out with me to that Long Island bootlegging operation tobuy and bottle up the bootleg liquor for Hymie. 
雷金纳德有过几次和我一起去长岛的私酿酒厂，为海米购买和装瓶私酿酒。
I said, "Without any exception?" 
我说：“一个都没有吗？”
"Without any exception." 
“一个都没有。”
"What about Hymie?" 
“那海米呢？”
"What is it if I let you make five hundred dollars to let me make ten thousand?" 
“如果我让你赚500美元，让我赚1万美元呢？”
After Reginald left, I thought. I thought. Thought. 
雷金纳德离开后，我想了想。我想了想。
I couldn't make of it head, or tail, or middle. 
我无法理解它的意思，头、尾或中间。
The white people I had known marched before my mind's eye. From the start of my life. The statewhite people always in our house after the other whites I didn't know had killed my father. . . thewhite people who kept calling my mother "crazy" to her face and before me and my brothers andsisters, until she finally was taken off by white people to the Kalamazoo asylum . . . the whitejudge a nd others who had split up the children . . . the Swerlins, the other whites around Mason. .. white youngsters I was in school there with, and the teachers-the one who told me in the eighthgrade to "be a carpenter" because thinking of being a lawyer was foolish for a Negro. . . . 
我所认识的白人在我脑海中浮现。从我出生开始，白人总是在我们家里出现，其他我不知道的白人杀死了我的父亲…那些白人当着我妈妈的面和我的兄弟姐妹们说她“疯”，直到她最终被白人带走到卡拉马祖的精神病院…法官和其他分割孩子的白人…斯威林家，梅森周围的其他白人…我在那所学校里遇到的白人年轻人和老师——那个在八年级告诉我“当木匠”的人，因为认为当律师对黑人来说很愚蠢…
My head swam with the parading faces of white people. The ones in Boston, inthe white-onlydances at the Roseland Ballroom where I shined their shoes. . . at the Parker House where I tooktheir dirty plates back to the kitchen. . . the railroad crewmen and passengers . . . Sophia . . . . 
我的脑海里浮现出白人的面容。波士顿的那些白人，在只有白人能参加的玫瑰园舞厅里跳舞时我为他们擦鞋子…在帕克豪斯酒店，我把他们的脏盘子拿回厨房…铁路工人和乘客…索菲亚…
The whites in New York City-the cops, the white criminals I'd dealt with. . . the whites who piledinto the Negro speakeasies for a taste of Negro _soul_ . . . the white women who wanted Negromen. . . the men I'd steered to the black "specialty sex" they wanted . . . . 
纽约市的白人——警察，我打过交道的白人罪犯......白人涌入黑人地下酒吧，品尝黑人的灵魂......想要黑人的白人妇女......我引导的男人去做他们想要的黑人“专业性爱”。
The fence back in Boston, and his ex-con representative. . . Boston cops . . . Sophia's husband'sfriend, and her husband, whom I'd never seen, but knew so much about . . . Sophia's sister . . .the Jew jeweler who'd helped trap me . . . the social workers . . . the Middlesex County Courtpeople . . . the judge who gave me ten years . . . the prisoners I'd known, the guards and theofficials . . . . 
波士顿的围栏，他的前代表. . .波士顿警察. . .索菲亚丈夫的朋友，还有她从未见过但了解很多的丈夫. . .索菲亚的妹妹. . .帮助诱捕我的犹太珠宝商. . .社会工作者. . .米德尔塞克斯县法庭的人. . .给我十年刑期的法官. . .我所认识过的囚犯、警卫和官员。
A celebrity among the Norfolk Prison Colony inmates was a rich, older fellow, a paralytic, calledJohn. He had killed his baby, one of those "mercy" killings. He was a proud, big-shot type, alwaysreminding everyone that he was a 33rd-degree Mason, and what powers Masons had-that onlyMasons ever had been U. S. Presidents, that Masons in distress could secretly signal to judgesand other Masons in powerful positions. 
在诺福克监狱殖民地的囚犯中，有一位名叫约翰的富有、年长的瘫子。他杀了自己的婴儿，是那些“仁慈”杀人案件之一。
I kept thinking about what Reginald had said. I wanted to test it with John. He worked in a soft jobin the prison's school. I went over there. 
我一直在想雷金纳德说的话。我想用约翰来测试一下。他在监狱的学校里做一份轻松的工作。我去了那里。
"John," I said, "how many degrees in a circle?" 
“约翰，”我说，“一个圆有多少度？”
He said, "Three hundred and sixty." 
他说：“三百六十度。”
I drew a square. "How many degrees in that?" He said three hundred and sixty. 
我画了一个正方形，“这个有多少度？”他说是三百六十度。
  I asked him was three hundred and sixty degrees, then, the maximum of degrees in anything? 
我问他，是不是三百六十度是任何事物的最大度数？
He said "Yes." 
他说：“是的。”
I said, "Well, why is it that Masons go only to thirty-three degrees?" 
我说：“那么，为什么共济会只达到
He had no satisfactory answer. But for me, the answer was that Masonry, actually, is only thirty- three degrees of the religion of Islam, which is the full projection, forever denied to Masons,although they know it exists. 
他没有满意的回答。但是对我来说，答案是共济会实际上是伊斯兰教的33度，这是完全的
Reginald, when he came to visit me again in a few days, could gauge from my attitude the effectthat his talking had had upon me . He seemed very pleased. Then, very seriously, he talked fortwo solid hours about "the devil white man" and "the brainwashed black man." 
几天后，雷金纳德再次来看我时，他可以从我的态度中判断出自己的话对我产生了什么影响。他似乎很高兴。然后，非常认真地讲了两个小时的“白人魔鬼”和“被洗脑的黑人”的问题。
When Reginald left, he left me rocking with some of the first serious thoughts I had ever had inmy life: that the white man was fast losing his power to oppress and exploit the dark world; thatthe dark world was starting to rise to rule the world again, as it had before; that the white man'sworld was on the way down, it was on the way out. 
当雷金纳德离开时，他让我开始思考一些我人生中第一次认真思考的问题：白人正在迅速失去压迫和剥削黑暗世界的力量；黑暗世界正在开始再次统治世界，就像以前一样；白人的世界正在下降，正在被淘汰。
"You don't even know who you are," Reginald had said. "You don't even know, the white devil hashidden it from you, that you are of a race of people of ancient civilizations, and riches in gold andkings. You don't even know your true family name, you wouldn't recognize your true language ifyou heard it. You have been cut off by the devil white man from all true knowledge of your ownkind. You have been a victim of the evil of the devil white man ever since he murdered and rapedand stole you from your native land in the seeds of your forefathers. . . ." 
“你甚至不知道自己是谁，”雷金纳德说。“你甚至不知道，白人魔鬼已经把你蒙在鼓里，让你不知道自己是一个古老文明种族的人，拥有丰富的黄金和国王。你甚至不知道自己的真姓大名，如果你听到它的话，你不会认出它的真正语言。你已经被白人魔鬼从所有自己种族的真正知识中切断了联系。自从他谋杀、强奸并从你的祖国偷走你时起，你就成为了白人魔鬼的受害者。 ”
  I began to receive at least two letters every day from my brothers and sisters in Detroit. Myoldest brother, Wilfred, wrote, and his first wife, Bertha, the mother of his two children (since herdeath, Wilfred has met and married his present wife, Ruth). Philbert wrote, and my sister Hilda.And Reginald visited, staying in Boston awhile before he went back to Detroit, where he had beenthe most recent of them to be converted. They were all Muslims, followers of a man theydescribed to me as "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad," a small, gentle man, whom theysometimes referred to as "The Messenger of Allah." He was, they said, "a black man, like us." Hehad been born in America on a farm in Georgia. He had moved with his family to Detroit, andthere had met a Mr. Wallace D. Fard who he claimed was "God in person." Mr. Wallace D. Fardhad given to Elijah Muhammad Allah's message for the black people who were "the Lost-FoundNation of Islam here in this wilderness of North America." 
我开始每天至少收到来自底特律的兄弟姐妹们的两封信。我最大的哥哥威尔弗雷德写信，他的第一任妻子伯莎（已故），是两个孩子的母亲（自她去世以来，威尔弗雷德已经见过并娶了他现在的妻子露丝）。菲利浦伯特写信，我的妹妹希尔达也写信。雷金纳德经常来看我，他会在波士顿停留一段时间，然后回到底特律，他是最近被转化的人之一。他们都是穆斯林，追随着一个人，他们向我描述为“尊敬的伊莱贾·穆罕默德”，一个温和的小个子男人，有时被称为“阿拉使者”。他们说，他“是一个黑人，和我们一样”。他出生在美国佐治亚州的农场上。他和全家搬到了底特律，在那里遇到了一位名叫华莱士·D·法德的先生，他自称是“上帝本人”。华莱士·D·法德向伊莱贾·穆罕默德传达了阿拉对黑人的信息，他们是“在北美荒野中的失落与发现的伊斯兰国家”。
All of them urged me to "accept the teachings of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad." Reginaldexplained that pork was not eaten by those who worshiped in the religion of Islam, and notsmoking cigarettes was a rule of the followers of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, because theydid not take injurious things such as narcotics, tobacco, or liquor into their bodies. Over and over,I read, and heard, "The key to a Muslim is submission, the attunement of one toward Allah." 
他们都敦促我“接受伊莱贾·穆罕默德的教导”。雷金纳德解释说，在伊斯兰教中，不吃猪肉是信徒必须遵守的规则，而且不抽烟也是伊莱贾·穆罕默德的追随者必须遵守的规则，因为他们不允许自己身体吸收有害的物质，如麻醉剂、烟草或酒精。我一遍又一遍地读着，听着：“穆斯林的关键是顺从，一个人与真主的联系。”
And what they termed "the true knowledge of the black man" that was possessed by the followersof The Honorable Elijah Muhammad was given shape for me in their lengthy letters, sometimescontaining printed literature. 
他们所谓的“黑人的真正知识”，是伊莱贾·穆罕默德的追随者所拥有的，在他们的长信中得到了体现，有时还包含印刷文学。
*     *     *
"The true knowledge," reconstructed much more briefly than I received it, was that history hadbeen "whitened" in the white man's history books, and thatthe black man had been "brainwashedfor hundreds of years." Original Man was black, in the continent called Africa where the humanrace had emerged on the planet Earth. 
“真正的知识”，比我听到的更简略地重建了它，历史在白人的历史书中被“漂白”了，黑人被“洗脑”了几百年。原始人类是黑人，在被称为非洲的大洲上，人类在这个星球上出现。
The black man, original man, built great empires and civilizations and cultures while the whiteman was still living on all fours in caves. "The devil white man," down through history, out of hisdevilish nature, had pillaged, murdered, raped, and exploited every race of man not white. 
黑人，原始人类，建立了伟大的帝国和文明和文化，而白人仍然生活在洞穴中。 “白人魔鬼”，纵观历史，出于他的恶魔本性，掠夺、谋杀、强奸和剥削了所有不是白人的种族。
Human history's greatest crime was the traffic in black flesh when the devil white man went intoAfrica and murdered and kidnapped to bring to the West in chains, in slave ships, millions ofblack men, women, and children, who were worked and beaten and tortured as slaves. 
人类历史上最大的罪行是在白人魔鬼进入非洲后贩卖黑人肉体。他谋杀和绑架了数百万黑人男女和孩子，将他们作为奴隶用锁链装在奴隶船上运往西方。这些黑人被奴役、殴打和折磨。
The devil white man cut these black people off from all knowledge of their own kind, and cut themoff from any knowledge of their own language, religion, and past culture, until the black man inAmerica was the earth's only race of people who had absolutely no knowledge of his true identity. 
白人魔鬼将这些黑人与他们自己的种族、语言、宗教和过去的文化知识隔绝开来，直到美国黑人成为地球上唯一完全没有意识到自己真正身份的人群。
In one generation, the black slave women in America had been raped by the slavemaster whiteman until there had begun to emerge a homemade, handmade, brainwashed race that was nolonger even of its true color, that no longer even knew its true family names. The slavemasterforced his family name upon this rape-mixed race, which the slavemaster began to call "theNegro." 
在一个世代的时间里，美国的黑人奴隶妇女被奴隶主白人强奸，直到开始出现一个自制的、手工的、被洗脑的种族，这个种族甚至不再拥有其真实颜色，不再知道自己的真实姓氏。奴隶主强迫他的姓氏加在这个被强奸混合的种族上，奴隶主开始称他们为“黑人”。
This "Negro" was taught of his native Africa that it was peopled by heathen, black savages,swinging like monkeys from trees. This "Negro" accepted this along with every other teaching ofthe slavemaster that was designed to make him accept and obey and worship the white man. 
这个“黑人”被教导他的故乡非洲是由异教徒、黑人野蛮人组成的，他们像猴子一样在树上摇摆。这个“黑人”接受了奴隶主的每一个其他教导，这些教导旨在使他接受和服从并崇拜白人。
And where the religion of every other people on earth taught its believers of aGod with whom theycould identify, a God who at least looked like one of their own kind, the slavemaster injected hisChristian religion into this "Negro." This "Negro" was taught to worship an alien God having thesame blond hair, pale skin, and blue eyes as the slavemaster. 
而地球上其他每个民族的宗教信仰都教导信徒们相信一个他们可以认同的神，至少看起来像是他们的同类，奴隶主将他的基督教信仰注入这个“黑人”中。这个“黑人”被教导崇拜一个拥有与奴隶主相同金发、苍白皮肤和蓝色眼睛的异教徒神。
This religion taught the "Negro" that black was a curse. It taught him to hate everything black,including himself. It taught him that everything white was good, to be admired, respected, andloved. It brainwashed this "Negro" to think he was superior if his complexion showed more of thewhite pollution of the slavemaster. This white man's Christian religion further deceived andbrainwashed this "Negro" to always turn the other cheek, and grin, and scrape, and bow, and behumble, and to sing, and to pray, and to take whatever was dished out by the devilish white man;and to look for his pie in the sky, and for his heaven in the hereafter, while right here on earth theslave-master white man enjoyed _his_ heaven. 
这种宗教教导“黑人”黑色是一种诅咒。它教导他憎恨所有黑色的东西，包括他自己。它教导他所有白色的东西都是好的、值得崇拜、尊敬和爱戴的。它对这位“黑人”进行了洗脑，使他认为自己如果肤色更加接近白人奴隶主的白色，就是更优越的。这个白人的基督教信仰进一步欺骗和洗脑了这个“黑人”，让他总是忍气吞声、傻笑、卑躬屈膝，唱歌祈祷，接受恶魔般的白人给他的一切；同时在地球上，这个奴隶主白人享受着他自己的“天堂”。
Many a time, I have looked back, trying to assess, just for myself, my first reactions to all this.Every instinct of the ghetto jungle streets, every hustling fox and criminal wolf instinct in me,which would have scoffed at and rejected anything else, was struck numb. It was as though all ofthat life merely was back there, without any remaining effect, or influence. I remember how, sometime later, reading the Bible in the Norfolk Prison Colony library, I came upon, then I read, overand over, how Paul on the road to Damascus, upon hearing the voice of Christ, was so smittenthat he was knocked off his horse, in a daze.  I do not now, and I did not then, liken myself to Paul.But I do understand his experience. 
很多次，我回顾过去，试图自己评估一下，我第一次对这一切的反应。贫民窟街道上的每一个本能，每一个狡猾的狐狸和犯罪狼人本能在我身上，这些都会对其他任何东西嗤之以鼻并拒绝，但现在都麻木了。就好像所有生命都只是回到了那里，没有任何剩余的影响或影响。我记得后来在诺福克监狱殖民地图书馆里阅读圣经时，我偶然看到了它，然后一遍又一遍地读着保罗在去大马士革的路上听到基督的声音后被击倒的情景，他感到困惑而晕倒在地上。我现在不知道，当时我也没有将自己比作保罗。但我确实理解了他的经历。
I have since learned-helping me to understand what then began to happen within me-that thetruth can be quickly received, or received at all, only by the sinner who knows and admits that heis guilty of having sinned much. Stated another way: only guilt admitted accepts truth. The Bibleagain: the one people whom Jesus could not help were the Pharisees; they didn't feel theyneeded any help. 
从那以后，我了解到（这帮助我理解当时发生在自己身上的事情），只有认识到自己犯了很多罪的罪人才能迅速接受真相，或者根本不接受真相。换一种说法：只有承认自己的罪行才能接受真相。《圣经》里也有类似的话：耶稣无法帮助的人是法利赛人，他们不觉得自己需要任何帮助。
The very enormity of my previous life's guilt prepared me to accept the truth. 
我以前生活中的巨大罪恶使我能够接受真相。
Not for weeks yet would I deal with the direct, personal application to myself, as a black man, ofthe truth. It still was like a blinding light. 
几个星期以来，我都没有直接面对这个真相，作为黑人，这个真相直接和个人地适用于我自己。它仍然像一道耀眼的光芒。
Reginald left Boston and went back to Detroit. I would sit in my room and stare. At the dining- room table, I would hardly eat, only drink the water. I nearly starved. Fellow inmates, concerned,and guards, apprehensive, asked what was wrong with me. It was suggested that I visit thedoctor, and I didn't. The doctor, advised, visited me. I don't know what his diagnosis was, probablythat I was working on some act. 
雷金纳德离开了波士顿，回到了底特律。我坐在房间里凝视着。在餐桌上，我几乎不吃，只喝水。我快饿死了。狱友和狱警都很关心我，问我出了什么问题。他们建议我去看一下医生，但我没有去。后来医生来看了我。我不知道他的诊断是什么，可能是我在表演某种行为。
I was going through the hardest thing, also the greatest thing, for any human being to do; toaccept that which is already within you, and around you. 
我正在经历着人类最困难、最伟大的事情，那就是接受那些已经存在于你内心和周围的一切。
I learned later that my brothers and sisters in Detroit put together the money for my sister Hilda tocome and visit me. She told me that when The Honorable Elijah Muhammad was in Detroit, hewould stay as a guest at my brother Wilfred's home, which was on McKay Street. Hilda kepturging me to write to Mr. Muhammad. He understood what it was to be in the white man's prison,she said, because he, himself, had not long before gotten out of the federal prison at Milan,Michigan, where he had served five years for evading the draft. 
后来我得知，我底特律的兄弟姐妹们筹集了一些钱，让我妹妹希尔达来探望我。她告诉我，当伊莱贾·穆罕默德阁下在底特律时，他会住在我哥哥威尔弗雷德家，地址是 McKay 街。希尔达一直鼓励我写信给穆罕默德先生。她说，因为他自己不久前刚刚从密歇根州米兰的联邦监狱里出来，他在那里服刑了五年，因为他逃避征兵。他说，他知道身陷白人监狱的感受是什么。
Hilda said that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad came to Detroit to reorganize his TempleNumber One, which had become disorganized during his prison time; but he lived in Chicago,where he was organizing and building his Temple Number Two.It was Hilda who said to me,"Would you like to hear how the white man came to this planet Earth?" 
希尔达说，伊莱贾·穆罕默德阁下来到底特律，重组他在监狱期间变得混乱的第一神庙；但他住在芝加哥，正在组织和建设他的第二神庙。是希尔达对我说：“你想听听白人是如何来到这个地球的吗？”
And she told me that key lesson of Mr. Elijah Muhammad's teachings, which I later learned wasthe demonology that every religion has, called "Yacub's History." Elijah Muhammad teaches hisfollowers that, first, the moon separated from the earth. Then, the first humans, Original Man,were a black people. They founded the Holy City Mecca. 
她告诉我，伊莱贾·穆罕默德阁下的教导中的关键课程，后来我了解到这是每个宗教都有的恶魔学，称为“雅各布的历史”。伊莱贾·穆罕默德教导他的追随者，首先，月亮从地球上分离出来。然后，最初的人类，原始人，是黑人。他们建立了神圣的城市麦加。
Among this black race were twenty-four wise scientists. One of the scientists, at odds with therest, created the especially strong black tribe of Shabazz, from which America's Negroes, so- called, descend. 
在这个黑人种族中，有24位聪明的科学家。其中一位科学家与其他人不同，创立了特别强大的黑人部落Shabazz，从这个部落中诞生了所谓的美国黑人。
About sixty-six hundred years ago, when seventy per cent of the people were satisfied, and thirtyper cent were dissatisfied, among the dissatisfied was born a "Mr. Yacub." He was born to createtrouble, to break the peace, and to kill. His head was unusually large. When he was four yearsold, he began school. At the age of eighteen, Yacub had finished all of his nation's colleges anduniversities. He was known as "the big-head scientist." Among many other things, he had learnedhow to breed races scientifically. 
大约六百六十年前，当百分之七十的人满意，百分之三十的人不满意时，不满中诞生了“雅各布先生”。他生来就是制造麻烦、破坏和平和杀戮。他的头非常大。四岁时，他开始上学。十八岁时，雅各布完成了全国所有大学和学院的课程。他被称为“大头科学家”。除了其他许多事情，他还学会了如何科学地繁殖种族。
This big-head scientist, Mr. Yacub, began preaching in the streets of Mecca, making such hosts ofconverts that the authorities, increasingly concerned, finally exiled him with 59, 999 followers tothe island of Patmos-described in the Bible as the island where John received the messagecontained in Revelations in the New Testament. 
这位大头科学家，雅各布先生，开始在麦加的街道上传教，吸引了如此多的信徒，以至于当局越来越担心，最终将他和他的59,999名追随者放逐到了帕特莫斯岛（在圣经中被称为约翰接受包含在新约启示录中的信息的岛屿）。
Though he was a black man, Mr. Yacub, embittered toward Allah now, decided, as revenge, tocreate upon the earth a devil race-a bleached-out, white race of people. 
虽然雅各布先生是一个黑人，但他现在对安拉心存怨恨，他决定作为报复，在地球上创造一个魔鬼种族——一个漂白的、白种人的种族。
 From his studies, the big-head scientist knew that black men contained two germs, black andbrown. He knew that the brown germ stayed dormant as, being the lighter of the two germs, itwas the weaker. Mr. Yacub, to upset the law of nature, conceived the idea of employing what wetoday know as the recessive genes structure, to separate from each other the two germs, blackand brown, and then grafting the brown germ to progressively lighter, weaker stages. Thehumans resulting, he knew, would be, as they became lighter, and weaker, progressively alsomore susceptible to wickedness and evil. And in this way finally he would achieve the intendedbleached-out white race of devils. 
通过他的研究，这位大头科学家知道黑人包含两种细菌，黑色和棕色。他知道棕色细菌处于休眠状态，因为它是两种细菌中较轻的一种，所以比较弱。雅各布先生为了打破自然规律，构想出了一种我们今天称之为隐性基因结构的想法，将黑色和棕色两种细菌分离开来，然后将棕色细菌嫁接到越来越轻、越来越弱的阶段上。他知道，由此产生的人类会随着他们变得更加轻盈和虚弱而逐渐变得更加容易受到邪恶和罪恶的影响。这样他最终就能够实现他所期望的漂白白种人的魔鬼种族了。
He knew that it would take him several total color-change stages to get from black to white. Mr.Yacub began his work by setting up a eugenics law on the island of Patmos. 
他知道，从黑色到白色的转变需要经历多个完全的色变阶段。雅各布先生在帕特莫斯岛上开始了他的工作，制定了一项优生学法律。
Among Mr. Yacub's 59, 999 all-black followers, every third or so child that was born would showsome trace of brown. As these became adult, only brown and brown, or black and brown, werepermitted to marry. As their children were born, Mr. Yacub's law dictated that, if a black child, theattending nurse, or midwife, should stick a needle into its brain and give the body to cremators.The mothers were told it had been an "angel baby," which had gone to heaven, to prepare a placefor her. 
在雅各布先生的59,999名全黑人追随者中，每三个孩子出生就会有一些棕色痕迹。随着这些成年人的成年，只有棕色和棕色，或黑色和棕色才被允许结婚。当他们的孩子出生时，雅各布先生的法律规定，如果是一个黑人孩子，那么在场的护士或助产士应该将针头插入其大脑并让身体被火化。母亲们被告知这是一个“天使宝宝”，已经去了天堂，为她准备了一个地方。
But a brown child's mother was told to take very good care of it. 
但是，一个棕色孩子的母亲的告知要很好地照顾它。
Others, assistants, were trained by Mr. Yacub to continue his objective. Mr. Yacub, when he diedon the island at the age of one hundred and fifty-two, had left laws, and rules, for them to follow.According to the teachings of Mr. Elijah Muhammad, Mr. Yacub, except in his mind, never saw thebleached-out devil race that his procedures and laws and rules created. 
其他人，助手，由雅各布先生训练，继续他的目标。雅各布先生在岛上去世时享年152岁，留下了法律和规则供他们遵守。根据伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生的教学，除了在他的头脑中，雅各布先生从未看到过他的程序、法律和规则所创造的漂白白种人的魔鬼种族。
A two-hundred-year span was needed to eliminate on the island of Patmos allof the black people- until only brown people remained. 
在帕特莫斯岛上，需要两个世纪的时间才能消灭所有黑人，直到只剩下棕色人种。
The next two hundred years were needed to create from the brown race the red race-with nomore browns left on the island. 
接下来的两个世纪需要从棕色人种中创造出红色人种，在岛上没有更多的棕色人种留下。
In another two hundred years, from the red race was created the yellow race. 
再过两个世纪，从红色人种中创造出黄色人种。
Two hundred years later-the white race had at last been created. 
两百年后，白色人种终于被创造了。
On the island of Patmos was nothing but these blond, pale-skinned, cold-blue-eyed devils- savages, nude and shameless; hairy, like animals, they walked on all fours and they lived intrees. 
帕特莫斯岛上只有这些金发、白皙、冰冷的蓝眼睛的魔鬼——野人，他们裸体无羞无耻；像动物一样长着毛发，四肢着地行走，住在树屋里。
Six hundred more years passed before this race of people returned to the mainland, among thenatural black people. 
再过六百年，这个种族的人才回到大陆，与自然黑人相处。
Mr. Elijah Muhammad teaches his followers that within six months' time, through telling lies thatset the black men fighting among each other, this devil race had turned what had been a peacefulheaven on earth into a hell torn by quarreling and fighting. 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生教导他的追随者们，在六个月的时间里，通过撒谎让黑人互相斗争，这个魔鬼种族已经把原本和平的地球变成了一个由争吵和战斗撕裂的地狱。
But finally the original black people recognized that their sudden troubles stemmed from this devilwhite race that Mr. Yacub had made. They rounded them up, put them in chains. With little apronsto cover their nakedness, this devil race was marched off across the Arabian desert to the cavesof Europe. 
但是最终，最初的黑人意识到他们的突然麻烦来自于雅各布先生创造的这个魔鬼白色种族。他们围捕了他们，把他们锁在链子上。几乎没有内裤来遮盖他们的裸体，这个魔鬼种族被带到了穿过阿拉伯沙漠到欧洲洞穴的行军中。
The lambskin and the cable-tow used in Masonry today are symbolic of how the nakedness of thewhite man was covered when he was chained and driven across the hot sand. 
今天在梅森（共济会）中使用的羔羊皮和电缆索是对白人被锁
Mr. Elijah Muhammad further teaches that the white devil race in Europe'scaves was savage. Theanimals tried to kill him. He climbed trees outside his cave, made clubs, trying to protect his familyfrom the wild beasts outside trying to get in. 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生进一步教导他的追随者，欧洲的白人魔鬼种族中的奴隶是野蛮的。动物试图杀死他。他爬出洞穴外的树木，制作木棍，试图保护他的家人免受外面的野兽攻击并试图进入洞穴。
When this devil race had spent two thousand years in the caves, Allah raised up Moses to civilizethem, and bring them out of the caves. It was written that this devil white race would rule theworld for six thousand years. 
当这个魔鬼种族在洞穴中度过了两千年，真主提拔摩西来文明他们，并把他们带出洞穴。经书上写着这个白色魔鬼种族将统治世界六千年。
The Books of Moses are missing. That's why it is not known that he was in the caves. 
摩西的书不见了，这就是为什么没有人知道他是否在洞穴里。
When Moses arrived, the first of these devils to accept his teachings, the first he led out, werethose we call today the Jews. 
当摩西到达时，第一个接受他的教导、第一个被他领导的魔鬼种族是我们今天所称的犹太人。
According to the teachings of this "Yacub's History," when the Bible says "Moses lifted up theserpent in the wilderness," that serpent is symbolic of the devil white race Moses lifted up out ofthe caves of Europe, teaching them civilization. 
根据这个“雅各布的历史”的教导，当圣经中说“摩西在荒野上举起了这些蛇”，那条蛇是象征性地代表了摩西从欧洲洞穴中抬起来的白色魔鬼种族，教导他们文明。
It was written that after Yacub's bleached white race had ruled the world for six thousand years- down to our time-the black original race would give birth to one whose wisdom, knowledge, andpower would be infinite. 
经书中写道，在雅各布的漂白白色种族统治世界六千年之后，到我们这个时代，黑色原始种族将会产生一个拥有无限智慧、知识和力量的人。
It was written that some of the original black people should be brought as slaves to NorthAmerica-to learn to better understand, at first hand, the white devil's true nature, in modem times. 
经书中写道，应该将一些原始黑人作为奴隶带到北美洲，以在现代时代更好地了解白人魔鬼的真实本质。
Elijah Muhammad teaches that the greatest and mightiest God who appeared on the earth wasMaster W. D. Fard. He came from the East to the West, appearing in North America at a timewhen the history and the prophecy that is written was coming to realization, as the non-whitepeople all over the worldbegan to rise, and as the devil white civilization, condemned by Allah,was, through its devilish nature, destroying itself. 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德教导他的追随者，在地球上出现的最伟大的、最强大的上帝是W.D.法德大师。他从东方来到西方，出现在北美洲的时候，当时的历史和被书写的预言正在成为现实，因为全世界非白人开始崛起，而受到真主谴责的白色魔鬼文明因其邪恶的本质而摧毁自己。
Master W. D. Fard was half black and half white. He was made in this way to enable him to beaccepted by the black people in America, and to lead them, while at the same time he wasenabled to move undiscovered among the white people, so that he could understand and judgethe enemy of the blacks. 
W.D.法德大师是黑人和白人的混血儿。他被创造成这样，是为了让他被美洲的黑人所接受，并带领他们，同时也能够不被白人发现地在他们中间移动，以便他能够理解和判断黑人的敌人。
Master W. D. Fard, in 1931, posing as a seller of silks, met, in Detroit, Michigan, ElijahMuhammad. Master W. D. Fard gave to Elijah Muhammad Allah's message, and Allah's divineguidance, to save the Lost-Found Nation of Islam, the so-called Negroes, here in "this wildernessof North America." 
W.D.法德大师于1931年假扮成卖丝绸的商人，在密歇根州底特律市与伊莱贾·穆罕默德相遇。 W.D.法德大师向伊莱贾·穆罕默德传达了真主的信息和神圣的指引，以拯救这片北美洲的“荒野”中的迷失的国家伊斯兰，也就是所谓的黑人。
When my sister, Hilda, had finished telling me this "Yacub's History," she left. I don't know if I wasable to open my mouth and say good-bye. 
当我的妹妹希尔达告诉我这个“雅各布的历史”时，她离开了。我不知道我是否能够开口说再见。
I was to learn later that Elijah Muhammad's tales, like this one of "Yacub," infuriated the Muslimsof the East. While at Mecca, I reminded them that it was their fault, since they themselves hadn'tdone enough to make real Islam known in the West. Their silence left a vacuum into which anyreligious faker could step and mislead our people. 
我后来得知，伊莱贾·穆罕默德的故事，像这个“雅各布”的故事一样，激怒了东方的穆斯林。在麦加时，我提醒他们，这是他们的错，因为他们自己没有做足够的努力让真正的伊斯兰教在西方得到认可。他们的沉默留下了一个真空，任何宗教骗子都可以进入并误导我们的人民。
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
第十一章
SAVED 
拯救
I did write to Elijah Muhammad. He lived in Chicago at that time, at 6116 South Michigan Avenue.At least twenty-five times I must have written that first one-page letter to him, over and over. I wastrying to make it both legible and understandable. I practically couldn't read my handwritingmyself; itshames even to remember it. My spelling and my grammar were as bad, if not worse.Anyway, as well as I could express it, I said I had been told about him by my brothers and sisters,and I apologized for my poor letter. 
我确实给伊莱贾·穆罕默德写过信。他当时住在芝加哥，地址是南密歇根大道6116号。我至少写了25封这样的长信，每次都是一页纸，反复写。我试图让它既清晰又易懂。我自己几乎看不懂我的字迹，甚至连自己的名字都不记得了。我的拼写和语法也很糟糕，甚至更糟。无论如何，我用我能表达的方式说，我是听兄弟姐妹们说起他的，为我的拙劣的信道歉。
Mr. Muhammad sent me a typed reply. It had an all but electrical effect upon me to see thesignature of the "Messenger of Allah." After he welcomed me into the "true knowledge," he gaveme something to think about. The black prisoner, he said, symbolized white society's crime ofkeeping black men oppressed and deprived and ignorant, and unable to get decent jobs, turningthem into criminals. 
穆罕默德先生给我寄来了一封打字回复。看到“真主使者”的签名时，我几乎感到电击般的震撼。在欢迎我进入“真知识”之后，他给了我一些思考的东西。他说，黑人囚犯象征着白人社会将黑人男性压迫、剥夺、无知并使他们无法获得体面工作，从而将他们变成罪犯的罪行。
He told me to have courage. He even enclosed some money for me, a five-dollar bill. Mr.Muhammad sends money all over the country to prison inmates who write to him, probably to thisday. 
他告诉我要勇敢。他还附上了一些钱给我，一张五美元的钞票。穆罕默德先生向全国各地的监狱囚犯发送钱款，他们写信给他，可能直到今天都是这样。
Regularly my family wrote to me, "Turn to Allah . . . pray to the East." 
我的家人经常写信对我说：“向安拉求助……向东方祈祷。”
The hardest test I ever faced in my life was praying. You understand. My comprehending, mybelieving the teachings of Mr. Muhammad had only required my mind's saying to me, "That'sright!" or "I never thought of that." 
我一生中面对的最难的考验就是祈祷。你明白的。我的理解和信仰穆罕默德先生的教导只要求我的思想对我说，“那是对的！”或者“我从没想到过。”
But bending my knees to pray-that _act_-well, that took me a week. 
但是，跪下来祈祷这个动作——嗯，这个动作花了我一个星期才学会。
You know what my life had been. Picking a lock to rob someone's house was the only way myknees had ever been bent before. 
你知道我的生活是怎样的。撬锁抢劫别人的房子是我膝盖弯曲的唯一方式。
I had to force myself to bend my knees. And waves of shame and embarrassment would force meback up. 
我不得不强迫自己屈膝跪下。而羞愧和尴尬的浪潮会迫使我重新站起来。
For evil to bend its knees, admitting its guilt, to implore the forgiveness of God, is the hardestthing in the world. It's easy for me to see and to say thatnow. But then, when I was thepersonification of evil, I was going through it. Again, again, I would force myself back down intothe praying-to-Allah posture. When finally I was able to make myself stay down-I didn't know whatto say to Allah. 
对于邪恶屈服承认自己的罪行，恳求上帝的宽恕是世上最困难的事情。我现在很容易看到和说出来这一点。但是那时，当我是邪恶化身的时候，我正在经历这一切。我一次又一次地强迫自己回到向安拉祈祷的姿势。最终，当我真的能够让自己跪下时——我不知道要对安拉说什么。
For the next years, I was the nearest thing to a hermit in the Norfolk Prison Colony. I never havebeen more busy in my life. I still marvel at how swiftly my previous life's thinking pattern slid awayfrom me, like snow off a roof. It is as though someone else I knew of had lived by hustling andcrime. I would be startled to catch myself thinking in a remote way of my earlier self as anotherperson. 
在接下来的几年里，我在诺福克监狱殖民地过着隐士般的生活。我一生中从未如此忙碌过。我仍然惊叹于我的过去生活的思维模式如何迅速地从我身边溜走，就像从屋顶上的雪一样。就好像我知道的另一个人一直靠欺骗和犯罪为生。当我发现自己以另一种方式思考我的早期自我时，我会感到很惊讶。
The things I felt, I was pitifully unable to express in the one-page letter that went every day to Mr.Elijah Muhammad. And I wrote at least one more daily letter, replying to one of my brothers andsisters. Every letter I received from them added something to my knowledge of the teachings ofMr. Muhammad. I would sit for long periods and study his photographs. 
我感受到的东西，我可悲地无法在每天寄给伊莱贾·穆罕默德的一封页信中表达出来。我还写了至少另外一封每日回信，回复我的一个兄弟姐妹。我从他们那里收到的每封信都为我提供了更多关于穆罕默德先生教义的知识。我会坐很长时间，研究他的照片。
I've never been one for inaction. Everything I've ever felt strongly about, I've done somethingabout. I guess that's why, unable to do anything else, I soon began writing to people I had knownin the hustling world, such as Sammy the Pimp, John Hughes, the gambling-house owner, thethief Jumpsteady, and several dope peddlers. I wrote them all about Allah and Islam and Mr.Elijah Muhammad. I had no idea where most of them lived. I addressed their letters in care of theHarlem or Roxbury bars and clubs where I'd known them. 
我从来不是一个不采取行动的人。我所强烈感受到的每件事情，我都采取了一些行动。我想这就是为什么，由于无法做其他事情，我很快开始写信给我在诈骗世界中认识的人，比如Sammy the Pimp（皮条客山姆）、John Hughes（约翰·休斯）、赌馆老板、小偷Jumpsteady和几个毒贩。我给他们写了关于安拉和伊斯兰教以及伊莱贾·穆罕默德的事情。我不知道他们大多数人住在哪里。我把信寄到我在哈莱姆或罗克斯伯里酒吧和俱乐部认识的他们那里。
I never got a single reply. The average hustler and criminal was too uneducated to write a letter. Ihave known many slick, sharp-looking hustlers, who would have you think they had an interest inWall Street; privately, they would get someone else to read a letter if they received one. Besides,neither would Ihave replied to anyone writing me something as wild as "the white man is thedevil." 
我从来没有收到过一封回信。平均而言，诈骗者和罪犯都太没有文化了，不会写信。我认识很多狡猾、外表精明的诈骗者，他们会让你认为他们对华尔街有兴趣；私下里，如果他们收到一封信，他们会让别人来读它。此外，我也不会回复任何人写给我的东西，比如“白人是魔鬼”。
What certainly went on the Harlem and Roxbury wires was that Detroit Red was going crazy instir, or else he was trying some hype to shake up the warden's office. 
哈莱姆和罗克斯伯里的消息肯定是，底特律红衣军正在发疯似的煽动，或者他试图通过一些炒作来动摇狱长办公室。
During the years that I stayed in the Norfolk Prison Colony, never did any official directly sayanything to me about those letters, although, of course, they all passed through the prisoncensorship. I'm sure, however, they monitored what I wrote to add to the files which every stateand federal prison keeps on the conversion of Negro inmates by the teachings of Mr. ElijahMuhammad. 
在我住在诺福克监狱殖民地的那些年里，从来没有任何官员直接对我说过这些信，当然，它们都通过了监狱审查。然而，我敢肯定，他们监视了我写的内容，以添加到每个州和联邦监狱的档案中，这些档案记录了以利亚·穆罕默德先生的教义使黑人囚犯皈依。
But at that time, I felt that the real reason was that the white man knew that he was the devil. 
但是那时，我觉得真正的原因是因为白人知道他是魔鬼。
Later on, I even wrote to the Mayor of Boston, to the Governor of Massachusetts, and to Harry STruman. They never answered; they probably never even saw my letters. I hand-scratched tothem how the white man's society was responsible for the black man's condition in this wildernessof North America. 
后来，我甚至写信给波士顿市长、马萨诸塞州州长和哈里·杜鲁门。他们没有回复，也许他们甚至没有看到我的信。我手写了一封信给他们，说明白人社会应该对北美洲这片荒野上黑人的状况负责。
It was because of my letters that I happened to stumble upon starting to acquire some kind of ahomemade education. 
正是因为我的信件，我偶然开始获得了一些自制教育。
I became increasingly frustrated at not being able to express what I wanted to convey in lettersthat I wrote, especially those to Mr. Elijah Muhammad. In the street, I had been the mostarticulate hustler out there-I had commanded attention when I said something. But now, trying towrite simple English, I not only wasn't articulate, I wasn't even functional. How would I soundwriting in slang, the way I would say it, something such as, "Look, daddy, let me pull your coatabout a cat, Elijah Muhammad-"Many who today hear me somewhere in person, or on television, or those who read somethingI've said, will think I went to school far beyond the eighth grade. This impression is due entirely tomy prison studies. 
我越来越沮丧，因为我无法用我写的信表达我想传达的东西，特别是那些写给伊莱贾·穆罕默德的信。在街头，我曾经是那里最有说服力的骗子——当我说话时，我能够吸引别人的注意力。但现在，尝试写简单的英语，我不仅不流利，甚至不起作用。如果我用俚语写作，比如“听着，爸爸，让我把你的外套拉上，关于一个猫的事情，伊莱贾·穆罕默德——”许多人今天在现实生活中听到我，或者在电视上看到我，或者读到我说的话，都会认为我上的是远远超出八年级水平的学校。这种印象完全归功于我在监狱的学习。
It had really begun back in the Charlestown Prison, when Bimbi first made me feel envy of hisstock of knowledge. Bimbi had always taken charge of any conversation he was in, and I hadtried to emulate him. But every book I picked up had few sentences which didn't containanywhere from one to nearly all of the words that might as well have been in Chinese. When I justskipped those words, of course, I really ended up with little idea of what the book said. So I hadcome to the Norfolk Prison Colony still going through only book-reading motions. Pretty soon, Iwould have quit even these motions, unless I had received the motivation that I did. 
这真正开始于查尔斯敦监狱，当比姆第一次让我感到羡慕他的知识储备时。比姆总是在谈话中占据主导地位，我也试图模仿他。但是，我拿起的每一本书都很少有几句话不包含可能就像中文一样的所有单词。当然，当我跳过这些单词时，我真的不知道这本书在说什么。所以我来到诺福克监狱殖民地，仍在通过阅读书籍来学习。很快，我将放弃这些动作，除非我得到我所做的动力。
I saw that the best thing I could do was get hold of a dictionary-to study, to learn some words. Iwas lucky enough to reason also that I should try to improve my penmanship. It was sad. Icouldn't even write in a straight line. It was both ideas together that moved me to request adictionary along with some tablets and pencils from the Norfolk Prison Colony school. 
我知道我能做的最好的事情就是拿到一本字典——用来学习，学习一些单词。我很幸运地想到我应该尝试改善我的书法。这很可悲。我甚至不能写直线。这两个想法一起促使我向诺福克监狱殖民地学校请求一本词典、一些写字板和铅笔。
I spent two days just riffling uncertainly through the dictionary's pages. I'd never realized so manywords existed! I didn't know _which_ words I needed to learn. Finally, just to start some kind ofaction, I began copying. 
我花了两天时间犹豫地翻阅字典的页面。我从没想过有这么多单词存在！我不知道需要学习哪些单词。最后，为了开始某种行动，我开始复制。
In my slow, painstaking, ragged handwriting, I copied into my tablet everything printed on that firstpage, down to the punctuation marks. 
在我缓慢、费力、潦草的手写中，我把第一页上的所有印刷文字都抄到了我的写字板上，包括标点符号。
I believe it took me a day. Then, aloud, I read back, to myself, everything I'd written on the tablet.Over and over, aloud, to myself, I read my own handwriting.I woke up the next morning, thinking about those words-immensely proud to realize that not onlyhad I written so much at one time, but I'd written words that I never knew were in the world.Moreover, with a little effort, I also could remember what many of these words meant. I reviewedthe words whose meanings I didn't remember. Funny thing, from the dictionary first page rightnow, that "aardvark" springs to my mind. The dictionary had a picture of it, a long-tailed, long- eared, burrowing African mammal, which lives off termites caught by sticking out its tongue as ananteater does for ants. 
我相信我花了一天的时间。然后，大声地，我读回我自己在写字板上写的所有内容。一遍又一遍地，大声地，我读着自己的笔迹。第二天早上醒来，我想起了那些单词——感到非常自豪地意识到，我不仅一次性写了那么多文字，而且我还写下了我从未知道存在的单词。此外，通过一点努力，我也能记住这些单词的意思。我回顾了一下那些我不知道意思的单词。有趣的是，现在从字典的第一页开始，“aardvark”（土豚）就浮现在我的脑海中。字典里有一张它的照片，一种长尾巴、长耳朵、挖洞的非洲哺乳动物，它以蚂蚁为食，伸出舌头捕捉蚂蚁。
I was so fascinated that I went on-I copied the dictionary's next page. And the same experiencecame when I studied that. With every succeeding page, I also learned of people and places andevents from history. Actually the dictionary is like a miniature encyclopedia. Finally the dictionary'sA section had filled a whole tablet-and I went on into the B's. That was the way I started copyingwhat eventually became the entire dictionary. It went a lot faster after so much practice helped meto pick up handwriting speed. Between what I wrote in my tablet, and writing letters, during therest of my time in prison I would guess I wrote a million words. 
我非常着迷，继续抄写——我抄写了字典的下一页。当我学习时也有同样的感觉。随着每一页的成功，我也了解了历史上的人物、地点和事件。实际上，字典就像一本微型百科全书。最后，字典的A部分已经填满了整个平板电脑，我继续进入B部分。这就是我开始复制最终成为整个字典的方式。经过大量的练习帮助我提高手写速度，这要快得多。在我狱中剩余的时间里，我估计我在写字板上写下的文字和写信加起来有一百万个单词。
I suppose it was inevitable that as my word-base broadened, I could for the first time pick up abook and read and now begin to understand what the book was saying. Anyone who has read agreat deal can imagine the new world that opened. Let me tell you something: from then until I leftthat prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading on mybunk. You couldn't have gotten me out of books with a wedge. Between Mr. Muhammad'steachings, my correspondence, my visitors-usually Ella and Reginald-and my reading of books,months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I never hadbeen so truly free in my life. 
我想，随着我的词汇量不断扩大，不可避免地，我第一次拿起一本书开始阅读，并开始理解书中的内容。任何读过大量书籍的人都可以想象出这个新世界所打开的门户。让我告诉你一些事情：从那时起直到我离开监狱，每当我有空闲时间时，如果我不在图书馆里读书，我就在我的床上读书。你不可能用楔子把我从书本中解救出来。在穆罕默德先生的教导、我的书信、我的访客（通常是艾拉和雷金纳德）以及我阅读的书籍之间，几个月的时间不知不觉就过去了，我甚至没有考虑过自己被监禁的事情。事实上，在那之前，我从来没有在生活中如此真正地自由过。
The Norfolk Prison Colony's library was in the school building. A variety ofclasses was taughtthere by instructors who came from such places as Harvard and Boston universities. The weeklydebates between inmate teams were also held in the school building. You would be astonished toknow how worked up convict debaters and audiences would get over subjects like "ShouldBabies Be Fed Milk?" 
诺福克监狱殖民地的图书馆在教学楼里。来自哈佛大学和波士顿大学等地方的教师在那里教授各种课程。囚犯团队之间的每周辩论也会在学校的教学楼里举行。你会惊讶地发现，对于像“婴儿应该喝牛奶吗？”这样的主题，囚犯辩论者和观众会变得多么激烈。
Available on the prison library's shelves were books on just about every general subject. Much ofthe big private collection that Parkhurst had willed to the prison was still in crates and boxes in theback of the library-thousands of old books. Some of them looked ancient: covers faded, old-timeparchment-looking binding. Parkhurst, I've mentioned, seemed to have been principally interestedin history and religion. He had the money and the special interest to have a lot of books that youwouldn't have in general circulation. Any college library would have been lucky to get thatcollection. 
监狱图书馆的书架上摆满了各种各样的书籍，涵盖了几乎所有的一般学科。帕克赫斯特留给监狱的大部分私人藏书仍被装在箱子里，放在图书馆后面的架子上——数千本旧书。其中一些看起来非常古老：封面褪色，古老的羊皮纸般装订。正如我提到的，帕克赫斯特似乎主要对历史和宗教感兴趣。他有财力和特殊兴趣，拥有大量的书籍，这些书籍通常不会在普通流通范围内。任何大学图书馆都会很幸运地获得这样的收藏。
As you can imagine, especially in a prison where there was heavy emphasis on rehabilitation, aninmate was smiled upon if he demonstrated an unusually intense interest in books. There was asizable number of well-read inmates, especially the popular debaters. Some were said by manyto be practically walking encyclopedias. They were almost celebrities. No university would askany student to devour literature as I did when this new world opened to me, of being able to readand _understand_. 
正如你所能想象的，特别是在一个强调康复的监狱里，如果一个囚犯表现出对书籍异常浓厚的兴趣，他会受到重视。有很多阅读广泛的囚犯，尤其是那些受欢迎的辩论者。有些人被许多人称为实际上的行走百科全书。他们几乎是名人。没有大学会要求任何学生像我在这个世界向我敞开时那样大量地阅读和理解文学。
I read more in my room than in the library itself. An inmate who was known to read a lot couldcheck out more than the permitted maximum number of books. I preferred reading in the totalisolation of my own room. 
我在房间里读的书比在图书馆里还多。一个被认为读书很多的囚犯可以借阅超过允许的最大数量的书籍。我更喜欢在我的房间完全孤立的情况下阅读。
When I had progressed to really serious reading, every night at about ten P. M. I would beoutraged with the "lights out." It always seemed to catch me right in the middle of somethingengrossing. 
当我开始真正认真地阅读时，每天晚上大约晚上10点，我都会被“熄灯”声吵醒。它总是似乎在我全神贯注于一些有趣的事情的时候抓住我。
 Fortunately, right outside my door was a corridor light that cast a glow into my room. The glowwas enough to read by, once my eyes adjusted to it. So when "lights out" came, I would sit on thefloor where I could continue reading in that glow. 
幸运的是，我门外的走廊灯会投射出一道光进入我的房间。一旦我的眼睛适应了这种光线，这种光线就足够我读书了。所以当“熄灯”声响起时，我会坐在地板上，在那里我可以继续在这种光线下阅读。
At one-hour intervals the night guards paced past every room. Each time I heard the approachingfootsteps, I jumped into bed and feigned sleep. And as soon as the guard passed, I got back outof bed onto the floor area of that light-glow, where I would read for another fifty-eight minutes-untilthe guard approached again. That went on until three or four every morning. Three or four hoursof sleep a night was enough for me. Often in the years in the streets I had slept less than that. 
夜间警卫每隔一小时就会从每个房间经过。每次我听到靠近的脚步声，我都会跳进床上假装睡觉。一旦警卫走过去，我就会立刻起床，走到那道光照射的区域继续阅读，直到下一次警卫过来。这种情况一直持续到每天早上三、四点钟。每晚三、四个小时的睡眠对我来说已经足够了。在街头度过的那些年里，我经常比这睡得更久。

The teachings of Mr. Muhammad stressed how history had been "whitened"-when white men hadwritten history books, the black man simply had been left out. Mr. Muhammad couldn't have saidanything that would have struck me much harder. I had never forgotten how when my class, meand all of those whites, had studied seventh-grade United States history back in Mason, thehistory of the Negro had been covered in one paragraph, and the teacher had gotten a big laughwith his joke , "Negroes' feet are so big that when they walk, they leave a hole in the ground." 
穆罕默德先生的教导强调了历史如何被“漂白” - 当白人撰写历史书籍时，黑人只是被忽略了。穆罕默德先生不可能说任何更让我震惊的话。我从未忘记当我的班级，以及所有白人，在梅森学习七年级美国历史时，黑人的历史只用了一段落来涵盖，老师得到了一个大笑，他的玩笑是， “黑人的脚非常大，以至于当他们走路时，他们在地面上留下了一个洞。”
This is one reason why Mr. Muhammad's teachings spread so swiftly all over the United States,among _all_ Negroes, whether or not they became followers of Mr. Muhammad. The teachingsring true-to every Negro. You can hardly show me a black adult in America-or a white one, for thatmatter-who knows from the history books anything like the truth about the black man's role. In myown case, once I heard of the "glorious history of the black man," I took special painsto hunt inthe library for books that would inform me on details about black history. 
这是穆罕默德先生的教导如此迅速传播到全美国，在所有的黑人中传播的原因之一，无论他们是否成为穆罕默德先生的粉丝。这些教导对于每个黑人都是真实的。在美国，你几乎不可能找到一个成年人是黑人或白人，他们不知道历史书上关于黑人角色的真相。就我而言，一旦我听说了“黑人的辉煌历史”，我就特别努力地在图书馆里寻找书籍，以了解有关黑人历史的详细信息。
I can remember accurately the very first set of books that really impressed me. I have sincebought that set of books and have it at home for my children to read as they grow up. It's called_Wonders of the World_. It's full of pictures of archaeological finds, statues that depict, usually,non-European people. 
我准确地记得第一套真正打动我的书籍。从那以后，我就买下了这套书，放在家里供我的孩子长大后阅读。它被称为《世界奇观》。书中充满了考古发现的图片和描绘通常非欧洲人的雕像。
I found books like Will Durant's _Story of Civilization_. I read H. G. Wells' _Outline of History_._Souls Of Black Folk_ by W. E. B. Du Bois gave me a glimpse into the black people's historybefore they came to this country. Carter G. Woodson's _Negro History_ opened my eyes aboutblack empires before the black slave was brought to the United States, and the early Negrostruggles for freedom. 
我找到了像威尔·杜兰特的《文明的故事》这样的书籍。我读了H.G.韦尔斯的《历史大纲》。W.E.B.杜波依斯的《黑人的灵魂》让我一窥黑人来到这个国家之前的历史。卡特·G·伍德逊的《黑人历史》让我了解到黑人奴隶被带到美国之前黑人帝国的存在，以及早期黑人为争取自由而进行的斗争。
J. A. Rogers' three volumes of _Sex and Race_ told about race-mixing before Christ's time; aboutAesop being a black man who told fables; about Egypt's Pharaohs; about the great CopticChristian Empires; about Ethiopia, the earth's oldest continuous black civilization, as China is theoldest continuous civilization. 
J.A.罗杰斯的三卷《性和种族》讲述了基督前的时代中的种族混合；伊索是一个讲述寓言故事的黑人；埃及法老；伟大的科普特基督教帝国；埃塞俄比亚，地球上最古老的连续黑色文明，与中国是最早的连续文明一样。
Mr. Muhammad's teaching about how the white man had been created led me to _Findings InGenetics_ by Gregor Mendel. (The dictionary's G section was where I had learned what"genetics" meant. ) I really studied this book by the Austrian monk. Reading it over and over,especially certain sections, helped me to understand that if you started with a black man, a whiteman could be produced; but starting with a white man, you never could produce a black man- because the white gene is recessive. And since no one disputes that there was but one OriginalMan, the conclusion is clear. 
穆罕默德先生教导了白人是如何被创造的，这引导我阅读了格雷戈尔·门德尔的《基因发现》。（在这本字典的G部分，我学到了“遗传学”的意思。）我真的研究了这个奥地利修道士的书。反复阅读它，特别是某些章节，帮助我理解如果你从一个黑人开始，你可以生出一个白人；但是从一个白人开始，你永远不可能生出一个黑人 - 因为白人基因是隐性的。既然没有人质疑只有一个原始人，那么结论就是明确的。
During the last year or so, in the _New York Times_, Arnold Toynbee used theword "bleached" indescribing the white man. (His words were: "White (i.e. bleached) human beings of NorthEuropean origin. . . .") Toynbee also referred to the European geographic area as only apeninsula of Asia. He said there is no such thing as Europe. And if you look at the globe, you willsee for yourself that America is only an extension of Asia. (But at the same time Toynbee isamong those who have helped to bleach history. He has written that Africa was the only continentthat produced no history. He won't write that again. Every day now, the truth is coming to light. ) 
在过去的一年左右，在《纽约时报》上，阿诺德·汤因比使用了“漂白”一词来形容白人。（他的话是：“白种人（即漂白过的）北欧血统的人类。 .. .”）汤因比还将欧洲地理区域仅称为亚洲的一个半岛。他说，欧洲并不存在。如果你看看地球仪，你会亲眼看到美国只是亚洲的延伸。（但与此同时，汤因比也是那些帮助漂白历史的人之一。他曾写道，非洲是唯一没有历史的大陆。他不会再写那样的话了。现在每天都有真相浮出水面。）
I never will forget how shocked I was when I began reading about slavery's total horror. It madesuch an impact upon me that it later became one of my favorite subjects when I became aminister of Mr. Muhammad's. The world's most monstrous crime, the sin and the blood on thewhite man's hands, are almost impossible to believe. Books like the one by Frederick Olmsteadopened my eyes to the horrors suffered when the slave was landed in the United States. TheEuropean woman, Fannie Kimball, who had married a Southern white slaveowner, described howhuman beings were degraded. Of course I read _Uncle Tom's Cabin_. In fact, I believe that's theonly novel I have ever read since I started serious reading. 
我永远不会忘记当我开始阅读关于奴隶制的全面恐怖时，我有多么震惊。它对我产生了如此大的影响，以至于后来成为我成为穆罕默德先生部长时最喜欢的科目之一。世界上最可怕的罪行，即白人手中的罪过和鲜血，几乎难以置信。像弗雷德里克·奥姆斯特德这样的书籍使我看到了奴隶在美国登陆后所遭受的恐怖。欧洲女性范妮·金博尔（Fannie Kimball）嫁给了一个南方白人奴隶主，描述了人类是如何被贬低的。当然，我也读了《汤姆叔叔的小屋》。实际上，我相信这是我开始认真阅读以来唯一一本小说。
Parkhurst's collection also contained some bound pamphlets of the Abolitionist Anti-SlaverySociety of New England. I read descriptions of atrocities, saw those illustrations of black slavewomen tied up and flogged with whips; of black mothers watching their babies being dragged off,never to be seen by their mothers again; of dogs after slaves, and of the fugitive slave catchers,evil white men with whips and clubs and chains and guns. I read about the slave preacher NatTurner, who put the fear of God into the white slavemaster. Nat Turner wasn't going aroundpreaching pie-in-the-sky and "non-violent" freedom for the black man. There in Virginia one nightin 1831, Nat and seven other slaves started out at his master's home and through the night theywent from one plantation "big house" to the next, killing, until by the next morning57 white peoplewere dead and Nat had about 70 slaves following him. White people, terrified for their lives, fledfrom their homes, locked themselves up in public buildings, hid in the woods, and some even leftthe state. A small army of soldiers took two months to catch and hang Nat Turner. Somewhere Ihave read where Nat Turner's example is said to have inspired John Brown to invade Virginia andattack Harper's Ferry nearly thirty years later, with thirteen white men and five Negroes. 
帕克斯赫斯特的收藏还包括一些新英格兰废奴主义者反奴隶制协会的册子。
I read Herodotus, "the father of History," or, rather, I read about him. And I read the histories ofvarious nations, which opened my eyes gradually, then wider and wider, to how the whole world'swhite men had indeed acted like devils, pillaging and raping and bleeding and draining the wholeworld's non-white people. I remember, for instance, books such as Will Durant's story of Orientalcivilization, and Mahatma Gandhi's accounts of the struggle to drive the British out of India. 
我读了“历史之父”希罗多德，或者说，我了解了他的事迹。我阅读了各个国家的历史，这些书逐渐地、然后越来越广泛地开阔了我的视野，让我看到整个世界的白人实际上都像恶魔一样行为，掠夺、强奸、流血和榨干全世界的非白人人民。我记得，比如，威尔·杜兰特关于东方文明的故事，以及圣雄甘地描述的将英国人赶出印度的斗争。
Book after book showed me how the white man had brought upon the world's black, brown, red,and yellow peoples every variety of the sufferings of exploitation. I saw how since the sixteenthcentury, the so-called "Christian trader" white man began to ply the seas in his lust for Asian andAfrican empires, and plunder, and power. I read, I saw, how the white man never has goneamong the non-white peoples bearing the Cross in the true manner and spirit of Christ'steachings-meek, humble, and Christ-like. 
一本书接一本书向我展示了白人如何带给世界上的黑人、棕色人种、红种人和黄种人各种形式的剥削之苦。我看到了从十六世纪开始，所谓的“基督教商人”白人为了满足对亚洲和非洲帝国、掠夺和权力的欲望，开始在海上航行。我读到，我看到，白人从未真正带着十字架以基督教导的谦卑、卑微和类似基督的方式深入到非白人人民中间。
I perceived, as I read, how the collective white man had been actually nothing but a piraticalopportunist who used Faustian machinations to make his own Christianity his initial wedge incriminal conquests. First, always "religiously," he branded "heathen" and "pagan" labels uponancient non-white cultures and civilizations. The stage thus set, he then turned upon his non- white victims his weapons of war. 
在我阅读的过程中，我意识到整个白人集体实际上只是一个海盗式的投机者，他利用浮士德式的阴谋将自己的基督教作为犯罪征服的起点。首先，他总是“宗教性地”将“异教徒”和“异端邪说”的标签贴在古老的非白人文化和文明上。然后，他将这些标签变成了自己对非白人受害者的战争武器。
  I read how, entering India-half a _billion_ deeply religious brown people-the British white man, by1759, through promises, trickery and manipulations, controlled much of India through GreatBritain's East India Company. The parasitical British administration kept tentacling out to half ofthe subcontinent. In 1857, some of the desperate people of India finally mutinied-and, exceptingthe African slave trade, nowhere has history recorded any more unnecessary bestial and ruthlesshuman carnage than the British suppression of the non-white Indian people. 
我读到，当英国人进入印度时——那里有五亿个虔诚的棕色人种——他们通过承诺、诡计和操纵，到1759年已经通过大不列颠东印度公司控制了印度的大部分地区。寄生的英国政府不断向次大陆伸出触角。在1857年，一些印度人的绝望最终演变成了暴乱——除了非洲奴隶贸易，没有其他历史记录显示过比英国镇压非白人印度人更没有必要的野蛮和残忍的人屠杀。
Over 115 million African blacks-close to the 1930's population of the United States-weremurdered or enslaved during the slave trade. And I read how when the slave market was glutted,the cannibalistic white powers of Europe next carved up, as their colonies, the richest areas of theblack continent. And Europe's chancelleries for the next century played a chess game of nakedexploitation and power from Cape Horn to Cairo. 
在奴隶贸易中，超过1.15亿非洲黑人被杀害或奴役，接近20世纪30年代美国的人口。我读到当奴隶市场饱和时，欧洲的食人主义白人力量作为他们的殖民地，将非洲大陆最富裕的地区分割开来。而欧洲各国的大使馆在下个世纪里从合恩角到开罗进行了赤裸裸的剥削和权力的游戏。
Ten guards and the warden couldn't have torn me out of those books. Not even Elijah Muhammadcould have been more eloquent than those books were in providing indisputable proof that thecollective white man had acted like a devil in virtually every contact he had with the world'scollective non-white man. I listen today to the radio, and watch television, and read the headlinesabout the collective white man's fear and tension concerning China. When the white manprofesses ignorance about why the Chinese hate him so, my mind can't help flashing back towhat I read, there in prison, about how the blood forebears of this same white man raped Chinaat a time when China was trusting and helpless. Those original white "Christian traders" sent intoChina millions of pounds of opium. By 1839, so many of the Chinese were addicts that China'sdesperate government destroyed twenty thousand chests of opium. The first Opium War waspromptly declared by the white man. Imagine! Declaring _war_ upon someone who objects tobeing narcotized! The Chinese were severely beaten, with Chinese-invented gunpowder.The Treaty of Nanking made China pay the British white man for the destroyed opium; forcedopen China's major ports to British trade; forced China to abandon Hong Kong; fixed China'simport tariffs so low that cheap British articles soon flooded in, maiming China's industrialdevelopment. 
十个警卫和典狱长不可能把我从那些书里扯出来。即使是伊利亚·穆罕默德也不可能比那些书更雄辩，他提供了无可争辩的证据，证明集体白人在与世界集体非白人的几乎每一次接触中都表现得像个魔鬼。我今天听广播，看电视，读关于白人对中国的集体恐惧和紧张的头条新闻。当白人男子声称不知道为什么中国人如此恨他时，我的脑海里不禁闪回到我在监狱里读到的东西，关于同一个白人男子的血亲祖先如何强奸中国，当时中国是信任和无助的。那些最初的白人“基督教商人”向中国运送了数百万磅的鸦片。到1839年，如此多的中国人成了瘾君子，以至于绝望的中国政府销毁了2万箱鸦片。第一次鸦片战争是由白人迅速宣布的。想象！_向反对被麻醉的人宣布_战争。中国人遭到了中国人发明的火药的毒打，《南京条约》要求中国向英国白人支付销毁鸦片的费用。强迫中国的主要港口对英国贸易开放；迫使中国放弃香港；中国的进口关税如此之低，以至于廉价的英国商品很快涌入，阻碍了中国的工业发展。
After a second Opium War, the Tientsin Treaties legalized the ravaging opium trade, legalized aBritish-French-American control of China's customs. China tried delaying that Treaty's ratification;Peking was looted and burned. 
第二次鸦片战争后，《天津条约》使掠夺性的鸦片贸易合法化，并使得英法美三国控制中国的海关成为合法。中国试图推迟批准该条约，但北京遭到了洗劫和焚毁。
"Kill the foreign white devils!" was the 1901 Chinese war cry in the Boxer Rebellion. Losing again,this time the Chinese were driven from Peking's choicest areas. The vicious, arrogant white manput up the famous signs, "Chinese and dogs not allowed." 
“杀死外国的白人恶魔！”这是1901年中国在义和团运动中的口号。再次失败后，中国人被迫离开北京最富裕的地区。残忍、傲慢的白人张贴了著名的标语，“中国人和狗不允许入内”。
Red China after World War II closed its doors to the Western white world. Massive Chineseagricultural, scientific, and industrial efforts are described in a book that _Life_ magazine recentlypublished. Some observers inside Red China have reported that the world never has known sucha hate-white campaign as is now going on in this non-white country where, present birth-ratescontinuing, in fifty more years Chinese will be half the earth's population. And it seems that someChinese chickens will soon come home to roost, with China's recent successful nuclear tests. 
二战后，红色中国对西方白人世界关闭了大门。 《生活》杂志最近出版了一本描述中国大规模农业、科学和工业成就的书。红色中国的一些观察家报告说，世界从未见过如此的反白人运动，这个非白人国家正在进行这样的运动，如果目前的出生率继续下去，再过50年，中国人将成为地球人口的一半。而且，随着中国最近成功的核试验，似乎有些中国鸡很快就会回到自己的窝里。
Let us face reality. We can see in the United Nations a new world order being shaped, along colorlines-an alliance among the non-white nations. America's U. N. Ambassador Adlai Stevensoncomplained not long ago that in the United Nations "a skin game" was being played. He was right.He was facing reality. A "skin game" _is_ being played. But Ambassador Stevenson sounded likeJesse James accusing the marshal of carrying a gun. Because who in the world's history everhas played a worse "skin game" than the white man?*     *     * 
让我们面对现实。我们可以在联合国看到，一种新的世界秩序正在被塑造，沿着种族界线-非白人国家之间的联盟。美国驻联合国大使阿德莱·史蒂文森不久前抱怨说，在联合国“肤色游戏”正在进行中。他是对的。他面对了现实。一场“肤色游戏”确实正在进行中。但是史蒂文森大使听起来像是杰西·詹姆斯指责元帅携带枪支一样。因为世界上有谁比白人进行过更糟糕的“肤色游戏”呢？
Mr. Muhammad, to whom I was writing daily, had no idea of what a new world had opened up tome through my efforts to document his teachings in books. 
每天我都在写信给穆罕默德先生，他不知道通过我的努力将他的言论记录在书籍中，为我打开了一个全新的世界。
When I discovered philosophy, I tried to touch all the landmarks of philosophical development.Gradually, I read most of the old philosophers, Occidental and Oriental. The Oriental philosopherswere the ones I came to prefer; finally, my impression was that most Occidental philosophy hadlargely been borrowed from the Oriental thinkers. Socrates, for instance, traveled in Egypt. Somesources even say that Socrates was initiated into some of the Egyptian mysteries. ObviouslySocrates got some of his wisdom among the East's wise men. 
当我发现了哲学，我试图触及哲学发展的所有里程碑。逐渐地，我阅读了大多数古老的哲学家，西方和东方的。东方哲学家是我更喜欢的；最终，我的印象是大多数西方哲学很大程度上是从东方思想家那里借来的。例如，苏格拉底曾经在埃及旅行。一些资料甚至说苏格拉底被引入了一些埃及的神秘事物中。显然，苏格拉底从东方智者那里得到了一些智慧。
I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there in prisonthat reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awokeinside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive. I certainly wasn't seeking any degree,the way a college confers a status symbol upon its students. My homemade education gave me,with every additional book that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, andblindness that was afflicting the black race in America. Not long ago, an English writer telephonedme from London, asking questions. One was, "What's your alma mater?" I told him, "Books." Youwill never catch me with a free fifteen minutes in which I'm not studying something I feel might beable to help the black man. 
我经常反思阅读给我带来的新视野。我在监狱里就意识到，阅读永远改变了我的人生轨迹。如今，我认为能够阅读使我内心沉睡的渴望变得活跃起来，渴望变得有思想。我并不是像大学生那样追求学位，我的家庭教育给了我更多的书籍，每读一本书都让我更加敏感地认识到美国黑人所面临的聋哑和失明问题。不久前，一位英国作家从伦敦打电话给我，询问一些问题。其中一个问题是：“你的母校是哪所大学？”我告诉他：“是图书馆。”你永远不会看到我有空闲的十五分钟不去学习一些我认为可能有助于黑人的东西。
Yesterday I spoke in London, and both ways on the plane across the Atlantic I was studying adocument about how the United Nations proposes to insure the human rights of the oppressedminorities of the world. The American blackman is the world's most shameful case of minorityoppression. What makes the black man think of himself as only an internal United States issue isjust a catch-phrase, two words, "civil rights." How is the black man going to get "civil rights" beforefirst he wins his _human_ rights? If the American black man will start thinking about his _human_rights, and then start thinking of himself as part of one of the world's great peoples, he will see hehas a case for the United Nations. 
昨天我在伦敦发表演讲，在飞越大西洋的飞机上，我都在研究一份关于联合国如何保障被压迫的少数民族人权的文件。美国黑人是世界上被压迫的少数民族最可耻的案例之一。让黑人认为自己只事关美国内部的问题只是一个口号，就是“民权”这两个字。在赢得他的人权之前，黑人如何获得“民权”？如果美国黑人开始思考他的人权问题，然后开始将自己视为世界上最伟大人民之一的一部分，他将意识到他有向联合国申诉的理由。
I can't think of a better case! Four hundred years of black blood and sweat invested here inAmerica, and the white man still has the black man begging for what every immigrant fresh off theship can take for granted the minute he walks down the gangplank. 
我想不出比这更好的例子了！四百年来黑人的血汗都投入到美国，但白人仍然让黑人乞求那些刚下船的移民能够享受的权利，而移民们一踏上码头就可以理所当然地获得这些权利。
But I'm digressing. I told the Englishman that my alma mater was books, a good library. Everytime I catch a plane, I have with me a book that I want to read-and that's a lot of books thesedays. If I weren't out here every day battling the white man, I could spend the rest of my lifereading, just satisfying my curiosity-because you can hardly mention anything I'm not curiousabout. I don't think anybody ever got more out of going to prison than I did. In fact, prison enabledme to study far more intensively than I would have if my life had gone differently and I hadattended some college. I imagine that one of the biggest troubles with colleges is there are toomany distractions, too much panty-raiding, fraternities, and boola-boola and all of that. Whereelse but in a prison could I have attacked my ignorance by being able to study intenselysometimes as much as fifteen hours a day? 
但我有点跑题了。我告诉那个英国人，我的母校是图书馆，一个非常好的图书馆。每次我坐飞机都会带上一本书，想读的书很多——现在书也很多。如果我不每天与白人作斗争，我可以花余生的时间阅读，满足我的好奇心——因为你几乎不能提到任何我不好奇的事情。我认为没有人比我从监狱中获得更多的东西。实际上，监狱让我能够更加深入地学习，如果我的生活不同，没有进过监狱，我可能会去上大学。我想大学最大的问题之一是有很多分心的事情，比如女生之间的争斗、兄弟会等等。除了在监狱里，我还能在哪里通过每天长达15个小时的高强度学习来战胜无知？
Schopenhauer, Kant, Nietzsche, naturally, I read all of those. I don't respect them; I am just tryingto remember some of those whose theories I soaked up in those years. These three, it's said, laidthe groundwork on which the Fascist and Nazi philosophy was built. I don't respect them becauseit seems to me that most of their time was spent arguing about things that are not reallyimportant.They remind me of so many of the Negro "intellectuals," so-called, with whom I havecome in contact-they are always arguing about something useless. 
叔本华、康德、尼采，我当然都读过了。我并不尊重他们，我只是试图回忆起那些年里我所吸收的理论。据说这三个人奠定了法西斯主义和纳粹主义哲学的基础。我不尊重他们，因为在我看来，他们大部分时间都在争论一些并不真正重要的事情。他们让我想起了很多所谓的黑人“知识分子”，我和他们交往时，他们总是在争论一些毫无意义的事情。
Spinoza impressed me for a while when I found out that he was black. A black Spanish Jew. TheJews excommunicated him because he advocated a pantheistic doctrine, something like the"allness of God," or "God in everything." The Jews read their burial services for Spinoza, meaningthat he was dead as far as they were concerned; his family was run out of Spain, they ended upin Holland, I think. 
当我得知斯宾诺莎是黑人时，他给我留下了深刻的印象。他是西班牙犹太人中的黑人。由于他主张泛神论学说，类似于“上帝无所不在”或“上帝存在于一切事物中”，犹太人将他除名。犹太人为斯宾诺莎举行了葬礼仪式，意味着在他们看来，他已经死了；他的家人被迫离开西班牙，最后到了荷兰。
I'll tell you something. The whole stream of Western philosophy has now wound up in a cul-de- sac. The white man has perpetrated upon himself, as well as upon the black man, so gigantic afraud that he has put himself into a crack. He did it through his elaborate, neurotic necessity tohide the black man's true role in history. 
我要告诉你一些事情。西方哲学的整个脉络现在已经陷入了死胡同。白人对自己以及黑人犯下了如此巨大的欺骗，以至于他把自己困在了一个漏洞中。他通过精心制定、神经质地需要隐藏黑人在历史上的真正作用来实现这一点。
And today the white man is faced head on with what is happening on the Black Continent, Africa.Look at the artifacts being discovered there, that are proving over and over again, how the blackman had great, fine, sensitive civilizations before the white man was out of the caves. Below theSahara, in the places where most of America's Negroes' foreparents were kidnapped, there isbeing unearthed some of the finest craftsmanship, sculpture and other objects, that has everbeen seen by modern man. Some of these things now are on view in such places as New YorkCity's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gold work of such fine tolerance and workmanship that it hasno rival. Ancient objects produced by black hands. . . refined by those black hands with resultsthat no human hand today can equal. 
今天，白人正面对非洲大陆上正在发生的事情。看看那里发现的文物，它们一次又一次地证明了在白人走出洞穴之前，黑人曾经拥有伟大的、精致的、敏感的文明。在撒哈拉沙漠下面，在美国黑人祖先被绑架的那些地方，人们正在发掘一些有史以来现代人类所见过的最好的手工艺品、雕塑和其他物品。其中一些现在在纽约市大都会艺术博物馆等地展出。黄金制品的精细程度和工艺水平无与伦比。这些古代物品是由黑人制作的，经过他们精心制作，其结果今天的人类无法与之相比。
History has been so "whitened" by the white man that even the black professors have known littlemore than the most ignorant black man about the talents and rich civilizations and cultures of theblack man of millenniums ago. Ihave lectured in Negro colleges and some of these brainwashedblack Ph.D.'s, with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees, have run to the whiteman's newspapers calling me a "black fanatic." Why, a lot of them are fifty years behind the times.If I were president of one of these black colleges, I'd hock the campus if I had to, to send a bunchof black students off digging in Africa for more, more and more proof of the black race's historicalgreatness. The white man now is in Africa digging and searching. An African elephant can'tstumble without falling on some white man with a shovel. Practically every week, we read aboutsome great new find from Africa's lost civilizations. All that's new is white science's attitude. Theancient civilizations of the black man have been buried on the Black Continent all the time. 
历史上白人对黑人进行了“漂白”，即使是黑人教授也对千年前的黑人的才能、丰富文明和文化知之甚少。我在黑人大学演讲，其中一些被洗脑的黑人博士戴着吊带，拖着学位走来走去，跑到白人报纸上称我为“黑人狂热分子”。为什么？他们中的许多人都落后于时代。如果我是这些黑人大学的校长，我会为了送一群黑人学生去非洲挖掘更多、更多的证据，证明黑人种族的历史伟大而不得不出卖校园。现在白人正在非洲挖掘和搜寻。一只非洲象不可能没有遇到拿着铲子的白人就跌倒。几乎每周我们都会读到来自非洲失落文明的一些重大新发现。所有新事物都是白人科学的态度。黑人的古代文明一直在黑大陆上被埋葬。
Here is an example: a British anthropologist named Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey is displaying somefossil bones-a foot, part of a hand, some jaws, and skull fragments. On the basis of these, Dr.Leakey has said it's time to rewrite completely the history of man's origin. 
这里有一个案例：一位名叫路易斯·S·B·利基的英国人类学家正在展示一些化石骨骼——一只脚、一只手的部分、一些颚和头骨碎片。基于这些，利基博士表示是时候完全重写人类起源的历史了。
This species of man lived 1,818,036 years before Christ. And these bones were found inTanganyika. In the Black Continent. 
这种人类生活在基督前1,818,036年。这些骨骼是在黑大陆坦噶尼喀被发现的。
It's a crime, the lie that has been told to generations of black men and white men both. Littleinnocent black children, born of parents who believed that their race had no history. Little blackchildren seeing, before they could talk, that their parents considered themselves inferior. Innocentblack children growing up, living out their lives, dying of old age-and all of their lives ashamed ofbeing black. But the truth is pouring out of the bag now. 
这是一种罪行，对世世代代的黑人和白人都撒谎。小小的无辜的黑人孩子，出生在父母认为他们的种族没有历史的家庭中。小小的黑人孩子在能说话之前就看到父母认为自己低人一等。无辜的黑人孩子成长、生活、衰老，一生都因自己是黑人而感到羞耻。但现在真相正在被揭露。
Two other areas of experience which have been extremely formative in my life since prison werefirst opened to me in the Norfolk Prison Colony. For one thing, I had my first experiences inopening the eyes of my brainwashed black brethren to some truths about the black race. And, theother: when I had readenough to know something, I began to enter the Prison Colony's weeklydebating program-my baptism into public speaking. 
我在诺福克监狱殖民地获得了另外两个对我的人生影响极大的经验。首先，我在那里第一次尝试着让我那些被洗脑的黑人同胞们看到一些关于黑人种族的真相。另一个是：当我读够了足够多的东西，开始了解一些事情时，我开始参加监狱殖民地每周的辩论活动——这是我公开演讲的洗礼。
I have to admit a sad, shameful fact. I had so loved being around the white man that in prison Ireally disliked how Negro convicts stuck together so much. But when Mr. Muhammad's teachingsreversed my attitude toward my black brothers, in my guilt and shame I began to catch everychance I could to recruit for Mr. Muhammad. 
我必须承认一个可悲、可耻的事实。我曾经非常热爱和白人在一起，但在监狱里我却真的不喜欢黑人囚犯们之间的紧密团结。但是当穆罕默德先生的教学改变了我对我黑人兄弟们的态度时，在我的内疚和羞耻中我开始抓住每一个机会来为穆罕默德先生招募新成员。
You have to be careful, very careful, introducing the truth to the black man who has neverpreviously heard the truth about himself, his own kind, and the white man. My brother Reginaldhad told me that all Muslims experienced this in their recruiting for Mr. Muhammad. The blackbrother is so brainwashed that he may even be repelled when he first hears the truth. Reginaldadvised that the truth had to be dropped only a little bit at a time. And you had to wait a while tolet it sink in before advancing the next step. 
你必须非常小心，在从未听说过关于自己、自己种族和白人的真相的黑人面前引入真相。我的兄弟雷金纳德告诉我，所有穆斯林在为穆罕默德招募时都会经历这一点。这个黑人兄弟被洗脑得如此严重，他甚至可能在第一次听到真相时感到反感。雷金纳德建议只能逐渐地透露真相，每次透露一点，然后等待一段时间让它沉淀下来，再进行下一步。
I began first telling my black brother inmates about the glorious history of the black man-thingsthey never had dreamed. I told them the horrible slavery-trade truths that they never knew. 
我开始首先向我的黑人狱友讲述黑人的辉煌历史——他们从未梦想过的事情。我告诉他们他们从未知道过的可怕的奴隶贸易真相。
I would watch their faces when I told them about that, because the white man had completelyerased the slaves' past, a Negro in America can never know his true family name, or even whattribe he was descended from: the Mandingos, the Wolof, the Serer, the Fula, the Fanti, theAshanti, or others. I told them that some slaves brought from Africa spoke Arabic, and wereIslamic in their religion. A lot of these black convicts still wouldn't believe it unless they could seethat a white man had said it. So, often, I would read to these brothers selected passages fromwhite men's books. I'd explain to them that the real truth was known to some white men, thescholars; but there had been a conspiracy down through the generations to keep the truth fromblack men.I would keep close watch on how each one reacted. I always had to be careful. I never knewwhen some brainwashed black imp, some dyed-in-the-wool Uncle Tom, would nod at me andthen go running to tell the white man. W hen one was ripe-and I could tell-then away from the rest,I'd drop it on him, what Mr. Muhammad taught: "The white man is the devil." 
每当我告诉他们这些事情时，我都会观察他们的表情，因为白人已经彻底抹去了奴隶的过去。在美国的一个黑人永远无法知道他的真实姓氏，甚至无法知道他是哪个部落的后裔：曼丁哥人、沃洛夫人、塞雷尔人、富拉人、芬蒂人、阿善提人或其他部落的人。我告诉他们有些从非洲运来的奴隶会说阿拉伯语，他们的宗教信仰是伊斯兰教。许多这些黑人罪犯仍然不会相信，除非他们能看到一个白人说过这些话。因此，我经常向这些被选中的兄弟朗读白人的书中的一些段落。我向他们解释真正的真相只有一些白人学者知道，但是有一个世代相传的阴谋让黑人无法了解真相。我会密切观察每个人的反应，我总是必须小心谨慎。我永远不知道有些被洗脑的黑人恶棍或者彻头彻尾的汤姆叔叔会在我点头后跑去告诉白人。当一个人准备好了——我能看出来——并能够独立思考时，我会向他传达穆罕默德先生教给我的话：“白人是魔鬼。”
That would shock many of them-until they started thinking about it. 
这会震惊他们中的许多人，直到他们开始思考。
This is probably as big a single worry as the American prison system has today-the way theMuslim teachings, circulated among all Negroes in the country, are converting new Muslimsamong black men in prison, and black men are in prison in far greater numbers than theirproportion in the population. 
这可能是美国监狱系统中当前最大的担忧之一——穆斯林教义在该国所有黑人中传播，正在转化新的穆斯林囚犯，而黑人男性在监狱中的数量远远超过他们在总人口中的比例。
The reason is that among all Negroes the black convict is the most perfectly preconditioned tohear the words, "the white man is the devil." 
原因是在所有黑人中，黑人罪犯是最完美地准备好听到“白人是魔鬼”的话语的。
You tell that to any Negro. Except for those relatively few "integration"-mad so-called"intellectuals," and those black men who are otherwise fat, happy, and deaf, dumb, and blinded,with their crumbs from the white man's rich table, you have struck a nerve center in the Americanblack man. He may take a day to react, a month, a year; he may never respond, openly; but ofone thing you can be sure-when he thinks about his own life, he is going to see where, to him,personally, the white man sure has acted like a devil. 
你把这个告诉任何黑人。除了那些相对少数的“融合”狂热分子，以及那些肥胖、快乐、聋哑和盲目的黑人男性，他们从白人富人的丰盛餐桌上得到了一些残羹剩饭之外，你已经触及了美国黑人的神经中枢。他可能需要一天时间来反应，一个月或一年；他可能永远不会公开回应；但有一件事你可以肯定——当他思考自己的生活时，他会看到对于他个人而言，白人肯定表现得像个魔鬼。
And, as I say, above all Negroes, the black prisoner. Here is a black man caged behind bars,probably for years, put there by the white man. Usually the convict comes from among thosebottom-of-the-pile Negroes, the Negroes who through their entire lives have been kicked about,treated like children-Negroes who never have met one white man who didn't either takesomething from them or do something to them.You let this caged-up black man start thinking, the same way I did when I first heard ElijahMuhammad's teachings: let him start thinking how, with better breaks when he was young andambitious he might have been a lawyer, a doctor, a scientist, anything. You let this caged-up blackman start realizing, as I did, how from the first landing of the first slave ship, the millions of blackmen in America have been like sheep in a den of wolves. That's why black prisoners becomeMuslims so fast when Elijah Muhammad's teachings filter into their cages by way of other Muslimconvicts. "The white man is the devil" is a perfect echo of that black convict's lifelong experience. 
正如我所说，尤其是黑人囚犯。这里有一个被白人囚禁在狱中的黑人，可能已经被困数年。通常这些罪犯来自于底层黑人，那些在整个生命中一直被踢来踢去、像孩子一样被对待的黑人，他们从未遇到过一个不从他们身上拿走东西或对他们做点什么的白人。当你让这个被囚禁的黑人开始思考时，就像我第一次听到伊莱贾·穆罕默德的教导时所做的那样：让他开始思考如果他年轻时有更多的机会和雄心勃勃的目标，他可能会成为一名律师、医生、科学家或其他任何事情。当你让这个被囚禁的黑人开始意识到时，就像我所做的那样，从第一艘运奴船着陆的那一刻起，数百万在美国的黑人就像圈养在狼窝中的羊群一样。这就是为什么当伊莱贾·穆罕默德的教导通过其他穆斯林囚犯传入他们的牢房时，黑人囚犯会如此迅速地成为穆斯林。 “白人是魔鬼”是对那个黑人罪犯终身经历的完美回响。
I've told how debating was a weekly event there at the Norfolk Prison Colony. My reading had mymind like steam under pressure. Some way, I had to start telling the white man about himself tohis face. I decided I could do this by putting my name down to debate. 
我已经描述了在诺福克监狱殖民地每周一次的辩论活动。我的阅读让我的思想像蒸汽一样受压。无论如何，我必须开始当面告诉这个白人关于他自己的事情。我决定通过报名参加辩论来做到这一点。
Standing up and speaking before an audience was a thing that throughout my previous life neverwould have crossed my mind. Out there in the streets, hustling, pushing dope, and robbing, Icould have had the dreams from a pound of hashish and I'd never have dreamed anything so wildas that one day I would speak in coliseums and arenas, at the greatest American universities, andon radio and television programs, not to mention speaking all over Egypt and Africa and inEngland. 
在观众面前站起来说话在我之前的生命中从未想过的事情。在街上，奔波、推毒品和抢劫，我可能已经梦想着一磅的哈希什，我从没有想过任何事情会像有一天我会在竞技场、大型美国大学、广播电台和电视节目上发言那样疯狂，更不用说在整个埃及、非洲和英格兰发表演讲了。
But I will tell you that, right there, in the prison, debating, speaking to a crowd, was as exhilaratingto me as the discovery of knowledge through reading had been. Standing up there, the faceslooking up at me, things in my head coming out of my mouth, while my brain searched for thenext best thing to follow what I was saying, and if I could sway them to my side by handling itright, then I had won the debate-once my feet got wet, I was gone on debating. Whichever side ofthe selected subject was assigned to me, I'd track down andstudy everything I could find on it. I'dput myself in my opponent's place and decide how I'd try to win if I had the other side; and thenI'd figure a way to knock down those points. And if there was any way in the world, I'd work intomy speech the devilishness of the white man. 
但我要告诉你们，在监狱里辩论、向人群发言对我来说和通过阅读获得知识一样令人兴奋。站在那里，面前的人们仰望着我，脑海中的想法从我的嘴里流出，而我的大脑则在寻找接下来最好的事情来跟随我所说的内容。如果我能够通过正确处理问题来让他们站在我这边，那么我就赢得了这场辩论——一旦我开始行动，我就会一直辩论下去。无论被指定为哪个主题的一方，我都会尽可能地研究所有有关它的信息。我会将自己置身于对手的位置，决定如果我有另一方的话我会如何争取胜利；然后我会想出一种方法来击败这些观点。如果有任何方法可以让我的言论更加有力，我会将白人的邪恶性加入其中。
"Compulsory Military Training-Or None?" That's one good chance I got unexpectedly, I remember.My opponent flailed the air about the Ethiopians throwing rocks and spears at Italian airplanes,"proving" that compulsory military training was needed. I said the Ethiopians' black flesh had beenspattered against trees by bombs the Pope in Rome had blessed, and the Ethiopians would havethrown even their bare bodies at the airplanes because they had seen that they were fighting thedevil incarnate. 
“强制性军事训练——否则就没什么可做的了？”我记得我突然得到了一个很好的机会。我的对手抨击着埃塞俄比亚人，指责他们向意大利飞机扔石头和长矛，以此来证明需要进行强制性军事训练。我说埃塞俄比亚人的黑色肌肤被罗马教皇祝福的炸弹溅到树木上，而且埃塞俄比亚人会用他们裸露的身体去撞击飞机，因为他们已经看到他们在与恶魔作战。
They yelled "foul," that I'd made the subject a race issue. I said it wasn't race, it was a historicalfact, that they ought to go and read Pierre van Paassen's _Days of Our Years_, and somethingnot surprising to me, that book, right after the debate, disappeared from the prison library. It wasright there in prison that I made up my mind to devote the rest of my life to telling the white manabout himself-or die. In a debate about whether or not Homer had ever existed, I threw into thosewhite faces the theory that Homer only symbolized how white Europeans kidnapped blackAfricans, then blinded them so that they could never get back to their own people. (Homer andOmar and Moor, you see, are related terms; it's like saying Peter, Pedro, and petra, all three ofwhich mean rock. ) These blinded Moors the Europeans taught to sing about the Europeans'glorious accomplishments. I made it clear that was the devilish white man's idea of kicks. Aesop's_Fables_-another case in point. "Aesop" was only the Greek name for an Ethiopian. 
他们大喊“犯规了”，说我把主题变成了种族问题。我说这不是种族问题，而是历史事实，他们应该去读一下皮埃尔·范·帕森斯的《岁月的痕迹》，这本书对我来说并不意外，因为在辩论结束后，这本书就从监狱图书馆中消失了。正是在监狱里，我下定决心要用自己的余生告诉白人他们自己——否则就死去。在一场关于荷马是否真的存在的辩论中，我将白人的面孔描绘成一幅画面：欧洲白人绑架非洲黑人，然后使他们失明，这样他们就无法回到自己的人民中去。（荷马、奥马尔和摩尔这三个词是有关联的；就像说彼得、佩德罗和彼得拉一样，它们都意味着岩石。）这些被蒙蔽的摩尔人被教导唱欧洲人的光荣成就。我明确表示这是邪恶的白人的想法。伊索的寓言——另一个例子。《伊索》这个名字只是埃塞俄比亚人的希腊名字。
Another hot debate I remember I was in had to do with the identity of Shakespeare. No color wasinvolved there; I just got intrigued over the Shakespearean dilemma. The King James translationof the Bible is considered the greatestpiece of literature in English. Its language supposedlyrepresents the ultimate in using the King's English. Well, Shakespeare's language and the Bible'slanguage are one and the same. They say that from 1604 to  1611, King James got poets totranslate, to write the Bible. Well, if Shakespeare existed, he was then the top poet around. ButShakespeare is nowhere reported connected with the Bible. If he existed, why didn't King Jamesuse him? And if he did use him, why is it one of the world's best kept secrets? 
我记得我参与的另一个热烈的辩论是关于莎士比亚的身份。那里没有涉及种族问题，我只是对莎士比亚的困境感到好奇。人们普遍认为，詹姆斯国王翻译的圣经是英国文学中最伟大的作品之一。据说它的语言代表了使用国王英语的最终形式。然而，莎士比亚的语言和圣经的语言实际上是相同的。他们说从1604年到1611年，詹姆斯国王让诗人翻译圣经并写下来。如果莎士比亚存在的话，那么他当时就是顶级诗人之一。但是，没有任何报道指出莎士比亚与圣经有关联。如果他存在的话，为什么詹姆斯国王不利用他呢？如果他确实利用了他，为什么这是一个世界上最好的秘密之一呢？
I know that many say that Francis Bacon was Shakespeare. If that is true, why would Bacon havekept it secret? Bacon wasn't royalty, when royalty sometimes used the _nom de plume_ becauseit was "improper" for royalty to be artistic or theatrical. What would Bacon have had to lose?Bacon, in fact, would have had everything to gain. 
我知道很多人说弗朗西斯·培根就是莎士比亚。如果这是真的，为什么培根要保密呢？培根不是皇室成员，而皇室成员有时会使用笔名，因为对于皇室成员来说，从事艺术或戏剧活动是“不合适”的。培根会失去什么呢？事实上，培根会获得一切。
In the prison debates I argued for the theory that King James himself was the real poet who usedthe _nom de plume_ Shakespeare. King James was brilliant. He was the greatest king who eversat on the British throne. Who else among royalty, in his time, would have had the giant talent towrite Shakespeare's works? It was he who poetically "fixed" the Bible-which in itself and itspresent King James version has enslaved the world. 
在监狱辩论中，我提出了这样一个理论：真正的诗人是使用笔名莎士比亚的国王詹姆斯。詹姆斯国王才华横溢。他是英国历史上最伟大的国王。在他那个时代，还有谁能像他一样拥有巨大的才能来写出莎士比亚的作品呢？正是他“诗意地”固定了圣经——而圣经本身及其现在的国王詹姆斯版本已经奴役了世界。
*     *     * 
When my brother Reginald visited, I would talk to him about new evidence I found to documentthe Muslim teachings. In either volume 43 or 44 of The Harvard Classics, I read Milton's_Paradise Lost_. The devil, kicked out of Paradise, was trying to regain possession. He wasusing the forces of Europe, personified by the Popes, Charlemagne, Richard the Lionhearted,and other knights. I interpreted this to show that the Europeans were motivated and led by thedevil, or the personification of the devil. So Milton and Mr. Elijah Muhammad were actually sayingthe same thing.I couldn't believe it when Reginald began to speak ill of Elijah Muhammad. I can't specify theexact things he said. They were more in the nature of implications against Mr. Muhammad-thepitch of Reginald's voice, or the way that Reginald looked, rather than what he said. 
当我的兄弟雷金纳德来访时，我会和他谈论我找到的新证据来证明穆斯林教义的真实性。在哈佛经典丛书的第43或44卷中，我读了弥尔顿的《失乐园》。被踢出天堂的魔鬼试图重新夺回它。他利用了被教皇、查理曼大帝、狮心王理查和其他骑士所象征化的欧洲力量。我将其解读为欧洲人受到魔鬼或其化身的驱使和领导。因此，弥尔顿和伊莱贾·穆罕默德实际上是在说同样的事情。当雷金纳德开始诋毁伊莱贾·穆罕默德时，我无法相信。我无法具体说出他说了什么。更多的是针对穆罕默德先生的意思-雷金纳德的语气或他的外表，而不是他所说的话。
It caught me totally unprepared. It threw me into a state of confusion. My blood brother, Reginald,in whom I had so much confidence, for whom I had so much respect, the one who had introducedme to the Nation of Islam. I couldn't believe it! And now Islam meant more to me than anything Iever had known in my life. Islam and Mr. Elijah Muhammad had changed my whole world. 
这让我完全措手不及，让我陷入了困惑之中。我的亲兄弟雷金纳德，我对他充满信心，非常尊敬他，是他介绍我加入了“伊斯兰国家”。我无法相信这一切！现在伊斯兰教对我意味着比我一生中所知道的任何事情都更重要。伊斯兰教和伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生改变了我的整个世界。
我了解到，雷金纳德已被伊莱贾·穆罕默德从“伊斯兰民族”组织停职。他没有实行道德约束。雷金纳德在得知真相并接受了真相和穆斯林法律后，仍与当时纽约圣殿的秘书保持不正当关系。其他一些得知此事的穆斯林向芝加哥的穆罕默德先生提出了对雷金纳德的指控，穆罕默德先生已将雷金纳德停职。
When Reginald left, I was in torment. That night, finally, I wrote to Mr. Muhammad, trying todefend my brother, appealing for him. I told him what Reginald was to me, what my brother meantto me. 
当雷金纳德离开时，我感到非常痛苦。那天晚上，我终于写了一封信给穆罕默德先生，试图为我兄弟辩护并请求他。我告诉他雷金纳德对我来说意味着什么，我的兄弟对我意味着什么。
I put the letter into the box for the prison censor. Then all the rest of that night, I prayed to Allah. Idon't think anyone ever prayed more sincerely to Allah. I prayed for some kind of relief from myconfusion. 
我将这封信放进了监狱审查员的邮箱里。那天晚上剩下的时间里，我向阿拉祷告。我想没有人会像我当时那样真诚地向阿拉祷告。我祈求某种解脱，让我从困惑中解脱出来。
It was the next night, as I lay on my bed, I suddenly, with a start, became aware of a man sittingbeside me in my chair. He had on a dark suit. I remember. I could see him as plainly as I seeanyone I look at. He wasn't black, and hewasn't white. He was light-brown-skinned, an Asiaticcast of countenance, and he had oily black hair. 
那天晚上，当我躺在床上时，我突然感到一个穿着深色西装的男人坐在我的椅子上。我记得很清楚，我可以像看到其他人一样清晰地看到他。他既不黑也不白，而是浅棕色皮肤，亚洲人的面容，还有油性的黑色头发。
I looked right into his face. 
我直视着他的脸。
I didn't get frightened. I knew I wasn't dreaming. I couldn't move, I didn't speak, and he didn't. Icouldn't place him racially-other than that I knew he was a non-European. I had no ideawhatsoever who he was. He just sat there. Then, suddenly as he had come, he was gone. 
我并没有感到害怕。我知道这不是在做梦。我无法动弹，无法说话，他也一样。我不知道他的种族，只知道他不是欧洲人。我对他一无所知。他只是坐在那里，然后就像他来时一样突然消失了。
Soon, Mr. Muhammad sent me a reply about Reginald. He wrote, "If you once believed in thetruth, and now you are beginning to doubt the truth, you didn't believe the truth in the first place.What could make you doubt the truth other than your own weak self?" 
不久之后，穆罕默德先生给我回复了有关雷金纳德的事情。他写道：“如果你曾经相信过真相，而现在你开始怀疑真相，那么你从一开始就没有相信过真相。除了你自己软弱的自我，还有什么能让你怀疑真相呢？”
That struck me. Reginald was not leading the disciplined life of a Muslim. And I knew that ElijahMuhammad was right, and my blood brother was wrong. Because right is right, and wrong iswrong. Little did I then realize the day would come when Elijah Muhammad would be accused byhis own sons as being guilty of the same acts of immorality that he judged Reginald and so manyothers for. 
这让我警醒。雷金纳德并没有过着一个穆斯林应有的有纪律的生活。我知道伊莱贾·穆罕默德是对的，而我的血兄弟是错的。因为对就是对，错就是错。那时我并没有意识到有一天伊莱贾·穆罕默德会被自己的儿子指控犯有同样的不道德行为，就像他曾经评判雷金纳德和其他许多人一样。
But at that time, all of the doubt and confusion in my mind was removed. All of the influence thatmy brother had wielded over me was broken. From that day on, as far as I am concerned,everything that my brother Reginald has done is wrong. 
但是，在那个时候，我头脑中的所有疑虑和困惑都消失了。我哥哥对我施加的所有影响都被打破了。从那天起，就我而言，我哥哥雷金纳德所做的一切都是错的。
But Reginald kept visiting me. When he had been a Muslim, he had been immaculate in his attire.But now, he wore things like a T-shirt, shabby-looking trousers, and sneakers. I could see him onthe way down. When he spoke, I heard him coldly. But I would listen. He was my blood brother.Gradually, I saw the chastisement of Allah-what Christians would call "the curse"-come uponReginald. Elijah Muhammad said that Allah was chastising Reginald-and that anyone whochallenged Elijah Muhammad would be chastened by Allah. In Islam we were taught that as longas one didn't know the truth, he lived in darkness. But once the truth was accepted, andrecognized, he lived in light, and whoever would then go against it would be punished by Allah. 
但是，雷金纳德仍然经常来看我。当他还是一个穆斯林时，他的着装总是一丝不苟。但是现在，他穿着T恤衫、破旧的裤子和运动鞋。我能在路上看到他。当他说话时，我听到他的声音很冷淡。但我会听他说话。他是我血兄弟。渐渐地，我看到了安拉的惩罚——基督徒称之为“诅咒”——降临在雷金纳德身上。伊莱贾·穆罕默德说，安拉正在惩罚雷金纳德，任何挑战伊莱贾·穆罕默德的人都会被安拉惩罚。在伊斯兰教中，我们被教导说，只要一个人不知道真相，他的生活就是黑暗的。但是一旦真相被接受并被认可，他的生活就会变得光明，而任何反对它的人都会受到安拉的惩罚。
Mr. Muhammad taught that the five-pointed star stands for justice, and also for the five senses ofman. We were taught that Allah executes justice by working upon the five senses of those whorebel against His Messenger, or against His truth. We were taught that this was Allah's way ofletting Muslims know His sufficiency to defend His Messenger against any and all opposition, aslong as the Messenger himself didn't deviate from the path of truth. We were taught that Allahturned the minds of any defectors into a turmoil. I thought truly that it was Allah doing this to mybrother. 
穆罕默德先生教导我们，五角星代表正义，也代表人类的五种感官。我们被教导说，安拉通过作用于那些反对他的使者或真理的人的五种感官来执行正义。我们被教导说，这是安拉让穆斯林知道他足以保护他的使者免受任何和所有反对的方式，只要使者自己不偏离真相的道路。我们被教导说，安拉将任何叛逃者的思想变成混乱。我真的认为，这是安拉在对我哥哥做这件事。
One letter, I think from my brother Philbert, told me that Reginald was with them in Detroit. I heardno more about Reginald until one day, weeks later, Ella visited me; she told me that Reginald wasat her home in Roxbury, sleeping. Ella said she had heard a knock, she had gone to the door, andthere was Reginald, looking terrible. Ella said she had asked, "Where did you come from?" AndReginald had told her he came from Detroit. She said she asked him, "How did you get here?"And he had told her, "I walked." 
我收到一封信，我想是来自我的兄弟菲尔伯特的，信上告诉我雷金纳德和他们一起在底特律。我再也没有听到有关雷金纳德的消息，直到有一天，几个星期后，埃拉来看我，她告诉我雷金纳德在她位于罗克斯伯里的家里睡觉。埃拉说，她听到有人敲门，走到门口时看到雷金纳德，他看起来很可怕。埃拉问他：“你从哪里来？”雷金纳德告诉她他从底特律来。她说：“你是怎么到这里来的？”他回答说：“我走着来的。”
I believed he _had_ walked. I believed in Elijah Muhammad, and he had convinced us that Allah'schastisement upon Reginald's mind had taken away Reginald's ability to gauge distance andtime. There is a dimension of time with which we are not familiar here in the West. ElijahMuhammad said that under Allah's chastisement, the five senses of a man can be so derangedby thosewhose mental powers are greater than his that in five minutes his hair can turn snowwhite. Or he will walk nine hundred miles as he might walk five blocks. 
我相信他确实是走着来的。我相信伊莱贾·穆罕默德，他让我们相信安拉对雷金纳德头脑的惩罚已经让他失去了衡量距离和时间的能力。在西方，我们并不熟悉时间的一个维度。伊莱贾·穆罕默德说，在安拉的惩罚下，一个人的五种感官可以被那些精神力量比他强大的人所扭曲，以至于在五分钟内他的头发就可以变成雪白色。或者他会像走五街区一样走九百英里。
In prison, since I had become a Muslim, I had grown a beard. When Reginald visited me, henervously moved about in his chair; he told me that each hair on my beard was a snake.Everywhere, he saw snakes. 
在监狱里，自从我成为一个穆斯林以来，我已经长出了胡须。当雷金纳德来看我时，他在椅子上紧张地来回走动；他告诉我我胡须上的每根毛发都是一条蛇。他到处都能看到蛇。
He next began to believe that he was the "Messenger of Allah." Reginald went around in thestreets of Roxbury, Ella reported to me, telling people that he had some divine power. Hegraduated from this to saying that he was Allah. 
他接下来开始相信自己是“安拉的使者”。雷金纳德在罗克斯伯里的街道上走来走去，埃拉告诉我，他告诉人们他有一些神力。他从这里发展到了声称自己是安拉的地步。
He finally began saying he was _greater_ than Allah. 
他最终开始声称自己比安拉更伟大。
Authorities picked up Reginald, and he was put into an institution. They couldn't find what waswrong. They had no way to understand Allah's chastisement. Reginald was released. Then hewas picked up again, and was put into another institution. 
当局逮捕了雷金纳德，将他送进一所机构。他们找不到问题所在。他们无法理解安拉的惩罚。雷金纳德被释放了。然后他又被逮捕并送进了另一所机构。
Reginald is in an institution now. I know where, but I won't say. I would not want to cause him anymore trouble than he has already had. 
雷金纳德现在在一所机构里。我知道他在哪里，但我不打算说出来。我不想给他带来更多的麻烦，他已经遭受了很多。
I believe, today, that it was written, it was meant, for Reginald to be used for one purpose only: asa bait, as a minnow to reach into the ocean of blackness where I was, to save me. 
我相信，今天，这是为了特定的目的而写的，是为了利用雷金纳德：作为一个鱼饵，一个小鱼，进入我所在的黑暗的海洋，来拯救我。
I cannot understand it any other way. 
我无法以其他方式理解它。
After Elijah Muhammad himself was later accused as a very immoral man, I came to believe thatit wasn't a divine chastisement upon Reginald, but the pain he felt when his own family totallyrejected him for Elijah Muhammad, and this hurt made Reginald turn insanely upon ElijahMuhammad.It's impossible to dream, or to see, or to have a vision of someone whom you never have seenbefore-and to see him exactly as he is. To see someone, and to see him exactly as he looks, is tohave a pre-vision. 
当伊莱贾·穆罕默德本人后来被指控为一个非常不道德的人时，我开始相信这并不是对雷金纳德的神圣惩罚，而是当他自己的家人完全因为他支持伊莱贾·穆罕默德而拒绝他时所感受到的痛苦，这种痛苦使雷金纳德疯狂地攻击伊莱贾·穆罕默德。梦想、看到或预见一个从未见过的人是不可能的——看到他的真实面貌更是如此。看到一个人，看到他的真实面貌，是一种预知。
I would later come to believe that my pre-vision was of Master W. D. Fard, the Messiah, the onewhom Elijah Muhammad said had appointed him-Elijah Muhammad-as His Last Messenger to theblack people of North America. 
我后来相信，我的预知是关于大师W.D.法尔的，他是救世主，是伊莱贾·穆罕默德所说的指定他作为他的最后一位使者前往北美黑人的救世主。
*     *     * 
My last year in prison was spent back in the Charlestown Prison. Even among the white inmates,the word had filtered around. Some of those brainwashed black convicts talked too much. And Iknow that the censors had reported on my mail. The Norfolk Prison Colony officials had becomeupset. They used as a reason for my transfer that I refused to take some kind of shots, aninoculation or something. 
我在监狱的最后一年是在查尔斯顿监狱度过的。即使在白人囚犯中，这个词也已经传播开来。一些被洗脑的黑人罪犯说得太多了。我知道审查员已经报告了我的邮件。诺福克监狱殖民地官员变得心烦意乱。他们用我拒绝注射疫苗或其他东西作为我转院的理由。
The only thing that worried me was that I hadn't much time left before I would be eligible forparole-board consideration. But I reasoned that they might look at my representing and spreadingIslam in another way: instead of keeping me in they might want to get me out. 
唯一让我担心的是，在被考虑假释之前，我剩下的时间不多了。但我认为他们可能会以另一种方式看待我的代表和传播伊斯兰教：而不是将我关起来，他们可能希望让我离开。
I had come to prison with 20/20 vision. But when I got sent back to Charlestown, I had read somuch by the lights-out glow in my room at the Norfolk Prison Colony that I had astigmatism andthe first pair of the eyeglasses that I have worn ever since. 
我入狱时视力正常。但是当我被送回查尔斯敦监狱时，我在诺福克监狱居留期间在熄灯后的房间里读了很多书，导致我有散光，这是我一生中第一次戴眼镜。
I had less maneuverability back in the much stricter Charles-town Prison. But I found that a lot ofNegroes attended a Bible class, and I went there. 
我在查尔斯敦监狱的可活动范围更小了，但我发现许多黑人都参加了一个圣经学习班，于是我也去了。
 Conducting the class was a tall, blond, blue-eyed (a perfect "devil") Harvard Seminary student.He lectured, and then he started in a question-and-answer session. I don't know which of us hadread the Bible more, he or I, but I had to give him credit; he really was heavy on his religion. Ipuzzled and puzzled for a way to upset him, and to give those Negroes present something tothink and talk about and circulate. 
授课的是一个高大、金发碧眼（一个完美的“魔鬼”）的哈佛大学学生。他讲授了圣经，然后开始了一个问答环节。我不知道我们两个中谁读圣经更多，但我必须赞扬他：他对宗教真的很虔诚。我想方设法地激怒他，给在场的黑人一些思考、讨论和传播的话题。
Finally, I put up my hand; he nodded. He had talked about Paul. 
最后，我举起手来；他点了点头。他已经讲了保罗的事情。
I stood up and asked, "What color was Paul?" And I kept talking, with pauses, "He had to beblack. . . because he was a Hebrew. . . and the original Hebrews were black. . . weren't they?" 
我站起来问道：“保罗是什么肤色？”我停顿了一下，继续说道：“他必须是黑人。因为他是希伯来人……最初的希伯来人也是黑人……不是吗？”
He had started flushing red. You know the way white people do. He said "Yes." 
他的脸色开始变得通红，就像白人一样。他说“是的”。
I wasn't through yet. "What color was Jesus. . . he was Hebrew, too. . . wasn't he?" 
我还没有说完。“耶稣是什么肤色？他也是希伯来人，不是吗？”
Both the Negro and the white convicts had sat bolt upright. I don't care how tough the convict, behe brainwashed black Christian, or a "devil" white Christian, neither of them is ready to hearanybody saying Jesus wasn't white. The instructor walked around. He shouldn't have felt bad. Inall of the years since, I never have met any intelligent white man who would try to insist thatJesus was white. How could they? He said, "Jesus was brown." 
无论是黑人还是白人囚犯都坐得笔直。我不在乎这些罪犯有多坚强，无论是被洗脑的黑人基督徒还是“魔鬼”白人基督徒，他们都没有准备好听任何人说耶稣不是白人。教练在周围走动。他不应该感到难过。在之后的岁月里，我从未见过任何聪明的白人试图坚持认为耶稣是白人。他们怎么可能呢？他说：“耶稣是棕色的。”
I let him get away with that compromise. 
我让他得逞了，没有再追问。
Exactly as I had known it would, almost overnight the Charlestown convicts, black and white,began buzzing with the story. Wherever I went, I could feel the nodding. And anytime I got achance to exchange words with a blackbrother in stripes, I'd say, "My man! You ever heard aboutsomebody named Mr. Elijah Muhammad?" 
就像我预料的那样，几乎一夜之间，查尔斯顿的黑人和白人囚犯开始传播这个故事。无论我走到哪里，我都能感觉到他们的点头。每当我有机会和一个穿着条纹囚服的黑人兄弟交谈时，我会说：“我的伙计！你听说过一个名叫伊莱贾·穆罕默德的人吗？”
CHAPTER TW ELVE 
第十三章：第十二篇
SAVIOR 
救世主
During the spring of nineteen fifty-two I joyously wrote Elijah Muhammad and my family that theMassachusetts State Parole Board had voted that I should be released. But still a few monthswere taken up with the red tape delay of paper work that went back and forth, arranging for myparole release in the custody of my oldest brother, Wilfred, in Detroit, who now managed afurniture store. Wilfred got the Jew who owned the store to sign a promise that upon release Iwould be given immediate employment. 
在1952年春天，我高兴地给伊莱贾·穆罕默德和我的家人写信说，马萨诸塞州假释委员会已经投票决定我应该被释放了。但是几个月过去了，由于文书工作的拖延，文件往返不断，最终安排我在哥哥威尔弗雷德的监护下获得假释，他当时在底特律经营一家家具店。威尔弗雷德让店主签署了一份承诺书，保证一旦我获得假释，就会立即给我找到工作。
By the prison system wire, I heard that Shorty also was up for parole. But Shorty was havingtrouble getting some reputable person to sign for him. (Later, I found out that in prison Shorty hadstudied musical composition. He had even progressed to writing some pieces; one of them I knowhe named "The Bastille Concerto. ") 
通过监狱系统的线报，我听说Shorty也获得了假释。但是Shorty在找到一些有声望的人为他签署承诺书时遇到了麻烦。（后来我发现，在监狱里Shorty学习了音乐作曲。他甚至已经写出了一些作品；我知道其中一首他命名为《巴士底交响曲》）
My going to Detroit instead of back to Harlem or Boston was influenced by my family's feelingexpressed in their letters. Especially my sister Hilda had stressed to me that although I felt Iunderstood Elijah Muhammad's teachings, I had much to learn, and I ought to come to Detroitand become a member of a temple of practicing Muslims. 
我去底特律而不是回到哈莱姆或波士顿，受到了我家人在信中表达的情感的影响。特别是我的姐姐希尔达强调告诉我，尽管我觉得我理解了伊莱贾·穆罕默德的教导，但我还有很多要学习的，我应该来底特律成为实践穆斯林的寺庙成员。
It was in August when they gave me a lecture, a cheap Li'l Abner suit, and a small amount ofmoney, and I walked out of the gate. I never looked back, butthat doesn't make me any differentfrom a million inmates who have left a prison behind them. 
那是在八月，他们给了我一次演讲，一件廉价的小班纳西装，和一小笔钱，然后我走出了大门。我从未回头，但这并不使我与成千上万离开监狱的囚犯有什么不同。
The first stop I made was at a Turkish bath. I got some of that physical feeling of prison-taintsteamed off me. Ella, with whom I stayed only overnight, had also agreed that it would be best forme to start again in Detroit. The police in a new city wouldn't have it in for me; that was Ella'sconsideration-not the Muslims, for whom Ella had no use. Both Hilda and Reginald had tried towork on Ella. But Ella, with her strong will, didn't go for it at all. She told me that she felt anyonecould be whatever he wanted to be, Holy Roller, Seventh Day Adventist, or whatever it was, butshe wasn't going to become any Muslim. 
我第一站去了一家土耳其浴室，蒸气将监狱中的污垢带走了一些，我感觉焕然一新。我和艾拉只待了一晚，她也认为我最好在底特律重新开始。在新城市里，警察不会对我有什么意见；这是艾拉考虑过的，而不是对穆斯林，因为艾拉对他们没有什么用处。希尔达和雷金纳德都试图说服艾拉，但艾拉有着坚定的意志，根本不听。她告诉我，她觉得任何人都可以成为他想成为的任何人，圣罗勒教徒、七日节派教徒或其他什么，但她不会成为任何穆斯林。
Hilda, the next morning, gave me some money to put in my pocket. Before I left, I went out andbought three things I remember well. I bought a better-looking pair of eyeglasses than the pair theprison had issued to me; and I bought a suitcase and a wrist watch. 
第二天早上，希尔达给了我一些钱放进口袋里。在我离开之前，我出去买了三样东西，我记得很清楚。我买了一副比监狱发给我的好看得多的眼镜；还买了一个行李箱和一块手表。
I have thought, since, that without fully knowing it, I was preparing for what my life was about tobecome. Because those are three things I've used more than anything else. My eyeglassescorrect the astigmatism that I got from all the reading in prison. I travel so much now that my wifekeeps alternate suitcases packed so that, when necessary, I can just grab o ne. And you won't findanybody more time-conscious than I am . I live by my watch, keeping appointments. Even whenI'm using my car, I drive by my watch, not my speedometer. Time is more important to me thandistance. 
我想，从那时起，即使没有完全意识到，我也在为未来的生活做准备。因为那三样东西是我使用最多的。我的眼镜纠正了我在监狱里读书时产生的散光。现在我旅行很多，所以我妻子会随时准备好备用行李，这样我就可以随时随地出发。你也不会发现比我更注重时间的人了。我靠手表生活，准时赴约。即使开车的时候，我也是根据手表而不是速度表来驾驶。对我来说，时间比距离更重要。
I caught a bus to Detroit. The furniture store that my brother Wilfred managed was right in theblack ghetto of Detroit; I'd better not name the store, if I'm going to tell the way they robbedNegroes. Wilfred introduced me to the Jews who owned the store. And, as agreed, I was put towork, as a salesman. 
我坐公共汽车去了底特律。我哥哥威尔弗雷德经营的家具店位于底特律的黑人区，我最好不要说出这家店的名字，如果要讲述他们如何抢劫黑人的话。威尔弗雷德把我介绍给了拥有这家商店的犹太人。按照约定，我被安排在店里工作，担任销售员。
 "Nothing Down" advertisements drew poor Negroes into that store like flypaper. It was a shame,the way they paid three and four times what the furniture had cost, because they could get creditfrom those Jews. It was the same kind of cheap, gaudy-looking junk that you can see in any ofthe black ghetto furniture stores today. Fabrics were stapled on the sofas. Imitation "leopard skin"bedspreads, "tiger skin" rugs, such stuff as that. I would see clumsy, work-hardened, callousedhands scrawling and scratching signatures on the contract, agreeing to highway-robbery interestrates in the fine print that never was read. 
“Nothing Down”广告吸引了贫穷的黑人像苍蝇一样进入那家商店。令人感到遗憾的是，他们以家具价格的三四倍支付，因为他们可以从那些犹太人那里获得信贷。这是今天在任何一个黑人贫民窟家具商店都可以看到的那种廉价而俗气的垃圾。沙发是用钉板固定的。仿制的豹皮床罩、虎皮地毯等等。我会看到笨拙、工作过度、长满老茧的手在合同上涂写和划伤签名，同意高利贷利率，而这些细节永远不会被阅读。
I was seeing in real life the same point made in a joke that during the 1964 Presidential campaign_Jet_ magazine reported that Senator Barry Goldwater had told somewhere. It was that a whiteman, a Negro, and a Jew were given one wish each. The white man asked for securities; theNegro asked for a lot of money; the Jew asked for some imitation jewelry "and that colored boy'saddress." 
我在现实生活中看到了一个笑话中所提出的同样的观点。《杰特》杂志报道，在1964年的总统竞选期间，参议员巴里·戈德华特在某个地方说过这样的话：一个白人、一个黑人和一个犹太人每人只有一个愿望。白人要证券；黑人要很多钱；犹太人要一些仿制的珠宝和那个有色男孩的地址。
In all my years in the streets, I'd been looking at the exploitation that for the first time I really sawand understood. Now I watched brothers entwining themselves in the economic clutches of thewhite man who went home every night with another bag of the money drained out of the ghetto. Isaw that the money, instead of helping the black man, was going to help enrich these whitemerchants, who usually lived in an "exclusive" area where a black man had better not get caughtunless he worked there for somebody white. 
在我在街上的那些年里，我一直在观察着被剥削的现象，这是我第一次真正看到和理解这种现象。现在，我看到兄弟们把自己卷入了白人的经济束缚中，而白人每天晚上回家时都会带着另一袋从贫民窟中榨取的钱。我意识到这些钱并没有帮助黑人，而是帮助了那些富有的白人商人，他们通常住在一个“排外”的地区，除非黑人为白人工作，否则最好不要在那里被发现。
Wilfred invited me to share his home, and gratefully I accepted. The warmth of a home and afamily was a healing change from the prison cage for me. It would deeply move almost any newlyfreed convict, I think. But especially this Muslim home's atmosphere sent me often to my knees topraise Allah. My family's letters while I was in prison had included a description of the Muslimhome routine, but to truly appreciate it, one had to be a part of the routine. Each act,and thesignificance of that act, was gently, patiently explained to me by my brother Wilfred. 
威尔弗雷德邀请我分享他的家，我感激地接受了。家的温暖和家庭对我来说是一种治愈，与监狱牢笼不同。我想这对任何刚获释的罪犯都会深深地感动他们。但特别是这个穆斯林家庭的氛囄经常让我跪拜向安拉祈祷。在我狱中时，我的家人给我写信描述了穆斯林家庭的日常生活，但要真正欣赏它，一个人必须成为日常的一部分。我的兄弟威尔弗雷德耐心地向我解释每一项行动及其意义。
There was none of the morning confusion that exists in most homes. Wilfred, the father, the familyprotector and provider, was the first to rise. "The father prepares the way for his family," he said.He, then I, performed the morning ablutions. Next came Wilfred's wife, Ruth, and then theirchildren, so that orderliness prevailed in the use of the bathroom. 
那里没有大多数家庭中存在的早晨的混乱。威尔弗雷德，这个家庭的保护者和提供者，是第一个起床的人。“父亲为家人做好准备，”他说。然后是我，我们进行了早晨的洗漱。接下来是威尔弗雷德的妻子露丝，然后是他们的孩子，所以使用浴室的顺序很有规律。
"In the name of Allah, I perform the ablution," the Muslim said aloud before washing first the righthand, then the left hand. The teeth were thoroughly brushed, followed by three rinsings of themouth. The nostrils were also rinsed out thrice. A shower then completed the whole body'spurification in readiness for prayer. 
“以安拉的名义，我进行洗漱，”这个穆斯林在先洗右手后洗左手之前大声说。他把牙齿彻底刷干净，然后漱口三次。鼻孔也被冲洗了三次。接着，他洗了个澡，完成了全身净化，准备做礼拜。
Each family member, even children upon meeting each other for that new day's first time, greetedsoftly and pleasantly, "As-Salaam-Alaikum" (the Arabic for "Peace be unto you"). "Wa-Alaikum- Salaam" ("and unto you be peace") was the other's reply. Over and over again, the Muslim said inhis own mind, "Allahu-Akbar, Allahu-Akbar" ("Allah is the greatest"). 
每个家庭成员，即使是第一次见面的孩子，在见到彼此时都会轻声友好地问候：“As-Salaam-Alaikum”（阿拉伯语中的“愿你平安”），“Wa-Alaikum-Salaam”（“愿你平安”）是对方的回答。穆斯林一遍又一遍地在心里说：“Allahu-Akbar，Allahu-Akbar”（“阿拉是最伟大的”）。
The prayer rug was spread by Wilfred while the rest of the family purified themselves. It wasexplained to me that a Muslim family prayed with the sun near the horizon. If that time wasmissed, the prayer had to be deferred until the sun was beyond the horizon. "Muslims are notsun-worshipers. We pray facing the East to be in unity with the rest of our 725 million brothersand sisters in the entire Muslim world." 
威尔弗雷德在家人净化自己的时候铺好了祷告垫。我被告知穆斯林家庭在日落时祈祷。如果错过了这个时间，祈祷就必须推迟到太阳完全落下之后。“穆斯林不是太阳崇拜者。我们面向东方祈祷，与整个穆斯林世界中7.25亿兄弟姐妹团结一致。”
All the family, in robes, lined up facing East. In unison, we stepped from our slippers to stand onthe prayer rug. 
全家人都穿上了长袍，排成一列面向东方。我们齐步从拖鞋上走到祷告垫上。
 Today, I say with my family in the Arabic tongue the prayer which I first learned in English: "Iperform the morning prayer to Allah, the Most High, Allah is the greatest. Glory to Thee Oh Allah,Thine is the praise, Blessed is Thy Name, and Exalted is Thy Majesty. I bear witness that nothingdeserves to be served or worshiped besides Thee." 
今天，我和家人一起用阿拉伯语说出了我最初用英语学习的祷告：“我向至高无上的安拉（Allah）做晨礼。安拉是最伟大的。哦，安拉啊，荣耀归于你，赞美归于你，祝福归于你的名字，尊贵归于你的威严。我作证除了你之外，没有什么值得被侍奉或崇拜。”
No solid food, only juice a nd coffee, was taken for our breakfasts. Wilfred and I went off to work.There, at noon and again at around three in the afternoon, unnoticed by others in the furniturestore, we would rinse our hands, faces and mouths, and softly meditate. 
我们的早餐只喝了果汁和咖啡，没有固体食物。威尔弗雷德和我去了工作。在那里，在中午和下午三点左右，在家具店里不被其他人注意到的时候，我们会洗手、洗脸和漱口，然后轻轻地冥想。
Muslim children did likewise at school, and Muslim wives and mothers interrupted their chores tojoin t he world's 725 million Muslims in communicating with God. 
穆斯林儿童在学校也是如此，穆斯林的妻子和母亲也会中断家务，与全世界7.25亿穆斯林一起与真主沟通。
*     *     * 
Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays were the meeting days of the relatively small Detroit TempleNumber One. Near the temple, which actually was a storefront, were three hog-slaughteringpens. The squealing of hogs being slaughtered filtered into our Wednesday and Friday meetings.I'm describing the condition that we Muslims were in back in the early  1950's. 
星期三、星期五和星期日是规模相对较小的第一底特律寺的聚会日。寺庙实际上是一家店面，附近有三家屠宰场。被宰杀的生猪发出的尖叫声渗入了我们星期三和星期五的聚会中。我正在描述20世纪50年代初我们穆斯林所处的境况。
The address of Temple Number One was 1470 Frederick Street, I think. The first Temple to beformed, back in 1931, by Master W. D. Fard, was formed in Detroit, Michigan. I never had seenany Christian-believing Negroes conduct themselves like the Muslims, the individuals and thefamilies alike. The men were quietly, tastefully dressed. The women wore ankle-length gowns, nomakeup, and scarves covered their heads. The neat children were mannerly not only to adults butto other children as well. 
第一座寺庙的地址是Frederick街1470号，我想。回到1931年，由W. D. Fard大师创立的第一座寺庙在密歇根州的底特律成立。我从未见过任何信奉基督教的黑人像穆斯林人一样，无论是个人还是家庭都是这样。男人穿着得体，举止文雅。女人穿着到脚踝的长袍，没有化妆，头戴着围巾。孩子们不仅对成年人有礼貌，而且对其他孩子也是如此。
  I had never dreamed of anything like that atmosphere among black people who had learned tobe proud they were black, who had learned to love other black people instead of being jealousand suspicious. I thrilled to how we Muslim men used both hands to grasp a black brother's bothhands, voicing and smiling our happiness to meet him again. The Muslim sisters, both marriedand single, were given an honor and respect that I'd never seen black men give to their women,and it felt wonderful to me. The salutations which we all exchanged were warm, filled with mutualrespect and dignity: "Brother". . . "Sister". . . "Ma'am". . . "Sir." Even children speaking to otherchildren used these terms. Beautiful! 
我从未想过在那些学会了为自己的黑色感到自豪，学会了爱其他黑人而不是嫉妒和怀疑的黑人中会有这样的氛围。我为穆斯林男子用双手紧握着另一个黑人兄弟的双手而感到兴奋，表达着再次见到他的喜悦。无论是已婚还是单身的穆斯林姐妹都受到了我曾经从未见过的黑人男子给予她们的尊重和荣誉，这对我来说感觉很棒。我们互相问候时都很热情，充满着相互尊重和尊严：“兄弟”……“姐妹”……“夫人”……“先生”。甚至孩子们也用这些称呼与其他孩子交谈。太美了！
Lemuel Hassan then was the Minister at Temple Number One. "As-Salaikum," he greeted us."Wa-Salaikum," we returned. Minister Lemuel stood before us, near a blackboard. Theblackboard had fixed upon it in permanent paint, on one side, the United States flag and under itthe words "Slavery, Suffering and Death," then the word "Christianity" alongside the sign of theCross. Beneath the Cross was a painting of a black man hanged from a tree. On the other sidewas painted what we were taught was the Muslim flag, the crescent and star on a red backgroundwith the words "Islam: Freedom, Justice, Equality," and beneath that "Which One Will Survive theWar of Armageddon?" 
莱缪尔·哈桑当时是第一底特律寺庙的部长。“As-Salaikum，”他向我们问候。”Wa-Salaikum，”我们回应道。部长莱缪尔站在我们面前，靠近一块黑板。黑板上固定着永久的颜料，一侧是美国国旗，下面是“奴隶制、苦难和死亡”，然后是十字架上的基督教标志。十字架下面是一个被钉在树上的黑人的画像。另一侧是我们被教导的穆斯林旗帜，红色背景下的新月和星星，上面写着“伊斯兰教：自由、公正、平等”，下面写着“谁将在末日之战中幸存？”
For more than an hour, Minister Lemuel lectured about Elijah Muhammad's teachings. I sat raptlyabsorbing Minister Lemuel's every syllable and gesture. Frequently, he graphically illustratedpoints by chalking key words or phrases on the blackboard. 
莱缪尔部长讲了一个小时多关于伊利亚·穆罕穆德的教义。我全神贯注地坐着，吸收着莱缪尔部长的每一个音节和手势。他经常用粉笔在黑板上画下关键词或短语来生动地说明观点。
I thought it was outrageous that our small temple still had some empty seats. I complained to mybrother Wilfred that there should be no empty seats, with the surrounding streets full of ourbrainwashed black brothers and sisters, drinking, cursing, fighting, dancing, carousing, and usingdope-the very thingsthat Mr. Muhammad taught were helping the black man to stay under theheel of the white man here in America. 
我觉得很奇怪，我们这个小寺庙里还有空位。我向我的哥哥威尔弗雷德抱怨说不应该有空位，因为我们周围的人群里充满了被洗脑的黑人兄弟姐妹，他们喝酒、咒骂、打架、跳舞、狂欢，使用毒品——正是穆罕默德先生所教导的东西帮助黑人在美国牢牢地踩在白人的脚底下。
From what I could gather, the recruitment attitude at the temple seemed to me to amount to aself-defeating waiting view . . . an assumption that Allah would bring us more Muslims. I felt thatAllah would be more inclined to help those who helped themselves. I had lived for years in ghettostreets; I knew the Negroes in those streets. Harlem or Detroit were no different. I said Idisagreed, that I thought we should go out into the streets and get more Muslims into the fold. Allof my life, as you know, I had been an activist, I had been impatient. My brother Wilfredcounseled me to keep patience. And for me to be patient was made easier by the fact that I couldanticipate soon seeing and perhaps meeting the man who was called "The Messenger," ElijahMuhammad himself. 
据我所知，在我看来，寺庙里的招募态度相当于一种自我挫败的等待观点。假设安拉会给我们带来更多的穆斯林。我觉得安拉会更倾向于帮助那些自助的人。我在贫民区的街道上生活了很多年。我认识那些街上的黑人。哈莱姆和底特律也不例外。我说我不同意，我认为我们应该走上街头，让更多的穆斯林加入进来。正如你们所知，在我的一生中，我一直是一个激进分子，我一直没有耐心。我哥哥威尔弗雷德劝告我要保持耐心。对我来说，耐心变得更容易了，因为我很快就能看到，也许还能见到被称为“信使”的伊利亚·穆罕默德本人。
Today, I have appointments with world-famous personages, including some heads of nations. ButI looked forward to the Sunday before Labor Day in 1952 with an eagerness never sinceduplicated. Detroit Temple Number One Muslims were going in a motor caravan-I think about tenautomobiles-to visit Chicago Temple Number Two, to hear Elijah Muhammad. 
今天，我与一些世界知名人士有约，包括一些国家元首
Not since childhood had I been so excited as when we drove in Wilfred's car. At great Muslimrallies since then I have seen, and heard, and felt ten thousand black people applauding andcheering. But on that Sunday afternoon when our two little temples assembled, perhaps only twohundred Muslims, the Chicagoans welcoming and greeting us Detroiters, I experienced tinglingsup my spine as I've never had since. 
从童年起，我从未像那次和威尔弗雷德一起开车去芝加哥第二座寺庙听他讲课时那样兴奋。在后来的许多穆斯林集会上，我见过、听过、感受过成千上万的黑人鼓掌欢呼。但是那个周日下午，当我们两个小寺庙的人聚集在一起时，也许只有两百名穆斯林，芝加哥人欢迎我们底特律人，我感到我的脊椎发麻，这是我从未有过的感觉。
I was totally unprepared for the Messenger Elijah Muhammad's physical impact upon myemotions. From the rear of Temple Number Two, he came toward the platform. The small,sensitive, gentle, brown face that I had studied in photographs, until I had dreamed about it, wasfixed straight ahead as the Messengerstrode, encircled by the marching, strapping Fruit of Islamguards. The Messenger, compared to them, seemed fragile, almost tiny. He and the Fruit of Islamwere dressed in dark suits, white shirts, and bow ties. The Messenger wore a gold-embroideredfez. 
我完全没有准备好面对先知伊利亚·穆罕穆德对我情绪的物理冲击。他从第二座寺庙的后面走来，走向讲台。在我梦中反复研究过的那张小而敏感、温柔、棕色的脸庞，直视着我，随着先知的走动，被迈着有力步伐的果伊斯兰教徒守卫所包围。与他们相比，先知显得脆弱，几乎微不足道。他和果伊斯兰教徒都穿着深色西装、白色衬衫和蝴蝶结领带。先知戴着一顶绣有金线的费兹。
I stared at the great man who had taken the time to write to me when I was a convict whom heknew nothing about. He was the man whom I had been told had spent years of his life in sufferingand sacrifice to lead us, the black people, because he loved us so much. And then, hearing hisvoice, I sat leaning forward, riveted upon his words. (I try to reconstruct what Elijah Muhammadsaid from having since heard him speak hundreds of times.) 
我盯着这个伟大的人，他曾经花时间写信给我这个他一无所知的囚犯。他是那个我曾经被告知花费了多年生命在痛苦和牺牲中引领我们黑人的人，因为他如此地爱我们。然后，听到他的声音，我坐得向前倾斜，全神贯注地倾听着他的话语。（我试着从之后听到他说数百次中重构伊利亚·穆罕穆德所说的话。）
"I have not stopped one day for the past twenty-one years. I have been standing, preaching toyou throughout those past twenty-one years, while I was free, and even while I was in bondage. Ispent three and one-half years in the federal penitentiary, and also over a year in the city jail forteaching this truth. I was also deprived of a father's love for his family for seven long years while Iwas running from hypocrites and other enemies of this word and revelation of God-which will givelife to you, and put you on the same level with all other civilized and independent nations andpeoples of this planet earth. . . ." 
“在过去的21年里，我没有一天停止过。我一直站着，在那些过去的日子里向你传道，当我是自由的，甚至是在我被奴役的时候。我在联邦监狱度过了三个半月，还有一年多的时间在城市监狱里教授这个真理。我还被剥夺了父亲对他的家人七年的爱，当我在逃避伪君子和上帝的启示的敌人时-这将会赋予你们生命，并将你们置于与地球上所有其他文明和独立国家和人民的同一水平上......”
Elijah Muhammad spoke of how in this wilderness of North America, for centuries the "blue-eyeddevil white man" had brainwashed the "so-called Negro." He told us how, as one result, the blackman in America was "mentally, morally and spiritually dead." Elijah Muhammad spoke of how theblack man was Original Man, who had been kidnapped from his homeland and stripped of hislanguage, his culture, his family structure, his family name, until the black man in America did noteven realize who he was. 
伊利亚·穆罕穆德谈到了在北美的荒野中，几个世纪以来“蓝眼睛的魔鬼白人”如何洗脑“所谓的黑人”。他告诉我们，结果之一是美国的黑人“在精神、道德和灵性上已经死亡”。伊利亚·穆罕穆德谈到了黑人是原始人，他们被从家乡绑架并剥夺了他们的语言、文化、家庭结构和姓氏，直到美国的黑人甚至不意识到自己是谁。
He told us, and showed us, how his teachings of the true knowledge of ourselves would lift up theblack man from the bottom of the white man's societyand place the black man where he hadbegun, at the top of civilization. 
他告诉我们，并展示了他的教导，即关于我们自己的真正知识将如何从白人社会的底层提升黑人，并将黑人放在他开始的地方，在文明的顶端。
Concluding, pausing for breath, he called my name. 
最后，他停顿了一下，叫了我的名字。
It was like an electrical shock. Not looking at me directly, he asked me to stand. 
这就像是电击一样。他没有直接看着我，而是让我站起来。
He told them that I was just out of prison. He said how "strong" I had been while in prison. "Everyday," he said, "for years, Brother Malcolm has written a letter from prison to me. And I havewritten to him as often as I could." 
他告诉他们，我刚刚出狱。他说我在监狱里是多么“坚强”。“每天”，他说，“多年来，马尔科姆兄弟一直在监狱里给我写信。我也尽可能地回信。”
Standing there, feeling the eyes of the two hundred Muslims upon me, I heard him make aparable about me. 
站在那里，感受着这两百个穆斯林的目光，我听到他谈到了我。
When God bragged about how faithful Job was, said Elijah Muhammad, the devil said only God'shedge around Job kept Job so faithful. "Remove that protective hedge," the devil told God, "and Iwill make Job curse you to your face." 
当上帝吹嘘约伯是多么忠诚时，伊莱贾·穆罕穆德说，魔鬼说只有上帝对约伯的护卫才能让约伯如此忠诚。“移除那道保护屏障，”魔鬼告诉上帝，“我就能让约伯当面诅咒你。”
The devil could claim that, hedged in prison, I had just used Islam, Mr. Muhammad said. But thedevil would say that now, out of prison, I would return to my drinking, smoking, dope, and life ofcrime. 
穆罕穆德先生说道，魔鬼可以说，在监狱里被护卫着的我，只是利用了伊斯兰教。但是，现在，出了监狱，我会回到我的酗酒、吸烟、吸毒和犯罪的生活中去。
"Well, now, our good brother Malcolm's hedge is removed and we will see how he does," Mr.Muhammad said. "I believe that he is going to remain faithful." 
“好的，现在我们的好兄弟马尔科姆的护卫被移除了，我们将看到他的表现，”穆罕穆德先生说。“我相信他会继续忠诚。”
And Allah blessed me to remain true, firm and strong in my faith in Islam, despite many severetrials to my faith. And even when events produced a crisis between Elijah Muhammad and me, Itold him at the beginning of the crisis, with all the sincerity I had in me, that I still believed in himmore strongly than he believed in himself.Mr. Muhammad and I are not together today only because of envy and jealousy. I had more faithin Elijah Muhammad than I could ever have in any other man upon this earth. 
安拉祝福我，让我在伊斯兰教中保持忠诚、坚定和强大，尽管我的信仰经历了许多严峻的考验。即使当事件在伊莱贾·穆罕穆德和我之间造成危机时，我也告诉他，在这个危机开始时，我用我内心所有真诚的话告诉他，我仍然比他更坚信他的教义。穆罕穆德先生和我今天不在一起，仅仅是因为嫉妒和嫉妒。我对伊莱贾·穆罕穆德的信仰比我对这个世界上任何其他人的信仰都要坚定。
You will remember my having said that, when I was in prison, Mr. Muhammad would be mybrother Wilfred's house guest whenever he visited Detroit Temple Number One. Every Muslimsaid that never could you do as much for Mr. Muhammad as he would do for you in return. ThatSunday, after the meeting, he invited our entire family group and Minister Lemuel Hassan to behis guests for dinner that evening, at his new home. 
你会记得我曾说过，当我在监狱里时，穆罕穆德先生将是他的兄弟威尔弗雷德每次访问第一底特律教堂时的客人。每个穆斯林都说你永远不能为穆罕穆德先生做这么多，他会以同样的方式回报你。那个星期天，会议结束后，他邀请了我们整个家族和莱缪尔·哈桑部长成为他当晚在新家的客人共进晚餐。
Mr. Muhammad said that his children and his followers had insisted that he move into this larger,better eighteen-room house in Chicago at 4847 Woodlawn Avenue. They had just moved in thatweek, I believe. When we arrived, Mr. Muhammad showed us where he had just been painting. Ihad to restrain my impulse to run and bring a chair for the Messenger of Allah. Instead, as I hadheard he would do, he was worrying about my comfort. 
穆罕穆德先生说，他的孩子和追随者坚持要他搬到芝加哥伍德罗伊大道4847号的这个更大的、更好的18个房间的房子里。我相信他们是在上周刚刚搬进去的。当我们到达时，穆罕穆德先生带我们看他刚刚油漆过的地方。我不得不抑制住冲动，跑过去拿一把椅子给真主的信使。相反，正如我听说他会做的那样，他担心我的舒适。
We had hoped to hear his wisdom during the dinner, but instead he encouraged us to talk. I satthinking of how our Detroit Temple more or less just sat and awaited Allah to bring converts-and,beyond that, of the millions of black people all over America, who never had heard of theteachings that could stir and wake and resurrect the black man. . . and there at Mr. Muhammad'stable, I found my tongue. I have always been one to speak my mind. 
我们本来希望在晚餐时听到他的智慧，但他却鼓励我们谈话。我坐在那里思考着我们的底特律寺庙是如何几乎只是坐着等待真主带来皈依者，以及除了这些之外，还有数以百万计的从未听说过能够激励和唤醒黑人教义的全美黑人。而在穆罕穆德先生的餐桌上，我找到了自己的话语。我一直是一个直言不讳的人。
During a conversational lull, I asked Mr. Muhammad how many Muslims were supposed to be inour Temple Number One in Detroit. 
在一次谈话的间歇，我问穆罕穆德先生底特律第一座教堂里应该有多少穆斯林。
He said, "There are supposed to be thousands." 
他说：“应该有数千人。”
 "Yes, sir," I said. "Sir, what is your opinion of the best way of getting thousands there?" 
“是的，先生，”我说。 “先生，您认为最好的方法是什么让人们来到那里？”
"Go after the young people," he said. "Once you get them, the older ones will follow throughshame." 
“去追求年轻人，”他说。 “一旦你得到了他们，年长的人也会跟着来以挽回他们的羞耻感。”
I made up my mind that we were going to follow that advice. 
我下定决心，我们要遵循这个建议。
Back in Detroit, I talked with my brother Wilfred. I offered my services to our Temple's Minister,Lemuel Hassan. He shared my determination that we should apply Mr. Muhammad's formula in arecruitment drive. Beginning that day, every evening, straight from work at the furniture store, Iwent doing what we Muslims later came to call "fishing." I knew the thinking and the language ofghetto streets: "My man, let me pull your coat to something-" 
回到底特律，我和我的兄弟威尔弗雷德交谈了。我向底特律第一座教堂的部长莱缪尔·哈桑提供了我的服务。他和我一样决心在招募活动中应用穆罕穆德先生的公式。从那天开始，每天晚上，我从家具店下班后直接去“钓鱼”。我知道ghetto街道上的想法和语言：“老兄，让我把你的外套拉到某处-”
My application had, of course, been made and during this time I received from Chicago my "X."The Muslim's "X" symbolized the true African family name that he never could know. For me, my"X" replaced the white slavemaster name of "Little" which some blue-eyed devil named Little hadimposed upon my paternal forebears. The receipt of my "X" meant that forever after in the nationof Islam, I would be known as Malcolm X. Mr. Muhammad taught that we would keep this "X" untilGod Himself returned and gave us a Holy Name from His own mouth. 
当然，我已经提交了申请，在此期间，我从芝加哥收到了我的“X”。穆斯林的“X”象征着他永远无法知道的真正的非洲姓氏。对我来说，我的“X”取代了白人奴隶主的“小”名字，这个蓝眼睛的恶魔名叫“小”，强加给我的祖先。收到我的“X”意味着在伊斯兰国家中，我将被永远称为马尔科姆·X。穆罕穆德先生教导我们要保持这个“X”，直到上帝亲自回来并从他自己的口中赐予我们一个神圣的名字。
Recruit as I would in the Detroit ghetto bars, in the poolrooms, and on the corners, I found mypoor, ignorant, brainwashed black brothers mostly too deaf, dumb, and blind, mentally, morally,and spiritually, to respond. It angered me that only now and then would one display even a littlecuriosity about the teachings that would resurrect the black man. 
就像我在底特律ghetto酒吧、台球厅和街角所做的那样，我招募了我的可怜的、无知的、被洗脑的黑兄弟们，他们大多数人在心理、道德和精神上都很聋、哑、盲，无法回应。令我愤怒的是，只有偶尔会有人对能够唤醒黑人的教义表现出一点好奇心。
These few I would almost beg to visit Temple Number One at our next meeting. But then not halfof those who agreed to come would actually show up. 
这些少数人我几乎恳求在我们下一次会面时来参观我们的第一座寺庙。但是，然后不是一半同意来的人实际上会出现。
Gradually, enough were made interested, though, that each month, a few more automobileslengthened our caravans to Temple Two in Chicago. But even after seeing and hearing ElijahMuhammad in person, only a few of the interested visitors would apply by formal letter to Mr.Muhammad to be accepted for Nation of Islam membership. 
不过，渐渐地，足够多的人对加入感兴趣了，每个月都有更多的人加入到我们的车队中，把车开到芝加哥的第二座寺庙。但是，即使亲眼见到和听到了伊莱贾·穆罕穆德本人，只有少数感兴趣的访客会正式写信给穆罕穆德先生，申请被接受为伊斯兰国家的成员。
With a few months of plugging away, however, our storefront Temple One about tripled itsmembership. And that so deeply pleased Mr. Muhammad that he paid us the honor of a personalvisit. 
然而，几个月的努力工作后，我们位于第一座寺庙的店面成员数量增加了两倍。这深深地让穆罕穆德先生感到高兴，他亲自光临了我们的店面。
Mr. Muhammad gave me warm praise when Minister Lemuel Hassan told how hard I had laboredin the cause of Islam. 
当莱缪尔·哈桑部长告诉我在伊斯兰事业中所做出的努力时，穆罕穆德先生给予了我热情的赞扬。
Our caravans grew. I remember with what pride we led twenty-five automobiles to Chicago. Andeach time we went, we were honored with dinner at the home of Elijah Muhammad. He wasinterested in my potential, I could tell from things he would say. 
我们的车队越来越大。我记得我们自豪地带领着25辆汽车前往芝加哥。每次去的时候，我们都在伊莱贾·穆罕穆德的家中受到款待。我可以从他说的话中看出他的兴趣和潜力。
And I worshiped him. 
我崇拜他。
In early 1953, 1 left the furniture store. I earned a little better weekly pay check working at the GarWood factory in Detroit, where big garbage truck bodies were made. I cleaned up behind thewelders each time they finished another truck body. 
1953年初，我离开了家具店。我在底特律的GarWood工厂工作，每周薪水稍微高一点，那里制造大型垃圾车体。每次焊工完成一个车体后，我就清理他们留下的工作现场。
Mr. Muhammad was saying at his dining table by this time that one of his worst needs was moreyoung men willing to work as hard as they would have to in order to bear the responsibilities ofhis ministers. He was saying that the teachings should be spreading further than they had, andtemples needed to be established in other cities. 
这时穆罕穆德先生在餐桌上说，他最需要的是更多愿意像必须的那样努力工作的年轻男子来承担他的部长们的责任。他说，教义应该被传播得更远，在其他城市建立更多的寺庙。
It simply had never occurred to me that / might be a minister. I had never felt remotely qualified todirectly represent Mr. Muhammad. If someone had asked me about becoming a minister, I wouldhave been astonished, and told them I was happy and willing to serve Mr. Muhammad in thelowliest capacity. 
我从未想过自己可能成为一位部长。我从未觉得自己有丝毫资格直接代表穆罕穆德先生。如果有人问我是否想成为一位部长，我会感到非常惊讶，并告诉他们我很高兴并愿意在最低限度上为穆罕穆德先生服务。
I don't know if Mr. Muhammad suggested it or if our Temple One Minister Lemuel Hassan on hisown decision encouraged me to address our assembled brothers and sisters. I know that Itestified to what Mr. Muhammad's teachings had done for me: "If I told you the life  I have lived,you would find it hard to believe me. . . . W hen I say something about the white man, I am nottalking about someone I don't know. . . ." 
我不知道穆罕穆德先生是否建议我这样做，还是我们第一座寺庙的部长莱缪尔·哈桑自行决定鼓励我向聚集在一起的兄弟姐妹发表演讲。我知道我证明了穆罕穆德先生的教导对我做了什么：“如果我告诉你们我所过的生活，你们可能很难相信我……当我说一些关于白人的话时，我不是在谈论一个我不认识的人……”
Soon after that, Minister Lemuel Hassan urged me to address the brothers and sisters with anextemporaneous lecture. I was uncertain, and hesitant-but at least I had debated in prison, and Itried my best. (Of course, I can't remember exactly what I said, but I do know that in my beginningefforts my favorite subject was Christianity and the horrors of slavery, where I felt well-equippedfrom so much reading in prison. ) 
此后不久，莱缪尔·哈桑部长敦促我用即兴演讲来向兄弟姐妹发表讲话。我不确定，犹豫不决，但至少我在监狱里辩论过，我尽力了。（当然，我不记得我具体说了什么，但我知道我最初的努力中最喜欢的主题是基督教和奴隶制的恐怖，在那里我感到从在监狱里的大量阅读中装备良好。）
"My brothers and sisters, our white slavemaster's Christian religion has taught us black peoplehere in the wilderness of North America that we will sprout wings when we die and fly up into thesky where God will have for us a special place called heaven. This is white man's Christianreligion used to _brainwash_ us black people! We have _accepted_ it! We have _embraced_ it!We have _believed_ it! We have _practiced_ it! And while we are doing all of that, for himself, thisblue-eyed devil has _twisted_ his Christianity, to keep his _foot_ on our backs. . . to keep oureyes fixed on the pie in the sky andheaven in the hereafter. . . while _he_ enjoys _his_ heavenright _here_ . . . on _this earth_ . . . in _this life_." 
“我的兄弟姐妹们，我们的白人奴隶主的基督教信仰教导我们黑人在北美荒野中的人们，当我们死后会长出翅膀飞翔到天上，上帝会为我们提供一个特别的地方叫做天堂。这是白人的基督教信仰用来洗脑我们的黑人！我们已经接受了它！我们已经拥抱了它！我们已经相信了它！我们已经实践了它！而当我们在做所有这些的同时，为了自己，这个蓝眼睛的恶魔扭曲了他的基督教信仰，以保持他的脚在我们的背上。..保持我们的眼睛固定在天空中的馅饼和来世的天堂上。..同时他在这里享受他的天堂。..在这个地球上。..在这个生命中。”
Today when thousands of Muslims and others have been audiences out before me, whenaudiences of millions have been beyond radio and television microphones, I'm sure I rarely feelas much electricity as was then generated in me by the upturned faces of those seventy-five or ahundred Muslims, plus other curious visitors, sitting there in our storefront temple with thesquealing of pigs filtering in from the slaughterhouse just outside. 
今天，当成千上万的穆斯林和其他人在我之前成为了听众，当数百万人的听众超越了广播和电视麦克风，我相信我很少会感到像那时那样被那些坐在那儿的七十五或一百个穆斯林加上其他好奇的访客所激起的电流，他们坐在我们店面的神庙里，外面的屠宰场传来猪叫声。
In the summer of 1953-all praise is due to Allah-I was named Detroit Temple Number One'sAssistant Minister. 
1953年夏天——感谢安拉的恩赐——我被任命为底特律第一座寺庙的助理部长。
Every day after work, I walked, "fishing" for potential converts in the Detroit black ghetto. I sawthe African features of my black brothers and sisters whom the devilish white man hadbrainwashed. I saw the hair as mine had been for years, conked by cooking it with lye until it laylimp, looking straight like the white man's hair. Time and again Mr. Muhammad's teachings wererebuffed and even ridiculed . . . ."Aw, man, get out of my face, you niggers are crazy!" My headwould reel sometimes, with mingled anger and pity for my poor blind black brothers. I couldn'twait for the next time our Minister Lemuel Hassan would let me speak: 
每天下班后，我都会到底特律黑人贫民区的“钓鱼”，寻找潜在的皈依者。我看到了被邪恶的白人洗脑的黑人兄弟姐妹们的非洲特征。我看到了像我的头发一样多年来一直被用碱水浸泡直到变得柔软无力、像白人头发一样直的样子。一次又一次，穆罕穆德先生的教导遭到反驳甚至嘲笑……“啊，伙计，别在我面前晃悠，你们这些黑鬼太疯了！”有时我的头会因为对可怜的盲人黑人兄弟姐妹们的愤怒和怜悯而感到晕眩。我迫不及待地等待着下一次我们的部长莱缪尔·哈桑让我发言的机会。
"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, my brothers and sisters-Plymouth Rock landed on _us!_" . . ."Give _all_ you can to help Messenger Elijah Muhammad's independence program for the blackman! . . . This white man always has controlled us black people by keeping us running to himbegging, 'Please, lawdy, please, Mr. White Man, boss, would you push me off another crumbdown from your table that's sagging with riches . . . .' 
“我们没有降落在普利茅斯岩石上，我的兄弟姐妹们——普利茅斯岩石落在了我们身上！ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 给使者伊莱贾·穆罕穆德的黑人独立计划提供你所能给的一切帮助！这个白人总是通过让我们向他乞求，‘请，法官大人，请，白人先生，老板，你能把我从你那满是财富的摇摇欲坠的餐桌上推下去吗？’来控制我们黑人。”
". . . my _beautiful_, black brothers and sisters! And when we say 'black,' wemean everything notwhite, brothers and sisters! Because _look_ at your skins! We're all black to the white man, butwe're a thousand and one different colors. Turn around, _look_ at each other! What shade ofblack African polluted by devil white man are you? You see me-well, in the streets they used tocall me Detroit Red. Yes! Yes, that raping, red-headed devil was my _grandfather_! That close,yes! My _mother's_ father! She didn't like to speak of it, can you blame her? She said she neverlaid eyes on him! She was _glad_ for that! I'm _glad_ for her! If I could drain away _his_ bloodthat pollutes _my_ body, and pollutes my complexion, I'd do it! Because I hate every drop of therapist's blood that's in me! 
“……我美丽的黑人兄弟姐妹们！当我们说‘黑色’时，我们指的是所有不是白色的，兄弟姐妹们！因为看看你们的肤色！对于白人来说，我们都是黑色的，但我们每个人都有千变万化的颜色。转身，互相看看！你们是被这个邪恶的白人污染的黑非洲人，你们是什么颜色？你看我——是的，在街上他们曾经叫我底特律红。是的！是的，那个强奸犯，红头发的恶魔是我的祖父！就是他，没错！我母亲的父亲！她不喜欢谈论他，你能责怪她吗？她说她从没见过他！她很庆幸没有见到他！我也为她感到庆幸！如果我能排干那污染我的身体的、污染我的肤色的血，我会这么做！因为我讨厌治疗师身上的每一滴血！
"And it's not just me, it's _all_ of us! During slavery, _think_ of it, it was a _rare_ one of our blackgrandmothers, our great-grandmothers and our great-great-grandmothers who escaped the whiterapist slavemaster. That rapist slavemaster who emasculated the black man . . . with threats, withfear . . . until even today the black man lives with fear of the white man in his heart! Lives eventoday still under the heel of the white man! 
“而且不仅仅是我，而是我们所有人！在奴隶制时期，想一想，我们的黑人祖母、曾祖母和高曾祖母中只有极少数逃脱了白人治疗师奴隶主的魔掌。那个强奸犯奴隶主用威胁和恐惧使黑人男性阳痿……直到今天，这个黑人仍然心中害怕白人！他至今仍然生活在白人脚下！”
"_Think_ of it-think of that black slave man filled with fear and dread, hearing the screams of hiswife, his mother, his daughter being _taken_-in the barn, the kitchen, in the bushes! _Think_ of it,my dear brothers and sisters! _Think_ of hearing wives, mothers, daughters, being _raped_! Andyou were too filled with _fear_ of the rapist to do anything about it! And his vicious, animal attacks'offspring, this white man named things like 'mulatto' and 'quadroon' and 'octoroon' and all thoseother things that he has called us-you and me-when he is not calling us '_nigger_'! 
“想一想——想一想那个充满恐惧和恐惧的黑人奴隶，听到他妻子、母亲、女儿被带走时的尖叫声——在谷仓、厨房、灌木丛中！想一想，我亲爱的兄弟姐妹们！
"Turn around and look at each other, brothers and sisters, and _think_ of this! You and me,polluted all these colors-and this devil has the arrogance and the gall to think we, his victims,should _love_ him!" 
“转身看看彼此，兄弟姐妹们，想一想！你和我，被污染成了这么多颜色——这个恶魔竟然傲慢自大地认为我们这些他的受害者应该爱他！”
  I would become so choked up that sometimes I would walk in the streets until late into the night.Sometimes I would speak to no one for hours, thinking to myself about what the white man haddone to our poor people here in America. 
“我会变得哽咽，有时我会在街上走直到深夜。有时我会几个小时不和任何人说话，想着白人对我们美国这里的穷人做了些什么。”

At the Gar Wood factory where I worked, one day the supervisor came, looking nervous. He saidthat a man in the office was waiting to see me. 
在我工作的加伍德工厂，有一天主管来了，看起来很紧张。他说办公室里有个人等着见我。
The white man standing in there said, "I'm from the F.B.I." He flipped open-that way they do, toshock you-his little folded black leather case containing his identification. He told me to come withhim. He didn't say for what, or why. 
站在那里的白人说：“我是联邦调查局的。”他翻开他的小黑色皮箱——他们都是这样，为了吓唬你——里面装着他的证件。他让我跟着他走。他没有说是为了什么或者为什么。
I went with him. They wanted to know, at their office, why hadn't I registered for the Korean Wardraft? 
我跟他去了。他们在办公室里想知道，为什么我没有登记参加韩国兵役？
"I just got out of prison," I said. "I didn't know you took anybody with prison records." 
“我刚出狱，”我说。“我不知道你们要收有犯罪记录的人。”
They really believed I thought ex-convicts weren't supposed to register. They asked a lot ofquestions. I was glad they didn't ask if I intended to put on the white man's uniform, because Ididn't. They just took it for granted that I would. They told me they weren't going to send me to jailfor failing to register, that they were going to give me a break, but that I would have to registerimmediately. 
“他们真的相信，我认为前科犯不应该注册。他们问了我很多问题。我很高兴地看到他们没有问我是否打算穿上白人的制服，因为我没有。他们认为我会这样做。他们告诉我，如果我没有注册，他们不会送我去监狱，而是会给我一个机会，但那意味着我必须立即注册。”
So I went straight from there to the draft board. When they gave me a form to fill out, I wrote inthe appropriate places that I was a Muslim, and that I was a conscientious objector.I turned in the form. This middle-aged, bored-acting devil who scanned it looked out from underhis eyes at me. He got up and went into another office, obviously to consult someone over him.After a while, he came out and motioned for me to go in there. 
所以我直接从那里去了征兵委员会。当他们给我一张表格填写时，我在适当的地方填写了我是穆斯林和良心反对者。我交上了表格。这个中年的无聊的魔鬼扫描着它，从他的眼睛下面看着我。他起身走进另一个办公室，显然是在咨询某个人。过了一会儿，他出来示意让我进去。
These three-I believe there were three, as I remember-older devils sat behind desks. They allwore that "troublesome nigger" expression. And I looked "white devil" right back into their eyes.They asked me on what basis did I claim to be a Muslim in my religion. I told them that theMessenger of Allah was Mr. Elijah Muhammad, and that all who followed Mr. Muhammad here inAmerica were Muslims. I knew they had heard this before from some Temple One young brotherswho had been there before me. 
这三个——我记得有三个——年长的魔鬼坐在桌子后面。他们都戴着那种“麻烦的黑人”的表情。我也直视着“白人魔鬼”的眼睛。他们问我，我以什么为依据声称自己是穆斯林。我告诉他们，安拉的使者是伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生，所有在美国跟随穆罕默德先生的人都是穆斯林。我知道他们已经从我之前去过的某个一神论寺庙的年轻兄弟那里听过这些话了。
They asked if I knew what "conscientious objector" meant. I told them that when the white manasked me to go off somewhere and fight and maybe die to preserve the way the white mantreated the black man in America, then my conscience made me object. 
他们问我是否知道“良心反对者”的意思。我告诉他们，当白人命令我去某个地方战斗，甚至可能死亡以维护白人在美国对待黑人的方式时，我的良心使我反对。
They told me that my case would be "pending." But I was put through the physical anyway, andthey sent me a card with some kind of a classification. That was 1953, then I heard no more forseven years, when I received another classification card in the mail. In fact, I carry it in my walletright now. Here: it's card number 20 219 25 1377, it's dated November 21, 1960. It says, "Class 5- A," whatever that means, and stamped on the card's back is "Michigan Local Board No. 19,Wayne County, 3604 South Wayne Road, Wayne, Michigan." 
他们告诉我，我的案子将被“待定”。但我还是被安排了体格检查，他们还给我寄了一张卡片，上面有一些分类信息。那是1953年，然后我就再也没有听到任何消息，直到七年后我收到了另一份分类卡片。事实上，我现在还在钱包里带着它。这里是：它的卡号是20 219 25 1377，日期是1960年11月21日。上面写着“Class 5- A”，不管什么意思，卡片背面还盖着“Michigan Local Board No. 19, Wayne County, 3604 South Wayne Road, Wayne, Michigan”的印章。

Every time I spoke at our Temple One, my voice would still be hoarse from the last time. Mythroat took a long time to get into condition."Do you know _why_ the white man really hates you? It's because every time he sees your face,he sees a mirror of his crime-and his guilty conscience can't bear to face it! 
每次我在一神论寺庙讲道时，我的声音仍然会因为上一次而嘶哑。我的喉咙需要很长时间才能恢复状态。你知道为什么白人真的恨你吗？因为他每次看到你的脸都看到了他的罪行的镜像，而他内疚的良心无法面对它！
"Every white man in America, when he looks into a black man's eyes, should fall to his knees andsay 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry-my kind has committed history's greatest crime against your kind; will yougive me the chance to atone?' But do you brothers and sisters expect any white man to do that?_No_, you _know_ better! And why won't he do it? Because he _can't_ do it. The white man has_created_ a devil, to bring chaos upon this earth. . . ." 
“每个美国人，当他看着黑人的眼睛时，都应该跪下说‘对不起，对不起——我的种族犯下了历史上针对你们的种族的最严重罪行；你愿意给我一个赎罪的机会吗？’但是你们兄弟姐妹希望任何白人这样做吗？不，你们知道更好！为什么他不会这样做呢？因为他做不到。白人创造了一个魔鬼，给这个世界带来混乱…….”。
Somewhere about this time, I left the Gar Wood factory and I went to work for the Ford MotorCompany, one of the Lincoln-Mercury Division assembly lines. 
大约在此时，我离开了加伍德工厂，去为福特汽车公司工作，那是林肯-水星部门的一条装配线。
As a young minister, I would go to Chicago and see Mr. Elijah Muhammad every time I could getoff. He encouraged me to come when I could. I was treated as if I had been one of the sons of Mr.Muhammad and his dark, good wife Sister Clara Muhammad. I saw their children onlyoccasionally. Most of them in those years worked around Chicago in various jobs, laborers,driving taxis, and things such as that. Also living in the home was Mr. Muhammad's dear MotherMarie. 
作为一名年轻的牧师，我尽可能地去芝加哥看望伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生。他鼓励我随时都可以去。我被当作是穆罕默德先生和他的深色善良妻子克拉拉·穆罕默德的儿子之一。我只偶尔见到他们的孩子。这些年来，他们中的大多数人在芝加哥从事各种工作，如劳动者、出租车司机等。还有住在家里的是穆罕默德先生的亲爱的母亲玛丽。
I would spend almost as much time with Mother Marie as I did with Mr. Muhammad. I loved tohear her reminiscences about her son Elijah's early life when they lived in Sandersville, Georgia,where he was born in 1897. 
我会花几乎和穆罕默德先生一样多的时间与玛丽母亲在一起。我喜欢听她讲述关于儿子伊莱贾在佐治亚州桑德斯维尔的早期生活的回忆，他于1897年出生在那里。
Mr. Muhammad would talk with me for hours. After eating good, healthful Muslim food, we wouldstay at the dinner table and talk. Or I would ride with him as he drove on his daily rounds betweenthe few grocery stores that the Muslims then owned in Chicago. The stores were examples tohelp black people see what they could do for themselves by hiring their own kind and trading withtheir own kind and thus quit being exploited by the white man. 
穆罕默德先生会和我谈上几个小时。在享用健康美味的清真食品之后，我们会留在餐桌旁聊天。或者我会和他一起乘车，他每天在芝加哥仅有的几个穆斯林拥有的小杂货店之间穿梭。这些商店是为了让黑人看到他们可以通过雇用自己的同类并与他们的同类进行贸易来为自己做些什么，从而不再受到白人的剥削。
In the Muslim-owned combination grocery-drug store on Wentworth and 31st Street, Mr.Muhammad would sweep the floor or something like that. He would do such work himself as anexample to his followers whom he taught that idleness and laziness were among the black man'sgreatest sins against himself. I would want to snatch the broom from Mr. Muhammad's hand,because I thought he was too valuable to be sweeping a floor. But he wouldn't let me do anythingbut stay with him and listen while he advised me on the best ways to spread his message. 
在穆斯林拥有的韦特沃思和第31大街的杂货店兼药店里，穆罕默德先生会扫地或类似的事情。他会自己做这样的工作，作为他教导他的追随者的榜样，他告诉他们，懒惰和懒惰是黑人对自己最大的罪恶之一。我想从穆罕默德先生的手中夺走扫帚，因为我认为他太有价值了，不应该去扫地。但他不会让我做任何事情，只会让我留在那里听他的建议，关于如何最好地传播他的消息。
The way we were with each other, it would make me think of Socrates on the steps of the Athensmarket place, spreading his wisdom to his students. Or how one of those students, Aristotle, hadhis students following behind him, walking through the Lyceum.One day, I remember, a dirty glass of water was on a counter and Mr. Muhammad put a cleanglass of water beside it. "You want to know how to spread my teachings?" he said, and he pointedto the glasses of water. "Don't condemn if you see a person has a dirty glass of water," he said,"just show them the clean glass of water that you have. When they inspect it, you won't have tosay that yours is better." 
我们彼此相处的方式，让我想起了在雅典市场广场上，苏格拉底向他的学生传授智慧。或者像亚里士多德一样，他的学生跟在他身后，穿过吕克昂学院。我记得有一天，有一个脏水杯放在柜台上，穆罕默德先生在旁边放了一个干净的水杯。 “你想知道我如何传播我的教导吗？”他说，并指着两个杯子。 “如果你看到一个人有一杯脏水，不要谴责他们，”他说，“只要向他们展示你有一杯干净的水就可以了。当他们检查它时，你不必说你的水更好。”
Of all the things that Mr. Muhammad ever was to teach me, I don't know why, that still stands outin my mind. Although I haven't always practiced it. I love too much to battle. I'm inclined to tellsomebody if his glass of water is dirty. 
穆罕默德先生曾经教给我的所有事情中，我不知道为什么，那仍然在我的脑海中突出。虽然我并没有一直实践它。我太爱战斗了。我倾向于告诉某人他的水杯是脏的。
Mother Marie, when Mr. Muhammad was busy, would tell me about her son's boyhood and of hisgrowing up in Georgia to young manhood.Mother Marie's account of her son began when shewas herself but seven years old. She told me that then she had a vision that one day she wouldbe the mother of a very great man. She married a Baptist minister, Reverend Poole, who workedaround Sandersville on the farms, and in the sawmills. Among their thirteen children, said MotherMarie, little Elijah was very different, almost from when he could walk and talk. 
玛丽母亲，当穆罕默德先生忙的时候，会告诉我关于她儿子的童年和他在佐治亚州成长到年轻成年的故事。玛丽母亲的描述始于她自己只有七岁的时候。她告诉我那时她做了一个梦，梦见有一天她会成为一个伟大的人的母亲。她嫁给了一个浸礼会牧师，普尔牧师，他在桑德斯维尔周围的农场和锯木厂工作。玛丽母亲说，在他们十三个孩子中，小伊莱贾非常不同，几乎从他学会走路和说话的时候就开始了。
The small, frail boy usually settled his older brothers' and sisters' disputes, Mother Marie said.And young as he was, he became regarded by them as their leader. And Elijah, about the time heentered school, began displaying a strong race consciousness. After the fourth grade, becausethe family was so poor, Elijah had to quit school and begin full-time working. An older sister taughtElijah as much as she was able at night. 
玛丽母亲说，这个小而脆弱的男孩通常解决他的哥哥和姐姐之间的争端。尽管他很小，但他被他们视为领袖。伊莱贾在进入学校后不久开始表现出强烈的种族意识。在四年级之后，由于家庭非常贫困，伊莱贾不得不辍学并开始全职工作。他的一个姐姐尽可能地在晚上教伊莱贾。
Mother Marie said that Elijah spent hours poring through the Bible, with tears shining in his eyes.(Mr. Muhammad told me himself later that as a boy he felt that the Bible's words were a lockeddoor, that could be unlocked, if only he knew how, and he cried because of his frustrated anxietyto receive understanding. ) Elijah grew up into a still-frail teenager who displayed a mostuncommonly strong love for his race, and, Mother Marie said, instead of condemning Negroes'faults, young Elijah always would speak of reasons for those faults. 
玛丽母亲说，伊莱贾花了数小时仔细阅读圣经，眼中含着泪水。(穆罕默德先生后来告诉我他自己，作为一个男孩，他觉得圣经的话语是一扇锁着的门，如果他知道如何打开它，那扇门就可以被打开了，他因无法获得理解而感到沮丧和焦虑，并因此而哭泣。)伊莱贾成长为一个仍然虚弱的少年，表现出对种族的非常强烈的爱，玛丽母亲说，小伊莱贾从不谴责黑人的错误，而是总是谈论那些错误的原因。
Mother Marie has since died. I believe that she had as large a funeral as Chicago has seen. Notonly Muslims, but others knew of the deep bond that Messenger Elijah had with his mother. 
玛丽母亲去世后，我相信她有一场芝加哥历史上最盛大的葬礼。不仅穆斯林，其他人都知道使者伊莱贾和他母亲之间深厚的联系。
"I am not ashamed to say how little learning I have had," Mr. Muhammad told me. "My going toschool no further than the fourth grade proves that I can know nothing except the truth I havebeen taught by Allah. Allah taught memathematics. He found me with a sluggish tongue, andtaught me how to pronounce words." 
“我不觉得羞愧于承认自己学得很少，”穆罕默德先生告诉我。“我只上了四年级就辍学证明了我除了被真主所教的真理之外一无所知。真主教我数学，他发现我口齿不清，并教我如何发音。”
Mr. Muhammad said that somehow, he never could stand how the Sandersville white farmers, thesawmill foremen, or other white employers would habitually and often curse Negro workers. Hesaid he would politely ask any for whom he worked never to curse him. "I would ask them to justfire me if they didn't like my work, but just don't curse me." (Mr. Muhammad's ordinaryconversation was the manner he used when making speeches. He was not "eloquent," aseloquence is usually meant, but whatever he uttered had an impact on me that trained orators didnot begin to have. ) He said that on the jobs he got, he worked so honestly that generally he wasput in charge of the other Negroes. 
穆罕默德先生说，他从来不能忍受桑德斯维尔的白人农民、锯木厂工头或其他白人雇主习惯性地经常咒骂黑人工人。他说他会礼貌地要求任何为他工作的人不要咒骂他。 “如果他们不喜欢我的工作，我会要求他们解雇我，但不要咒骂我。” （穆罕默德先生平常的对话是他演讲时使用的方式。他不是通常意义上的“雄辩”，但他所说的话对我有影响，受过训练的演说家们则无法达到这种影响。）他说，他在得到工作时总是非常诚实地工作，因此通常情况下他被派去指挥其他黑人。
After Mr. Muhammad and Sister Clara met and married and their first two children had been born,a white employer early in 1923 did curse Mr. Muhammad, then Elijah Poole. Elijah Poole,determined to avoid trouble, took his family to Detroit, arriving when he was twenty-five. Fivemore children would be born there in Detroit, and, finally, the last one in Chicago. 
穆罕默德先生和克拉拉修女相遇、结婚，他们的前两个孩子出生后，一个白人雇主在1923年初诅咒了穆罕默德先生，然后是伊莱贾·普尔。伊莱贾·普尔决心避免麻烦，带着家人去了底特律，在那里他二十五岁时到达。在底特律又生了五个孩子，最后在芝加哥生了最后一个孩子。
In Detroit in 1931, Mr. Muhammad met Master W. D. Fard. 
1931年，在底特律，穆罕默德先生遇到了大师W . D.法尔德。
The effects of the depression were bad everywhere, but in the black ghetto they were horrible,Mr. Muhammad told me. A small, light brown-skinned man knocked from door to door at theapartments of the poverty-stricken Negroes. The man offered for sale silks and other yard goods,and he identified himself as "a brother from the East."This man began to tell Negroes how they came from a distant land, in the seeds of theirforefathers.He warned them against eating the "filthy pig" and other "wrong foods" that it was habitual forNegroes to eat. 
穆罕默德先生告诉我，这种沮丧情绪的影响在任何地方都是不好的，但在黑人贫民窟里，它是可怕的。一个肤色较浅的瘦弱男子挨家挨户地敲门，推销丝绸和其他庭院用品，并自称是“来自东方的兄弟”。这个人开始告诉黑人他们来自遥远的土地，他们的祖先的种子。他警告他们不要食用“肮脏的猪肉”和其他“错误的食物”，这是黑人习惯性的饮食。
Among the Negroes whom he found most receptive, he began holding little meetings in their poorhomes. The man taught both the Quran and the Bible, and his students included Elijah Poole. 
在他发现最能接受的人中，他开始在他们的贫民窟里举行小型会议。这个人教授古兰经和圣经，他的学生包括伊莱贾·普尔。
This man said his name was W. D. Fard. He said that he was born in the _Koreish_ tribe ofMuhammad ibn Abdullah, the Arabian prophet Himself. This peddler of silks and yard goods, Mr.W. D. Fard, knew the Bible better than any of the Christian-bred Negroes. 
这个人说他的名字是W . D.法尔德。他说他出生在Muhammad ibn Abdullah，阿拉伯先知本人的Koreish部落。这个贩卖丝绸和庭院用品的小贩W . D.法尔德比任何基督教背景的黑人都更懂圣经。
In the essence, Mr. W. D. Fard taught that God's true name was Allah, that His true religion wasIslam, that the true name for that religion's people was Muslims. 
本质上，W . D.法尔德教导说，真主的真名是阿拉，他的真正宗教是伊斯兰教，那个宗教的人的真正名字是穆斯林。
Mr. W. D. Fard taught that the Negroes in America were directly descended from Muslims. Hetaught that Negroes in America were Lost Sheep, lost for four hundred years from the Nation ofIslam, and that he, Mr. Fard, had come to redeem and return the Negro to his true religion. 
W . D.法尔德教导说，美国黑人是直接从穆斯林后裔中传承下来的。他教导说，美国黑人是迷失的羊群，在伊斯兰教国家失落了四百年，而他本人法尔德先生则前来赎回和使黑人回到他的真正宗教中去。
No heaven was in the sky, Mr. Fard taught, and no hell was in the ground. Instead, both heavenand hell were conditions in which people lived right here on this planet Earth. Mr. Fard taught thatthe Negro in America had been for four hundred years in hell, and he, Mr. Fard, had come toreturn them to where heaven for them was-back home, among their own kind. 
法尔德先生教导说，天空中没有天堂，地上也没有地狱。相反，天堂和地狱都是人们生活在这个地球上的条件。法尔德先生教导说，美国黑人已经在这里的地狱中度过了四百年，而他本人法尔德先生则前来将他们带回他们的天堂——回到他们的家中，与自己种族在一起。
Master Fard taught that as hell was on earth, also on earth was the devil-the white race whichwas bred from black Original Man six thousand years before, purposely to create a hell on earthfor the next six thousand years.The black people, God's children, were Gods themselves, Master Fard taught. And he taught thatamong them was one, also a human being like the others, who was the God of Gods: The Most,Most High, The Supreme Being, supreme in wisdom and power-and His proper name was Allah. 
法尔德大师教导说，既然地狱在地球上，那么魔鬼也在地球上。这个白种人是由六千年前的黑种人繁殖而来的，他们蓄意地在地球上创造一个地狱，持续六千年。法尔德大师教导说，黑人是上帝的孩子，他们自己就是神。他教导说，在他们中间有一个人也像其他人一样是人类，他是众神之神：至高无上、至高无上者、最高存在、智慧和力量至高无上的真主——他的真名是阿拉。
Among his handful of first converts in 1931 in Detroit, Master W. D. Fard taught that every religionsays that near the Last Day, or near the End of Time, God would come, to resurrect the LostSheep, to separate them from their enemies, and restore them to their own people. Master Fardtaught that Prophecy referred to this Finder and Savior of the Lost Sheep as The Son of Man, orGod in Person, or The Lifegiver, The Redeemer, or The Messiah, who would come as lightningfrom the East and appear in the West. 
在1931年他在底特律的少数第一批皈依者中， W . D.法尔德大师教导说，每个宗教都说，在最后的几天或时间的尽头，上帝会来拯救迷失的羊群，将他们从敌人中解救出来，并将他们带回自己的人民。法尔德大师教导说，这个预言所说的寻找和拯救迷失的羊群的人被称为人类之子、神的化身、生命之源、救世主、弥赛亚，他会像闪电一样从东方出现并出现在西方。
He was the One to whom the Jews referred as The Messiah, the Christians as The Christ, andthe Muslims as The Mahdi. 
他是犹太人称为弥赛亚、基督徒称为基督、穆斯林称为马赫迪的人。
*     *     * 
I would sit, galvanized, hearing what I then accepted from Mr. Muhammad's own mouth as beingthe true history of our religion, the true religion for the black man. Mr. Muhammad told me thatone evening he had a revelation that Master W. D. Fard represented the fulfillment of theprophecy. 
我坐在那里，受到激励，听到我从穆罕默德先生自己的口中所接受的关于我们宗教的真正历史、黑人的真正宗教的内容。穆罕默德先生告诉我，有一天晚上他得到了启示，认为W . D.法尔德大师代表了预言的实现。
"I asked Him," said Mr. Muhammad, "'Who are you, and what is your real name?' And He said, 'Iam The One the world has been looking for to come for the past two thousand years.' 
“我问祂，”穆罕默德先生说，“你是谁，你的真实名字是什么？”他回答说：“我是过去两千年来世界一直在寻找的人。”
"I said to Him again," said Mr. Muhammad, "'What is your _true_ name?' And then He said, 'Myname is Mahdi. I came to guide you into the right path.'" 
“我又问他，”穆罕默德先生说，“你的真实名字是什么？”然后他说：“我的名字是马赫迪。我来指引你们走向正确的道路。”
 Mr. Elijah Muhammad says that he sat listening with an open heart and an open mind-the way Iwas sitting listening to Mr. Muhammad. And Mr. Muhammad said he never doubted any word thatthe "Savior" taught him. 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生说，他坐下来倾听时，心和思想都是开放的——就像我坐在那里聆听穆罕默德先生一样。而且穆罕默德先生说，他从没有怀疑“救世主”教他的任何一个词。
Starting to organize, Master W. D. Fard set up a class for training ministers to carry the teachingsto America's black people. In giving names to these first ministers, Master Fard named ElijahPoole "Elijah Karriem." 
开始组织起来， W . D.法尔德大师成立了一个培训部长的班级，将教义传达给美国的黑人。在给这些第一位部长命名时，法尔德大师将伊莱贾·普尔命名为“ Elijah Karriem ”。
Next, Master W. D. Fard established in 1931 in Detroit a University of Islam. It had adult classeswhich taught, among other things, mathematics, to help the poor Negroes quit being duped anddeceived by the "tricknology" of "the blue-eyed devil white man." 
接下来， W . D.法尔德大师于1931年在底特律创立了伊斯兰教大学。它有成人课程，教授数学等科目，帮助贫困的黑人不再受到“蓝眼白种人”这个“魔鬼白人”的诡计和欺骗。
Starting a school in the rough meant that it lacked qualified teachers, but a start had to be madesomewhere. Mr. Elijah Karriem removed his own children from Detroit public schools, to start anucleus of children in the University of Islam. 
开始在贫民窟办学校意味着缺乏合格的教师，但必须在某个地方开始。伊莱贾·卡里姆先生将自己的孩子从底特律公立学校中移除，以便在伊斯兰教大学开办儿童班。
Mr. Muhammad told me that his older children's lack of formal education reflected their sacrificeto form the backbone for today's Universities of Islam in Detroit and Chicago which have better- qualified faculties. 
穆罕默德先生告诉我，他的大孩子由于缺乏正式的教育而牺牲了自己的前程，为今天在底特律和芝加哥的伊斯兰教大学奠定了骨干基础，这些大学的师资力量更为雄厚。
Master W. D. Fard selected Elijah Karriem to be the Supreme Minister, over all other ministers,and among all of those others sprang up a bitter jealousy. All of them had better education thanElijah Karriem, and also they were more articulate than he was. They raged, even in hispresence, "Why should we bow down to someone who appears less qualified?" 
W . D.法尔德大师选择伊莱贾·卡里姆担任最高部长，比其他所有部长都要高，其他所有人中都涌现出了强烈的嫉妒。他们所有人都比伊莱贾·卡里姆受过更好的教育，而且他们也比他更善于表达。他们在他在场的时候大发雷霆，“为什么要向看起来没有资格的人鞠躬？”
But Mr. Elijah Karriem was then in some way re-named "Elijah Muhammad," who as the SupremeMinister began to receive from Master W. D. Fard for the next three and a half years privateteachings, during which time he says he "heard things never revealed to others."During this period, Mr. Elijah Muhammad and Master W. D. Fard went to Chicago and establishedTemple Number Two. They also established in Milwaukee the beginnings of a Temple NumberThree. 
但是伊莱贾·卡里姆先生在某种程度上被重新命名为“ Elijah Muhammad ”，他作为最高部长开始从 W . D.法尔德大师那里接受私人教导，在接下来的三年半时间里，他说自己“听到了从未向其他人透露过的事情”。在此期间， Elijah Muhammad先生和 W . D.法尔德大师前往芝加哥建立了第二座寺庙。他们还建立了密尔沃基市第三座寺庙的雏形。
In 1934, Master W. D. Fard disappeared, without a trace. 
1934年， W . D.法尔德大师神秘失踪，没有任何线索。
Elijah Muhammad says that attempts were made upon his life, because the other ministers'jealo usy had reached such a pitch. He says that these "hypocrites" forced him to flee to Chicago.Temple Number Two became his headquarters until the "hypocrites" pursued him there, forcinghim to flee again. In Washington, D. C., he began Temple Number Four. Also while there, in theCongressional Library, he studied books which he says Master W. D. Fard had told him containeddifferent pieces of the truth that devil white man had recorded, but which were not in booksgenerally available to the public. 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德说，有人企图杀害他，因为其他部长的嫉妒已经达到了这样的程度。他说这些“伪君子”迫使他逃往芝加哥。第二座寺庙成为他的总部，直到这些“伪君子”追到那里，迫使他再次逃亡。在华盛顿特区，他开始建立第四座寺庙。在那里，他还在国会图书馆研究了Master W. D. Fard告诉他包含魔鬼白人记录的不同真相的书籍，但这些书籍并不通常向公众提供。
Saying that he was still pursued by the "hypocrites," Mr. Muhammad fled from city to city, neverstaying long in any. Whenever able, now and then, he slipped home to see his wife and his eightyoung children, who were fed by other poor Muslims who shared what little they had. Even Mr.Muhammad's original Chicago followers wouldn't know he was at home, for he says the"hypocrites" made serious efforts to kill him. 
穆罕默德先生说，他仍然被“伪君子”追杀，从一座城市逃到另一座城市，从不在任何一个城市停留太久。只要有机会，他就会偷偷回家看望他的妻子和八个年幼的孩子，这些孩子由其他贫穷的穆斯林喂养，他们分享着自己仅有的一点东西。甚至穆罕默德先生最初的芝加哥追随者也不会知道他在家里，因为他说“伪君子”们曾做出过杀害他的努力。
In 1942, Mr. Muhammad was arrested. He says Uncle Tom Negroes had tipped off the devil whiteman to his teachings, and he was charged by this devil white man with draft-dodging, although hewas too old for military service. He was sentenced to five years in prison. In the Milan, Michigan,federal prison, Mr. Muhammad served three and a half years, then he was paroled. He hadreturned to his work in 1946, to remove the blinders from the eyes of the black man in thewilderness of North America. 
1942年，穆罕默德先生被捕。他说汤姆叔叔的黑人们向魔鬼白人告密了他的教导，他被这个魔鬼白人指控逃避征兵，尽管他已经太老了，无法服兵役。他被判处五年徒刑。在密歇根州米兰的联邦监狱里，穆罕默德先生服刑三年半，然后被假释。他于1946年重返工作，为北美荒野中的黑人摘下眼罩。
  I can hear myself now, at the lectern in our little Muslim Temple, passionately addressing myblack brothers and sisters: 
我现在可以听到自己在小穆斯林寺庙的讲台上，热情地向我的黑人兄弟姐妹们发表演讲：
"This little, gentle, sweet man! The Honorable Elijah Muhammad who is at this very hour teachingour brothers and sisters over there in Chicago! Allah's Messenger-which makes him the mostpowerful black man in America! For you and me, he has sacrificed seven years on the run fromfilthy hypocrites, he spent another three and a half years in a prison cage! He was put there bythe devil white man! That devil white man does not want the Honorable Elijah Muhammad stirringawake the sleeping giant of you and me, and all of our ignorant, brainwashed kind here in thewhite man's heaven and the black man's hell herein the wilderness of North America! 
“这个小小的、温和的、甜美的人！尊贵的伊莱贾·穆罕默德正在此刻教导我们在芝加哥的兄弟姐妹们！真主的使者使他成为美国最有力量的黑人！为了你和我，他牺牲了七年的时间在肮脏的伪君子中逃亡，他还花了另外三年半时间被关在监狱里！他被那个恶魔白人送进去的！那个恶魔白人不想让尊贵的伊莱贾·穆罕默德唤醒你我沉睡中的巨人，以及我们所有在这个白人天堂中无知、被洗脑的人，以及在这个北美荒野中黑人地狱中的人们！
"I have sat at our Messenger's feet, hearing the truth from his own mouth! I have pledged on myknees' to Allah to tell the white man about his crimes and the black man the true teachings of ourHonorable Elijah Muhammad. I don't care if it costs my life . . . ." 
“我曾经坐在我们使者的脚下，从他自己的口中听到真相！我曾在膝盖上向真主发誓要告诉白人他的罪行，并告诉黑人我们尊贵的伊莱贾·穆罕默德的真实教导。我不在乎这是否要付出我的生命. . . .”
This was my attitude. These were my uncompromising words, uttered anywhere, withouthesitation or fear. I was his most faithful servant, and I know today that I did believe in him morefirmly than he believed in himself. 
这就是我的态度。这些都是我毫不妥协的话语，无论在哪里说出来都不会犹豫或害怕。我是他最忠实的仆人，我知道今天我确实比他更坚信他。
In the years to come, I was going to have to face a psychological and spiritual crisis. 
在未来的岁月里，我将面临一场心理和精神上的危机。
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
第十三章
MINISTER MALCOLM X 
马尔科姆·X部长
I quit the Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury Division. It had becomeclear to me that Mr.Muhammad needed ministers to spread his teachings, to establish more temples among thetwenty-two million black brothers who were brainwashed and sleeping in the cities of NorthAmerica. 
我辞去了福特汽车公司的林肯-水星分公司。我意识到穆罕默德需要部长们传播他的教义，在北美城市中被洗脑和沉睡的两千万黑人兄弟中建立更多的寺庙。
My decision came relatively quickly. I have always been an activist, and my personal chemistryperhaps made me reach more quickly than most ministers in the Nation of Islam that stage ofdedication. But every minister in the Nation, in his own time, in his own way, in the privacy of hisown soul, came to the conviction that it was written that all of his "before" life had been onlyconditioning and preparation to become a disciple of Mr. Muhammad's. 
我的决定来得相对很快。我一直是一个积极分子，也许我的个人性格使我比大多数伊斯兰国家部长更快地达到了这个奉献阶段。但是，每个国家部长都在他的时间里，以他自己的方式，在他自己的内心深处，都得出结论，那就是他的“之前”的生活只是成为穆罕默德的信徒的准备和条件。
Everything that happens-Islam teaches-is written. 
伊斯兰教教导，一切发生的事情都是注定的。
Mr. Muhammad invited me to visit his home in Chicago, as often as possible, while he trained me,for months. 
穆罕默德先生邀请我尽可能经常地在他训练我的那几个月里去拜访他在芝加哥的家。
Never in prison had I studied and absorbed so intensely as I did now under Mr. Muhammad'sguidance. I was immersed in the worship rituals; in what he taught us were the true natures ofmen and women; the organizational and administrative procedures; the real meanings, and theinterrelated meanings, and uses, of the Bible and the Quran. 
我在监狱里从未像现在这样，在穆罕默德先生的指导下如此专注地学习和吸收。我沉浸在崇拜仪式中，他教我们关于男人和女人的真实本质；组织和行政程序；圣经和古兰经的真正含义以及相互关联的含义和用法。
I went to bed every night ever more awed. If not Allah, who else could have put such wisdom intothat little humble lamb of a man from the Georgia fourth grade and sawmills and cotton patches.The "lamb of a man" analogy I drew for myself from the prophecy in the Book of Revelations of asymbolic lamb with a two-edged sword in its mouth. Mr. Muhammad's two-edged sword was histeachings, which cut back and forth to free the black man's mind from the white man. 
每晚上床睡觉时，我都更加敬畏。如果不是安拉，还有谁能把这个智慧注入一个来自乔治亚州小学、锯木厂和棉花田的卑微小人中呢？我从启示录中的预言中为自己画了一个“小羊人”的比喻，象征着一只口中咬着两刃剑的小羊。穆罕默德先生的两刃剑就是他的教导，它来回切割，使黑人的思想摆脱了白人的影响。
My adoration of Mr. Muhammad grew, in the sense of the Latin root word_adorare_. It meansmuch more than our "adoration" or "adore." It means that my worship of him was so awesomethat he was the first man whom I had ever feared-not fear such as of a man with a gun, but thefear such as one has of the power of the sun. 
我对穆罕默德先生的敬仰在拉丁语词根“adore”的意义上增长。它意味着比我们的“敬仰”或“崇拜”更多。它意味着我对他的崇拜是如此令人敬畏，以至于他是我从未害怕过的第一个男人 - 不是害怕一个拿着枪的男人，而是害怕太阳的力量。
Mr. Muhammad, when he felt me able, permitted me to go to Boston. Brother Lloyd X lived there.He invited people whom he had gotten interested in Islam to hear me in his living room. 
穆罕默德先生，当他觉得我能够时，允许我前往波士顿。洛伊德兄弟住在那里。他邀请了他对伊斯兰教感兴趣的人在他的客厅里听我演讲。
I quote what I said when I was just starting out, and then later on in other places, as I can bestremember the general pattern that I used, in successive phases, in those days. I know that then Ialways liked to start off with my favorite analogy of Mr. Muhammad. 
我引用了我刚开始时的发言，然后后来在其他地方，因为我可以最好地记住那些日子里我在连续阶段使用的总体模式。我知道那时我总是喜欢以我最喜欢的比喻开始我的发言：穆罕默德先生。
"God has given Mr. Muhammad some sharp truth," I told them. "It is like a two-edged sword. Itcuts into you. It causes you great pain, but if you can take the truth, it will cure you and save youfrom what otherwise would be certain death." 
“真主赋予了穆罕默德先生一些尖锐的真相，”我告诉他们。 “它像一把双刃剑。它刺入你的身体。它给你造成巨大的痛苦，但如果你能接受真相，它将治愈你并拯救你免于必然的死亡。”
Then I wouldn't waste any time to start opening their eyes about the devil white man. "I know youdon't realize the enormity, the horrors, of the so-called _Christian_ white man's crime. . . . 
然后我就不会浪费时间去开启他们对白人魔鬼的眼界。“我知道你没有意识到所谓的基督教白人所犯罪行的可怕和罪恶程度。 .. ...
"Not even in the _Bible_ is there such a crime! God in His wrath struck down with _fire_ theperpetrators of _lesser_ crimes! _One hundred million_ of us black people! Your grandparents!Mine! _Murdered_ by this white man. To get fifteen million of us here to make us his slaves, onthe way he murdered one hundred million! I wish it was possible for me to show you the seabottom in those days-the black bodies, the blood, the bones broken by boots and clubs! Thepregnant black women who were thrown overboard if they got toosick! Thrown overboard to thesharks that had learned that following these slave ships was the way to grow fat! 
“即使在圣经中也没有这样一项罪行！上帝在愤怒之下用火摧毁了较小罪行的犯罪者！我们这一亿黑人！你的祖父母！我的父母！被这个白人所谋杀。为了控制我们这十五亿人，他在路上谋杀了一亿人口！我希望有一天我能向你展示那个时代的真相——那些黑人的尸体、鲜血、被踢和棍棒打断的骨头！那些怀孕的黑人妇女如果感到不适就被扔下船去！被扔给那些学会跟随这些奴隶船就可以发胖的鲨鱼！
"Why, the white man's raping of the black race's woman began right on those slave ships! Theblue-eyed devil could not even wait until he got them here! Why, brothers and sisters, civilizedmankind has never known such an orgy of greed and lust and murder. . . ." 
“为什么，白人对黑人种族的女性的强奸是从那些奴隶船上开始的！蓝眼睛的魔鬼甚至等不到他们到这里来！为什么，兄弟姐妹们，文明人类从未经历过这样的贪婪、欲望和谋杀狂欢。 .. ...”
The dramatization of slavery never failed intensely to arouse Negroes hearing its horrors spelledout for the first time. It's unbelievable how many black men and women have let the white manfool them into holding an almost romantic idea of what slave days were like. And once I had themfired up with slavery, I would shift the scene to themselves. 
奴隶制的戏剧化总是能够强烈地引起第一次听到其恐怖经历的黑人的共鸣。令人难以置信的是，有多少黑人男性和女性被白人愚弄，让他们对奴隶时代有着一种几乎浪漫化的想法。一旦我点燃了他们对奴隶制的热情，我就会把场景转移到他们自己身上。
"I want you, when you leave this room, to start to _see_ all this whenever you see this devil whiteman. Oh, yes, he's a devil! I just want you to start watching him, in his places where he doesn'twant you around; watch him reveling in his precious-ness, and his exclusiveness, and his vanity,while he continues to subjugate you and me . 
“我希望你在离开这个房间时，每当你看到这个白人魔鬼时就开始看到这一切。是的，他是个魔鬼！我只想让你开始观察他，在他不想让你出现的地方；观察他沉迷于他的珍贵、排他和虚荣心，同时他继续奴役你和我。”
"Every time you see a white man, think about the devil you're seeing! Think of how it was on_your_ slave foreparents' bloody, sweaty backs that he _built_ this empire that's today the richestof all nations-where his evil and his greed cause him to be hated around the world!" 
“每次你看到白人，都要想到你所见到的魔鬼！想想你的奴隶祖先是如何在他的血汗背上建造了这个如今成为最富有的国家 - 他的邪恶和贪婪使得他在整个世界上都受到仇恨！”
Every meeting, the people who had been there before returned, bringing friends. None of themever had heard the wraps taken off the white man. I can't remember any black man ever in thoseliving-room audiences in Brother Lloyd X's home at 5 Wellington Street who didn't stand upimmediately when I asked after each lecture, "Will all stand who believe what you have heard?"And each Sunday night, some of them stood, while I could see others not quiteready, when Iasked, "How many of you want to _follow_ The Honorable Elijah Muhammad?" 
每一次聚会，之前来过的人都会带着朋友再次参加。他们中没有人听过白人的真实面目。我无法回忆起在洛伊德兄弟位于Wellington街5号的家中的那些客厅观众中，有哪个黑人没有在我每次演讲结束后立即站起来，当我问道：“谁信仰你们所听到的，请站起来？”每个周日晚上，有些人会站起来，而当我问到“你们有多少人想追随尊敬的伊莱贾·穆罕默德？”时，我能看到其他人还没有准备好。
Enough had stood up after about three months that we were able to open a little temple. Iremember with what pleasure we rented some folding chairs. I was beside myself with joy when Icould report to Mr. Muhammad a new temple address. 
在大约三个月后，已经有足够的人站起来了，我们能够开设一个小小的寺庙。我记得我们很高兴地租了一些折叠椅子。当我能够向穆罕默德先生报告一个新的寺庙地址时，我欣喜若狂。
It was when we got this little mosque that my sister Ella first began to come to hear me. She sat,staring, as though she couldn't believe it was me. Ella never moved, even when I had only askedall who believed what they had heard to stand up. She contributed when our collection was held.It didn't bother or challenge me at all about Ella. I never even thought about converting her, astoughminded and cautious about joining anything as I personally knew her to be. I wouldn't haveexpected anyone short of Allah Himself to have been able to convert Ella. 
当我们得到这个小清真寺时，我的妹妹艾拉第一次开始来听我的演讲。她坐在那里，凝视着，好像不敢相信那是我。艾拉从不动，即使我只是要求所有相信他们所听到的人站起来。当我们举行捐赠仪式时，她也捐了钱。对于艾拉，这并不让我烦恼或挑战。我从没想过要改变她，因为她是一个坚定而谨慎的人，我知道她不会轻易加入任何事情。我甚至不会想到除了真主阿拉之外，还有谁能改变艾拉的想法。
I would close the meeting as Mr. Muhammad had taught me: "In the name of Allah, thebeneficent, the merciful, all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, the beneficent,merciful master of the day of judgment in which we now live -Thee alone do we serve, and Theealone do we beseech for Thine aid. Guide us on the right path, the path of those upon whomThou has bestowed favors -not of those upon whom Thy wrath is brought down, nor the path ofthose who go astray after they have heard Thy teaching. I bear witness that there is no God butThee and The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is Thy Servant and Apostle. "I believed he had beendivinely sent to our people by Allah Himself. 
我会像穆罕默德先生教我的那样结束会议：“以真主阿拉——至仁至慈的主宰之名，所有的赞美都应归于真主阿拉，万界的主，我们现居日审判之主的仁爱和慈悲的主人。我们只服务于你，我们只恳求你的帮助。引导我们走上正确的道路，那些你赐予恩惠的人的道路——而不是那些你带来愤怒的人的道路，也不是那些在听到你的教导后迷路的人的道路。我作证，除你之外没有上帝，伊莱贾·穆罕默德阁下是真主的使者和使徒。”我相信他是被真主阿拉亲自派遣给我们的人民。
I would raise my hand, for them to be dismissed: "Do nothing unto anyone that you would not liketo have done unto yourself. Seek peace, and never be the aggressor-but if anyone attacks you,we do not teach you to turn the othercheek. May Allah bless you to be successful and victoriousin all that you do." 
我会举起我的手，让他们离开：“不要对任何人做你不愿意对自己做的事情。寻求和平，永远不要成为攻击者——但如果任何人攻击你，我们不会教你转身面对另一面。愿真主保佑你在所做的一切中取得成功和胜利。”
Except for that one day when I had stayed with Ella on the way to Detroit after prison, I had notbeen in the old Roxbury streets for seven years. I went to have a reunion with Shorty. 
除了那个在出狱后我和艾拉一起前往底特律的那天，我已经七年没有回到过老洛辛布鲁克街了。我去找矮子重温旧梦。
Shorty, when I found him, acted uncertain. The wire had told him I was in town, and on some"religious kick." He didn't know if I was serious, or if I was another of the hustling preacher-pimpsto be found in every black ghetto, the ones with some little storefront churches of mostlyhardworking, older women, who kept their "pretty boy" young preacher dressed in "sharp" clothesand driving a fancy car. I quickly let Shorty know how serious I was with Islam, but then, talkingthe old street talk, I quickly put him at his ease, and we had a great reunion. We laughed until wecried at Shorty's dramatization of his reactions when he heard that judge keep saying "Count one,ten years . . . count two, ten years -" We talked about how having those white girls with us hadgotten as tea years where we had seen in prison plenty of worse offenders with far less time toserve. 
当我找到矮子时，他表现得很不确定。他不知道我是不是认真的，也不知道我是不是在每个黑人聚居区都能找到的另一个忙碌的传教士——皮条客，每个黑人聚居区都有一些临街的小教堂，里面大多是勤劳的老妇人，她们让“漂亮男孩”年轻的传教士穿着“时髦”的衣服，开着一辆豪华轿车。我很快就让矮子知道我对伊斯兰教的态度是多么认真，但后来，说起老掉牙的街谈巷议，我很快就让他放松下来，我们有了一个很好的团聚。我们笑了，直到肖蒂听到法官不停地说“第一，十年”时，他的反应被戏剧化了。第二，十年——我们谈到那些白人女孩是如何和我们一起度过的，我们在监狱里看到了很多更坏的罪犯，他们服刑的时间少得多。
Shorty still had a little band, and he was doing fairly well. He was rightfully very proud that inprison he had studied music. I told him enough about Islam to see from his reactions that hedidn't really want to hear it. In prison, he had misheard about our religion. He got me off thesubject by making a joke. He said that he hadn't had enough pork chops and white women. Idon't know if he has yet, or not. I know that he's married to a white woman now. . . and he's fat asa hog from eating hog. 
Shorty仍然有一个小乐队，而且他混得不错。他很自豪地告诉我，在监狱里他学习了音乐。我告诉了他足够多的关于伊斯兰教的事情，从他的反应中可以看出他并不真正想听。在监狱里，他误解了我们的宗教。他用一个笑话岔开了话题。他说他还没有吃够猪排和白女人。我不知道他现在是否已经满足了这个愿望。我知道他现在和一个白人女性结婚了。……而且因为他吃的都是猪肉，他现在胖得像头猪一样。
I also saw John Hughes, the gambling-house owner, and some others I had known who were stillaround Roxbury. The wire about me had made them all uncomfortable, but my "What you know,Daddy?" approach at least enabled us to have some conversations. I never mentioned Islam tomost of them. I knew,from what I had been when I was with them, how brainwashed they were. 
我还见到了赌博场所老板约翰·休斯以及其他一些我认识的还在罗克斯伯里周围转悠的人。有关我的谣言让他们都感到不安，但是我用“你知道什么，爸爸？”的方式至少让我们能够进行一些对话。我从未向大多数人提到伊斯兰教。我知道，从我曾经和他们在一起的时候起，他们被洗脑的程度有多深。
As Temple Eleven's minister, I served only briefly, because as soon as I got it organized, byMarch 1954, I left it in charge of Minister Ulysses X, and the Messenger moved me on toPhiladelphia. 
作为第十一圣殿的部长，我只短暂地担任过，因为一旦我把它组织起来，到了1954年3月，我就把它交给了尤利塞斯· X部长掌管，而使者又将我调往费城。
The City of Brotherly Love black people reacted even faster to the truth about the white man thanthe Bostonians had. And Philadelphia's Temple Twelve was established by the end of May. It hadtaken a little under three months. 
“兄弟之爱之城”的黑人对白人的真相的反应比波士顿人更快。费城的第12座圣殿在5月底建立起来，用了不到三个月的时间。
The next month, because of those Boston and Philadelphia successes, Mr. Muhammadappointed me to be the minister of Temple Seven-in vital New York City. 
下个月，由于波士顿和费城的成功，穆罕默德先生任命我为第七圣殿的部长，这是在纽约市至关重要的位置。
I can't start to describe for you my welter of emotions. For Mr. Muhammad's teachings really toresurrect American black people, Islam obviously had to grow, to grow very big. And nowhere inAmerica was such a single temple potential available as in New York's five boroughs. 
我无法开始向您描述我的情感。因为穆罕默德先生的教学真的复活了美国黑人，伊斯兰教显然需要增长，变得非常庞大。在美国没有一个地方像纽约的五个行政区一样拥有如此潜在的单一圣殿。
They contained over a million black people. 
他们容纳了超过一百万的黑人。

It was nine years since West Indian Archie and I had been stalking the streets, momentarilyexpecting to try and shoot each other down like dogs. 
自从西印度群岛的阿尔奇和我在街上跟踪已经九年了，我们曾经短暂地期望着像狗一样互相开枪打斗。
"_Red!_"  . . ."My man!" . . ."Red, this _can't_ be you-With my natural kinky red hair now close- cropped, in place of the old long-haired, lye-cooked conk they had always known on my head, Iknow I looked much different. 
“_红色！_”......“我的兄弟！”......“红色，这不可能是你......”我的天然的卷曲红色头发现在被剪得很短，代替了他们一直知道在我头上的长而染过的头发，我知道我看起来大不相同。
 "Gim'me some _skin_, man! A drink here, bartender-what? You _quit!_ Aw, man, come off it!" 
“给我一些皮肤，伙计！这里喝的，酒保-什么？你退出了！啊，伙计，别这样！”
It was so good seeing so many whom I had known so well. You can understand how that was.But it was West Indian Archie and Sammy the Pimp for whom I was primarily looking. And the firstnasty shock came quickly, about Sammy. He had quit pimping, he had gotten pretty high up in thenumbers business, and was doing well. Sammy even had married. Some fast young girl. But thenshortly after his wedding one morning he was found lying dead across his bed-they said withtwenty-five thousand dollars in his pockets. (People don't want to believe the sums that even theminor underworld handles. Why, listen: in March 1964, a Chicago nickel-and-dime bets Wheel ofFortune man, Lawrence Wakefield, died, and over $760, 000 in cash was in his apartment, insacks and bags . . . all taken from poor Negroes . . . and we wonder why we stay so poor. ) 
能够看到这么多我认识的人真是太棒了。你可以理解那种感觉。但是我主要在寻找西印度群岛的阿尔奇和萨米，那个皮条客。第一个震撼很快就来了，是关于萨米的。他已经退出皮条客行业了，他在数字生意方面做得相当出色，而且很成功。萨米甚至已经结婚了，娶了一个年轻的女孩。但是在他结婚后不久的一个早上，人们发现他死在了他的床上——他们说他的口袋里有2.5万美元（人们不相信即使是黑帮分子也处理着如此庞大的金额。
Sick about Sammy, I queried from bar to bar among old-timers for West Indian Archie. The wirehadn't reported him dead, or living somewhere else, but none seemed to know where he was. Iheard the usual hustler fates of so many others. Bullets, knives, prison, dope, diseases, insanity,alcoholism. I imagine it was about in that order. And so many of the survivors whom I knew astough hyenas and wolves of the streets in the old days now were so pitiful. They had known allthe angles, but beneath that surface they were poor, ignorant, untrained black men; life hadeased up on them and hyped them. I ran across close to twenty-five of these old-timers I hadknown pretty well, who in the space of nine years had been reduced to the ghetto's minor,scavenger hustles to scratch up room rent and food money. Some now worked downtown,messengers, janitors, things like that. I was thankful to Allah that I had become a Muslim andescaped their fate. 
听到萨米的消息后，我在酒吧里向老手们打听西印度群岛的阿尔奇。电报没有报道他已经死了或者住在其他地方，但是似乎没有人知道他在哪里。我听到了其他人通常的命运：子弹、刀子、监狱、毒品、疾病、疯狂、酗酒。我想大概是这样的顺序。而且我知道的很多幸存者曾经是街头上的豺狼和野狗，现在却如此可怜。他们知道所有的角度，但是在表面之下他们是贫穷、无知、没有受过训练的黑人；生活已经减轻了对他们的压力并刺激了他们。我遇到了大约25个我曾经很熟悉的老手，他们在短短的九年时间里被迫沦为贫民窟中的次要、捡垃圾的小贩，以赚取房租和食物钱。有些人现在在市中心工作，如信使、清洁工等等。感谢真主，我成为了一个穆斯林并逃脱了他们的命运。
There was Cadillac Drake. He was a big jolly, cigar-smoking, fat, black, gaudy-dressing pimp, aregular afternoon character when I was waiting on tables in Small's Paradise. Well, I recognizedhim shuffling toward me on the street. He had gotten hooked on heroin; I'd heard that. He was thedirtiest, sloppiest bum you ever laid eyes on. I hurried past because we would both have beenembarrassed if he recognized me, the kid he used to toss a dollar tip. 
还有卡迪拉克·德雷克。他是一个大个子、愉快、抽着雪茄、胖乎乎的黑人，穿着华丽的衣服，当我在Small's Paradise的餐桌上等待时，他是那里一个常见的下午角色。嗯，我在街上认出了他，他向我走来。
The wire worked to locate West Indian Archie for me. The wire of the streets, when it wants to, issomething like Western Union with the F.B.I. for messengers. At one of my early services atTemple Seven, an old scavenger hustler, to whom I gave a few dollars, came up when serviceswere dismissed. He told me that West Indian Archie was sick, living up in a rented room in theBronx. 
电报帮我找到了西印度群岛的阿尔奇。当街头上的人们想要联系到某人时，就像联邦调查局用西联汇款给快递员传递信息一样。在我早期在第七圣殿服务的时候，有一个老式的捡垃圾的小贩来到我的面前，我给了他一些钱。当他的服务结束后，他告诉我西印度群岛的阿尔奇生病了，住在布朗克斯区的一个出租房里。
I took a taxi to the address. West Indian Archie opened the door. He stood there in rumpledpajamas and barefooted, squinting at me. 
我坐出租车去了那个地址。西印度群岛的阿尔奇打开了门。他穿着皱巴巴的睡衣，光着脚站在那里，眯着眼睛看着我。
Have you ever seen someone who seemed a ghost of the person you remembered? It took him afew seconds to fix me in his memory. He claimed, hoarsely, "Red! I'm so glad to see you!" 
你有没有见过一个人，他看起来就像你记忆中的幽灵？他花了几秒钟才把我牢牢地记在脑海里。他沙哑地说：“红色！很高兴见到你！”
I all but hugged the old man. He was sick in that weak way. I helped him back. He sat down onthe edge of his bed. I sat in his one chair, and I told him how his forcing me out of Harlem hadsaved my life by turning me in the direction of Islam. 
我几乎拥抱了那个老人。他虚弱得厉害。我帮他回到床上。他坐在床边的椅子上，我坐在另一把椅子上，告诉他他曾经强迫我离开哈莱姆，却把我引向了伊斯兰教，从而拯救了我的生命。
He said, "I always liked you, Red," and he said that he had never really wanted to kill me. I toldhim it had made me shudder many times to think how close we had come to killing each other. Itold him I had sincerely thought I had hit that combinated six-way number for the three hundreddollars he had paid me. Archie said that he had later wondered if he had made some mistake,since I was so ready to die about it. And then we agreed that it wasn't worth even talking about, itdidn't mean anything anymore. He kept saying, over and over,in between other things, that hewas so glad to see me. 
他说：“我总是喜欢你，红色。”他还说他从来没有真正想要杀死我。我告诉他，每当想到我们曾经多么接近于互相杀害时，我都感到毛骨悚然。我告诉他，自从那时起，我一直真诚地认为自己已经打出了一个六位数的组合，那是他付给我的三百美元。阿尔奇说他后来想知道自己是否犯了错误，因为我是如此渴望死亡。然后我们同意这甚至不值得谈论，它不再有意义了。他一直一遍又一遍地说着，在说其他事情之间，他很高兴见到我。
I went into a little of Mr. Muhammad's teaching with Archie. I told him how I had found out that allof us who had been in the streets were victims of the white man's society I told Archie what I hadthought in prison about him; that his brain, which could tape-record hundreds of numbercombinations a day, should have been put at the sendee of mathematics or science. "Red, thatsure is something to think about," I can remember him saying. 
我和阿尔奇一起听了穆罕默德先生的一节课。我告诉他，我已经发现我们所有在街上的人都成为了白人社会的受害者。我告诉阿尔奇我在监狱里对他的思考；他的大脑可以每天录制数百个数字组合，应该被用于数学或科学领域。我记得他说：“红色，这确实是值得思考的事情。”
But neither of us would say that it was not too late. I have the feeling that he knew, as I could see,that the end was closing in on Archie. I became too moved about what he had been and what hehad now become to be able to stay much longer. I didn't have much money, and he didn't want toaccept what little I was able to press on him. But I made him take it. 
但我们都没有说现在为时已晚。我有一种感觉，就像我所看到的那样，他知道阿尔奇的生命即将结束。我被他曾经的样子和他如今的样子感动得无法再呆下去。我没有多少钱，而他也不愿接受我能够给他的一点点帮助。但我还是让他收下了。
*     *     * 
I keep having to remind myself that then, in June 1954, Temple Seven in New York City was alittle storefront. Why, it's almost unbelievable that one bus couldn't have been filled with theMuslims in New York City! Even among our own black people in the Harlem ghetto, you couldhave said "Muslim" to a thousand, and maybe only one would not have asked you "What's that?"As for white people, except for that relative handful privy to certain police or prison files, not fivehundred white people in all of America knew we existed. 
我不断提醒自己，在1954年6月，纽约市的第七寺庙只是一家小店。难以置信的是，一辆公共汽车竟然不能坐满纽约市的穆斯林！即使在我们自己的哈莱姆贫民窟中的黑人中，你也可以对一千人说“穆斯林”，也许只有一个不会问你“那是什么？”至于白人，除了那些了解某些警方或监狱文件的少数人之外，全美国没有五百人知道我们的存在。
I began firing Mr. Muhammad's teaching at the New York members and the few friends theymanaged to bring in. And with each meeting, my discomfort grew that in Harlem, choked withpoor, ignorant black men suffering all of the evils that Islam could cure, every time I lectured myheart out and then asked those who wanted to follow Mr. Muhammad to stand, only two or threewould. And, I have to admit, sometimes not that many.I think I was all the angrier with my own ineffectiveness because I knew the streets. I had to getmyself together and think out the problem. And the big trouble, obviously, was that we were onlyone among the many voices of black discontent on every busy Harlem corner. The differentNationalist groups, the "Buy Black!" forces, and others like that; dozens of their step-ladderorators were trying to increase their followings. I had nothing against anyone trying to promoteindependence and unity among black men, but they still were making it tough for Mr.Muhammad's voice to be heard. 
我开始向纽约的成员和他们设法带来的少数朋友讲授穆罕默德先生的课程。每次会议，我越来越感到不安，因为哈莱姆充斥着受贫穷、无知的黑人折磨的可怜的人，他们遭受着伊斯兰教所能治愈的所有邪恶。每次我在演讲中尽情倾诉后，要求那些想跟随穆罕默德的人站起来，只有两三个人会这样做。我必须承认，有时甚至没有那么多。我想我对自己无能的愤怒是因为我知道这些街道。我必须使自己振作起来，思考解决问题的办法。显而易见，最大的问题是我们只是每个繁忙的哈莱姆街角上众多黑人不满声音之一。不同的民族主义团体、“购买黑人！”力量和其他类似的组织；他们的几十个阶梯式讲者试图增加他们的追随者。我没有任何反对任何人在黑人中间促进独立和团结的意图，但他们仍然使穆罕默德的声音难以被听到。
In my first effort to get over this hurdle, I had some little leaflets printed. There wasn't a much- traveled Harlem street corner that five or six good Muslim brothers and I missed. We would stepup right in front of a walking black man or woman so that they had to accept our leaflet, and ifthey hesitated one second, they had to hear us saying some catch thing such as "Hear how thewhite man kidnapped and robbed and raped our black race-" 
为了克服这个障碍，我首次尝试印制了一些小传单。没有一个经过多次宣传的哈莱姆街角是我们没有去过的。我们会在一位行走的黑人或白人面前停下来，让他们不得不接受我们的传单，如果他们犹豫一秒钟，就必须听到我们说一些引人注目的事情，例如“听到白人如何绑架、抢劫和强奸我们黑人种族-”
Next, we went to work "fishing" on those Harlem corners-on the fringes of the Nationalistmeetings. The method today has many refinements, but then it consisted of working the alwaysshifting edges of the audiences that others had managed to draw. At a Nationalist meeting,everyone who was listening was interested in the revolution of the black race. We began to getvisible results almost immediately after we began thrusting handbills in people's hands, "Come tohear us, too, brother. 
接下来，我们开始在哈莱姆街角上“钓鱼”，即在民族主义会议的边缘进行宣传。今天的方法有很多改进，但它包括了工作一直在不断变化的边缘的观众，这些观众已经被其他人吸引过来。在一次民族主义会议上，每个正在听的人都对黑人种族的革命感兴趣。在我们开始向人们递送传单后，几乎立即就开始看到明显的结果， “来听听我们的话吧，兄弟。”
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us how to cure the black man's spiritual, mental,moral, economic, and political sicknesses-" 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生教导我们如何治愈黑人的精神上的、心理上的、道德上的、经济上的和政治上的疾病。
I saw the new faces of our Temple Seven meetings. And then we discovered the best "fishing"audience of all, by far the best-conditioned audience for Mr. Muhammad's teachings: theChristian churches.Our Sunday services were held at two P. M. All over Harlem during the hour or so before that,Christian church services were dismissing. We by-passed the larger churches with their higherratio of so-called "middle-class" Negroes who were so full of pretense and "status" that theywouldn't be caught in our little storefront. 
我看到了我们第七寺庙会议的新面孔。然后我们发现最好的“垂钓”观众，迄今为止最适合穆罕默德先生教导的观众：基督教会。我们的周日礼拜在下午2点举行。在那个小时之前，整个哈莱姆区都有基督教堂的礼拜活动结束。我们避开了那些更大的教堂，那里有更多的所谓的“中产阶级”黑人，他们充满了虚伪和“地位”，不会被我们的小店面所吸引。
We went "fishing" fast and furiously when those little evangelical storefront churches each let outtheir thirty to fifty people on the sidewalk. "Come to hear us, brother, sister-" "You haven't heardanything until you have heard the teachings of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad-" TheseCongregations were usually Southern migrant people, usually older, who would go anywhere tohear what they called "good preaching." These were the church congregations who were alwaysputting out little signs announcing that inside they were selling fried chicken and chitlin dinners toraise some money. And three or four nights a week, they were in their storefront rehearsing forthe next Sunday, I guess, shaking and rattling and rolling the gospels with their guitars andtambourines. 
我们快速而猛烈地“垂钓”那些小型福音派店面教会，每个教会都在人行道上让三十到五十人出来。 “来听听我们的话吧，兄弟，姐妹们-” “你还没有听过任何东西，直到你听过伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生的教导。”这些聚会通常来自南方移民，通常是年龄较大的人，他们会去任何地方听他们所谓的“好讲道”。这些是教堂会众，他们总是张贴小标志，宣布他们在内部出售炸鸡和猪蹄晚餐以筹集一些钱。我猜每三四个晚上，他们都在自己的店面里为下一个星期日排练，摇晃和击打着吉他和手鼓来演奏福音书。
I don't know if you know it, but there's a whole circuit of commercial gospel entertainers who havecome out of these little churches in the city ghettoes or from down South. People such as SisterRosetta Tharpe, The Clara Ward Singers are examples, and there must be five hundred lesserlights of the same general order. Mahalia Jackson, the greatest of them all-she was a preacher'sdaughter in Louisiana. She came up there to Chicago where she worked cooking and scrubbingfor white people and then in a factory while she sang in the Negro churches the gospel style that,when it caught on, made her the first Negro that Negroes ever made famous. She was sellinghundreds of thousands of records among Negroes before white people ever knew who MahaliaJackson was. Anyway, I know that somewhere I once read that Mahalia said that every time shecan, she will slip unannounced into some little ghetto storefront churchand sing with her people.She calls that "my filling station." 
我不知道你是否知道，但是有一整条商业福音娱乐人员已经从城市贫民窟中的小教堂里出来，或者来自南方。例如，罗斯塔·撒佩、克拉拉·沃德歌手等人，还有大约五百个同样类型的伟大灵光。马利亚·杰克逊是她父亲在路易斯安那州的牧师女儿。她去了芝加哥，在那里为白人做饭和擦洗，然后在一家工厂唱歌，用黑人教堂的福音风格演唱。当它流行起来时，她成为了第一个著名的黑人。在白人认识马利亚·杰克逊之前，她就在非洲人中卖出了成千上万的唱片。总之，我知道我曾经在哪里读到过一句话：马利亚说每次她可以的时候，她都会悄悄地溜进一些小型贫民窟店面教会与她的人民一起唱歌。她称之为“我的加油站”。
The black Christians we "fished" to our Temple were conditioned, I found, by the very shock Icould give them about what had been happening to them while they worshiped a blond, blue- eyed God. I knew the temple that I could build if I could really get to those Christians. I tailoredthe teachings for them. I would start to speak and sometimes be so emotionally charged I had toexplain myself: 
我们发现，那些我们“垂钓”到我们第七寺庙的黑人基督徒们已经受到了一些影响。 当他们在崇拜一个金发碧眼的神的时候，我能够给他们带来的震惊让我发现这一点。我知道如果我能够真正接触到这些基督徒，我就能够建造一座寺庙。我为这些人量身定制了教义。我开始讲话，有时候情绪太过激动，我不得不解释自己：
"You see my tears, brothers and sisters .  . . . Tears haven't been in my eyes since I was a youngboy. But I cannot help this when I feel the responsibility I have to help you comprehend for thefirst time what this white man's religion that we call Christianity has _done_ to us . . . . 
“你们看到我的眼泪，兄弟姐妹们.......从我还是个小男孩起，我的眼里就没有泪水。但是当我感受到我必须帮助你们第一次理解这个白人的宗教——我们称之为基督教——对我们所做的一切时，我无法控制自己......”
"Brothers and sisters here for the first time, please don't let that shock you. I know you didn'texpect this. Because almost none of us black people have thought that maybe we were making amistake not wondering if there wasn't a special religion somewhere for us-a special religion forthe black man. 
“第一次来这儿的兄弟姐妹们，请不要被那种震惊所吓倒。我知道你们没有料到这一点。因为我们中的几乎每一个人都没有想过我们是否犯了错误，而不是在想是否在某个地方有一种特殊的宗教——一种专门为黑人准备的宗教。”
"Well, there is such a religion. It's called Islam. Let me spell it for you, I-s-I-a-m! _Islam!_ But I'mgoing to tell you about Islam a little later. First, we need to understand some things about thisChristianity before we can understand why the _answer_ for us is Islam. 
“嗯，确实有一种宗教。它被称为伊斯兰教。让我为您拼写一下，I-s-i-a-m！ _Islam！_ 但是我会稍后再向您介绍伊斯兰教。首先，我们需要了解一些基督教的事情，才能理解为什么对于我们来说，答案是伊斯兰教。”
"Brothers and sisters, the white man has brainwashed us black people to fasten our gaze upon ablond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus! We're worshiping a Jesus that doesn't even _look_ like us! Oh,yes! Now just bear with me, listen to the teachings of the Messenger of Allah, The HonorableElijah Muhammad. Now, just think of this. The blond-haired, blue-eyed white man has taught youand me to worship a _white_ Jesus, and to shout and sing and pray to this God that's _his_ God,the white man's God. The white man has taught us to shoutand sing and pray until we _die_, towait until _death_, for some dreamy heaven-in-the-hereafter, when we're _dead_, while this whiteman has his milk and honey in the streets paved with golden dollars right here on _this_ earth! 
“兄弟姐妹们，这个白人已经对我们黑人进行了洗脑，让我们只能凝视着一个金发碧眼的耶稣！我们崇拜的耶稣甚至看起来不像我们！哦，是的！现在请耐心听我讲解，倾听阿拉的使者、尊贵的伊莱贾·穆罕默德所传达的教义。现在，请想一想。那个金发碧眼的白人已经教给我们和你们去崇拜一个 _白人_ 的耶稣，并高喊、吟唱、祈祷这个属于他的上帝——白人的上帝。白人教导我们要一直高喊、吟唱、祈祷，直到我们死去，等待某种虚幻的天堂，当我们死后，而这个白人却在他的街道上享受着他的牛奶和蜂蜜，用金色的美元铺就了这条道路，就在这个地球上！”
"You don't want to believe what I am telling you, brothers and sisters? Well, I'll tell you what youdo. You go out of here, you just take a good look around where you live. Look at not only how_you_ live, but look at how anybody that you _know_ lives-that way, you'll be sure that you're notjust a bad-luck accident. And when you get through looking at where _you_ live, then you takeyou a walk down across Central Park, and start to look at what this white God had brought to thewhite man. I mean, take yourself a look down there at how the white man is living! 
“你们不相信我要告诉你们的事情，兄弟姐妹们？那么，我会告诉你们该怎么做。你们走出这里，好好看看你们生活的环境。不仅要看你们自己的生活方式，还要看看你认识的任何人的生活方式——这样，你就会确信自己不是偶然的不幸。当你看完自己的生活环境后，你可以步行穿过中央公园，开始看看这个白人上帝为白人带来了什么。我的意思是，看看那个白人是如何生活的！
"And don't stop there. In fact, you won't be able to stop for long-his doormen are going to tell you'Move on!' But catch a subway and keep on downtown. Anywhere you may want to get off, _look_at the white man's apartments, businesses! Go right on down to the tip of Manhattan Island thatthis devilish white man stole from the trusting Indians for twenty-four dollars! Look at his City Hall,down there; look at his Wall Street! Look at yourself! Look at _his_ God!" 
“不要止步于此。事实上，你不可能长久地停下来——门童们会告诉你‘走吧！’但是你可以坐地铁继续往市中心走。在你想要下车的任何地方， _看看_ 白人的公寓和商业区！一直走到曼哈顿岛的尽头，那个邪恶的白人从善良的印第安人手中偷走了这块土地，只花了24美元！看看他的市政厅，在那里；看看他的华尔街！看看你自己！看看 _他的_ 上帝！”
I had learned early one important thing, and that was to always teach in terms that the peoplecould understand. Also, where the Nationalists whom we had "fished" were almost all men,among the storefront Christians, a heavy preponderance were women, and I had the sense tooffer something special for them. "_Beautiful_ black woman! The Honorable Elijah Muhammadteaches us that the black man is going around saying he wants respect; well, the black mannever will get anybody's respect until he first learns to respect his own women! The black manneeds _today_ to stand up and throw off the weaknesses imposed upon him by the slavemasterwhite man! The black man needs to start today to shelter and protect and _respect_ his blackwomen!"One hundred percent would stand up without hesitation when I said, "How many _believe_ whatthey have heard?" But still never more than an agonizing few would stand up when I invited, "Willthose stand who want to _follow_ The Honorable Elijah Muhammad?"I knew that our strict moral code and discipline was what repelled them most. I fired at this point,at the reason for our code. "The white man _wants_ black men to stay immoral, unclean andignorant. As long as we stay in these conditions we will keep on begging him and he will controlus. We never can win freedom and justice and equality until we are doing something forourselves!" 
“我很早就学到了一个重要的事情，那就是要始终用人们能够理解的语言来教导。此外，我们钓到的国民党人几乎都是男性，而在我们的店面基督徒中，妇女占据了绝大多数，我有意识到要为她们提供一些特别的东西。”“美丽的黑人女性！尊敬的伊莱贾·穆罕默德教导我们，黑人到处都在说他想得到尊重；但是，黑人永远不会得到任何人的尊重，直到他首先学会尊重自己的女性！黑人今天需要站起来，摆脱奴隶主白人强加给他的弱点！黑人今天需要开始保护、尊重和庇护他的黑人女性！”当我问道：“有多少人相信他们所听到的？”时，百分之百的人会毫不犹豫地站起来。但是当我邀请：“那些想跟随尊敬的伊莱贾·穆罕默德的人请站起来。”时，只有极少数人会站起来。我知道我们的严格道德规范和纪律是他们最反感的。在这一点上，我开始抨击我们的道德规范的原因。 “白人希望黑人保持不道德、肮脏和无知。只要我们处于这些状态，我们就会不断地向他乞求，他将控制我们。除非我们自己为自己争取自由、正义和平等，否则我们将永远无法获得它们！”
The code, of course, had to be explained to any who were tentatively interested in becomingMuslims. And the word got around in their little storefronts quickly, which is why they would cometo hear me, yet wouldn't join Mr. Muhammad. Any fornication was absolutely forbidden in theNation of Islam. Any eating of the filthy pork, or other injurious or unhealthful foods; any use oftobacco, alcohol, or narcotics. No Muslim who followed Elijah Muhammad could dance, gamble,date, attend movies, or sports, or take long vacations from work. Muslims slept no more thanhealth required. Any domestic quarreling, any discourtesy, especially to women, was not allowed.No lying or stealing, and no insubordination to civil authority, except on the grounds of religiousobligation. 
当然，这个道德规范必须向任何有初步兴趣成为穆斯林的人解释。这个消息很快在他们的小店传开了，这就是为什么他们会来听我讲道，但不会加入穆罕默德先生的原因。在伊斯兰教国中，任何通奸行为都是绝对禁止的。任何食用肮脏的猪肉或其他有害或不健康的食物；任何使用烟草、酒精或麻醉剂的行为。遵循伊莱贾·穆罕默德的穆斯林不能跳舞、赌博、约会、看电影或体育比赛，也不能长时间地从工作中休假。穆斯林的睡眠时间不得超过健康所需的时间。不允许任何家庭争吵、任何粗鲁行为，尤其是对妇女的粗鲁行为。不允许撒谎或偷窃，也不允许对民事当局不服从，除非是出于宗教义务。
Our moral laws were policed by our Fruit of Islam-able, dedicated, and trained Muslim men.Infractions resulted in suspension by Mr. Muhammad, or isolation for various periods, or evenexpulsion for the worst offenses "from the only group that really cares about you." 
我们的道德规范由我们的“伊斯兰果实”来维护，这些果实是虔诚的、受过训练的穆斯林男子。违规行为会导致穆罕默德先生的停职、一段时间的孤立，甚至是最恶劣的罪行被“从真正关心你的群体中驱逐出去”。

 Temple Seven grew somewhat with each meeting. It just grew too slowly to suit me. During theweekdays, I traveled by bus and train. I taught each Wednesday at Philadelphia's Temple Twelve.I went to Springfield, Massachusetts, to try to start a new temple. A temple which Mr. Muhammadnumbered Thirteen was established there with the help of Brother Osborne, who had first heardof Islam from me in prison. A lady visiting a Springfield meeting asked if I'd come to Hartford,where she lived; she specified the next Thursday and said she would assemble some friends.And I was right there. 
第七圣殿在每次聚会中都有所增长，但它增长得太慢，不符合我的心意。在工作日，我乘坐公共汽车和火车旅行。每周三，我在费城的第12座圣殿授课。我前往马萨诸塞州的斯普林菲尔德，尝试建立一座新圣殿。在奥斯本弟兄的帮助下，这座被穆罕默德先生编号为第十三的圣殿在那里建立起来了。奥斯本弟兄最初是在我坐牢时从我这里第一次听到伊斯兰教的。一位前来参观斯普林菲尔德聚会的女士询问我是否愿意前往她居住的哈特福德；她指定了下周四，并说她将召集一些朋友。而我正好在那里。
Thursday is traditionally domestic servants' day off. This sister had in her housing projectapartment about fifteen of the maids, cooks, chauffeurs and house men who worked for theHartford-area white people. You've heard that saying, "No man is a hero to his valet." Well, thoseNegroes who waited on wealthy whites hand and foot opened their eyes quicker than mostNegroes. And when they went "fishing" enough among more servants, and other black people inand around Hartford, Mr. Muhammad before long was able to assign a Hartford temple thenumber Fourteen. And every Thursday I scheduled my teaching there. 
星期四是传统上佣人休假的日子。这位姐妹在住房项目中为哈特福德地区的白人拥有一个公寓，大约有15名女佣、厨师、司机和男管家为他们工作。你听说过这句话吗，“没有人对他的仆人是英雄。”那些为富有的白人提供全方位服务的黑人比其他黑人更快地开了眼界。当他们足够多地从其他仆人和其他黑人中“钓鱼”时，不久之后穆罕默德先生就能够为哈特福德地区分配第14座圣殿了。每个星期四我都在那里安排我的授课时间。
Mr. Muhammad, when I went to see him in Chicago, had to chastise me on some point duringnearly every visit. I just couldn't keep from showing in some manner that with his ministersequipped with the power of his message, I felt the Nation should go much faster. His patience andhis wisdom in chastising me would always humble me from head to foot. He said, one time, thatno true leader burdened his followers with a greater load than they could carry, and no true leadersets too fast a pace for his followers to keep up. 
当我在芝加哥拜访穆罕默德先生时，几乎每次拜访他都必须在某些方面训斥我。我无法掩饰自己以某种方式表现出来的感受，即他的牧师们掌握了他信息的力量，我觉得国家应该更快地前进。他训斥我的耐心和智慧总是让我感到自卑。有一次，他说没有一个真正的领袖会让他的粉丝承担超过他们能够承受的负担，也没有一个真正的领袖会让粉丝跟不上他的步伐。
"Most people seeing a man in an old touring car going real slow think the man doesn't want to gofast," Mr. Muhammad said, "but the man knows that to drive any faster would destroy the old car.When he gets a fast car, then he will drive at a fast speed." And I remember him telling meanother time, when I complained about an inefficient minister at one of his mosques, "I wouldrather have a mule I can depend upon than a race horse that I can't depend upon." 
“大多数人看到一个男人开着一辆老旧的旅游车开得很慢，认为那个男人不想走得快，”穆罕默德先生说，“但那个男人知道，以任何更快的速度开车都会破坏这辆旧车。当他有了一辆快速的车子时，他会以快速的速度行驶。”我记得有一次我抱怨他在一个清真寺里有一位效率低下的牧师时，他告诉我：“我宁愿要一匹可靠的骡子，也不要一匹不能信赖的比赛马。”
I knew that Mr. Muhammad _wanted_ that fast car to drive. And I don't think you could pick thesame number of faithful brothers and sisters from the Nation of Islam today and find "fishing"teams to beat the efforts of those who helped to bring growth to the Boston, Philadelphia,Springfield, Hartford, and New York temples. I'm, of course, just mentioning those that I knewmost about because I was directly involved. This was through 1955. And 1955 was the year Imade my first trip of any distance. It was to help open the temple that today is Number Fifteen-inAtlanta, Georgia. 
我知道穆罕默德先生想要开那辆快速的车子。而且我认为，今天在伊斯兰国家中，你不可能找到同样数量的忠实兄弟姐妹，并找到“钓鱼”小组来击败那些帮助波士顿、费城、斯普林菲尔德、哈特福德和纽约圣殿成长的人们的努力。当然，我只是提到那些我最熟悉的人，因为我直接参与了其中。这是通过1955年。1955年是我进行第一次长途旅行的一年。我前往佐治亚州的亚特兰大，帮助开放今天第15座圣殿。
Any Muslim who ever moved for personal reasons from one city to another was of courseexhorted to plant seeds for Mr. Muhammad. Brother James X, one of our top Temple Twelvebrothers, had interested enough black people in Atlanta so that when Mr. Muhammad wasadvised, he told me to go to Atlanta and hold a first meeting. I think I have had a hand in most ofMr. Muhammad's temples, but I'll never forget that opening in Atlanta. 
任何因为个人原因从一个城市搬到另一个城市的穆斯林都被敦促为穆罕默德先生播下种子。我们第十二圣殿的其中一位最高级别的兄弟詹姆斯· X ，已经在亚特兰大引起了足够多的黑人的兴趣，以至于当穆罕默德先生被建议时，他告诉我前往亚特兰大并主持第一次会议。我想我在穆罕默德先生的大多数圣殿中都有所贡献，但我永远不会忘记在亚特兰大的开幕。
A funeral parlor was the only place large enough that Brother James X could afford to rent.Everything that the Nation of Islam did in those days, from Mr. Muhammad on down, was strictlyon a shoestring. When we all arrived, though, a Christian Negro's funeral was just d ismissing, sowe had to wait awhile, and we watched the mourners out. 
殡仪馆是唯一一家足够大，足以让詹姆斯 X 兄弟租得起的地方。从穆罕默德先生到下面的每一个人，那个时期的伊斯兰国家所做的每一件事情都是严格地在预算内完成的。然而当我们都到达时，一个基督教黑人的葬礼正在错过，所以我们不得不等待一段时间，然后我们看着哀悼者离开。
"You saw them all crying over their physical dead," I told our group when we got inside. "But theNation of Islam is rejoicing over you, our mentally dead. That may shock you, but, oh, yes, youjust don't realize how our whole black race in America is mentally dead. We are here today withMr. Elijah Muhammad's teachings which resurrect the black man from the dead . . . ."And,speaking of funerals, I should mention that we never failed to get some new Muslims when non- Muslims, family and friends of a Muslim deceased, attended our short, moving ceremony thatillustrated Mr. Muhammad's teaching, "Christians have their funerals for the living, ours are for ourdeparted." 
“你们看到他们所有人都在为他们的身体死亡而哭泣，”当我们进入内部时，我对我们这个小组说。 “但是伊斯兰国家正在为我们的精神上的死亡而欢庆。这可能会让你震惊，但是，是的，你只是没有意识到我们整个美国黑人种族的精神上是如何死亡的。我们今天在这里带着伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生的教义而来，这些教义将黑人从死亡中复活…….”“说到葬礼，我应该提到，每当非穆斯林人士、穆斯林死者的家人和朋友参加我们的简短而感人的仪式时，我们从未错过一些新的穆斯林。这个仪式展示了穆罕默德先生的教义，即‘基督徒为活着的人举行葬礼，我们的是为了已故的人而举行的’。”
As the minister of several temples, conducting the Muslim ceremony had occasionally fallen tomy lot. As Mr. Muhammad had taught me, I would start by reading over the casket of the departedbrother or sister a prayer to Allah. Next I read a simple obituary record of his or her life. Then Iusually read from Job; two passages, in the seventh and fourteenth chapters, where Job speaksof no life after death. Then another passage where David, when his son died, spoke also of no lifeafter death. 
作为几个圣殿的部长，有时我需要主持穆斯林仪式。正如穆罕默德先生教导我的一样，我会先阅读已故兄弟或姐妹的棺材上的一段祷告，向真主安拉致敬。接下来，我会读一份简单的生平记录。然后，通常会从《约伯记》中引用两段话，即第七和第十四章，其中约伯谈到死后没有生命。接着是大卫在儿子去世时所说的另一段话，他同样谈到死后没有生命。
To the audience before me, I explained why no tears were to be shed, and why we had noflowers, or singing, or organ-playing. "We shed tears for our brother, and gave him our music andour tears while he was alive. If he wasn't wept for and given our music and flowers then, well, nowthere is no need, because he is no longer aware. We now will give his family any money we mighthave spent." 
“对于我面前的观众，我解释了为什么不应该流泪，为什么我们没有花、没有唱歌、没有管风琴演奏。 “我们在活着的时候为我们的兄弟哭泣，并给他我们的音乐和我们的泪水。如果他没有被哭泣并为他提供我们的音乐和鲜花，那么好吧，现在没有必要了，因为他不再有意识了。我们现在将把他的家人可能花掉的任何钱都给他们。”
Appointed Muslim Sisters quickly passed small trays from which everyone took a thin, round pattyof peppermint candy. At my signal, the candy was put into mouths. "We will file by now for a lastlook at our brother. We won't cry-just as we don't cry over candy. Just as this sweet candy willdissolve, so will our brother's sweetness that we have enjoyed when he lived now dissolve into asweetness in our memories." 
被指定的穆斯林姐妹们迅速地传递着小盘子，每个人都从中取了一片薄薄的、圆圆的薄荷糖。在我的信号下，这些糖果被放进嘴里。“现在我们要去最后一次看看我们的兄弟。我们不会哭泣——就像我们不会因为糖果而哭泣一样。就像这个甜美的糖果会溶解一样，我们曾经在他生前所享受的他的甜蜜也会溶解成我们记忆中的甜蜜。”
I have had probably a couple of hundred Muslims tell me that it was attending one of our funeralsfor a departed brother or sister that first turned them toward Allah. But I was to learn later that Mr.Muhammad's teaching about death andthe Muslim funeral service was in drastic contradiction towhat Islam taught in the East. 
我可能已经遇到了几百个穆斯林，他们告诉我，是出席我们的一个葬礼，为已故的兄弟或姐妹而哭泣，让他们第一次转向真主安拉。但是后来我了解到，穆罕默德先生关于死亡和穆斯林葬礼仪式的教导与伊斯兰教在东方所教导的内容存在巨大矛盾。
We had grown, by 1956-well, sizable. Every temple had "fished" with enough success that therewere far more Muslims, especially in the major cities of Detroit, Chicago, and New York thananyone would have guessed from the outside. In fact, as you know, in the really big cities, youcan have a very big organization and, if it makes no public show, or noise, no one will necessarilybe aware that it is around. 
到1956年，我们已经发展成为一个相当大的组织。每个圣殿都“钓鱼”得很成功，以至于有远超过外部想象的穆斯林，特别是在底特律、芝加哥和纽约等主要城市。事实上，正如您所知，在非常大的城市中，您可以拥有一个非常庞大的组织，如果它不进行公开表演或噪音，那么没有人会意识到它的存在。
But more than just increasing in numbers, Mr. Muhammad's version of Islam now had beengetting in some other types of black people. We began now getting those with some education,both academic, and vocations and trades, and even some with "positions" in the white world, andall of this was starting to bring us closer to the desired fast car for Mr. Muhammad to drive. Wehad, for instance, some civil servants, some nurses, clerical workers, salesmen from thedepartment stores. And one of the best things was that some brothers of this type weredeveloping into smart, fine, aggressive young ministers for Mr. Muhammad. 
但是，不仅仅是人数的增加，穆罕默德先生所信奉的伊斯兰教现在已经开始吸引其他类型的黑人加入。我们现在开始吸引那些受过教育的人，无论是学术、职业和贸易方面的，甚至是在白人世界中拥有“职位”的人，所有这些都开始使我们更接近穆罕默德先生所期望驾驶的豪华轿车。例如，我们有公务员、护士、文职人员和百货商店的销售员。其中最好的是，这些类型的一些兄弟们正在发展成为聪明、优秀、有攻击性的年青部长为穆罕默德先生服务。
I went without a lot of sleep trying to merit his increasing evidences of trust and confidence in myefforts to help build our Nation of Islam. It was in 1956 that Mr. Muhammad was able to authorizeTemple Seven to buy and assign for my use a new Chevrolet. (The car was the Nation's, notmine. I had nothing that was mine but my clothes, wrist watch, and suitcase. As in the case of allof the Nation's ministers, my living expenses were paid and I had some pocket money. Whereonce you couldn't have named anything I wouldn't have done for money, now money was the lastthing to cross my mind.) Anyway, in letting me know about the car, Mr. Muhammad told me heknew how I loved to roam, planting seeds for new Muslims, or more temples, so he didn't wantme to be tied down.In five months, I put about 30, 000 miles of "fishing" on that car before I had an accident. Late onenight a brother and I were coming through Weathersfield, Connecticut, when I stopped for a redlight and a car smashed into me from behind. I was just shook up, not hurt. That excited devil hada woman with him, hiding her face, so I knew she wasn't his wife. We were exchanging ouridentification (he lived in Meriden, Connecticut) when the police arrived, and their actions told mehe was somebody important. I later found out he was one of Connecticut's most prominentpoliticians; I won't call his name. Anyway, Temple Seven settled on a lawyer's advice, and thatmoney went down on an Oldsmobile, the make of car I've been driving ever since. 
我为了争取他越来越多的信任和对我努力帮助建立伊斯兰国家的信任而牺牲了很多睡眠。1956年，穆罕默德先生授权第七圣殿为我购买并分配了一辆新的雪佛兰车。（这辆车是国家的，不是我的。我只有衣服、手表和行李箱是属于我自己的，除此之外，我没有任何财产。以前只要是有钱的事情我都愿意做，现在钱已经不在我考虑范围内了。）无论如何，在告诉我关于这辆车的事情时，穆罕默德先生告诉我他知道我喜欢漫游，为新的穆斯林或更多的寺庙“钓鱼”，所以他不想让我被束缚。在五个月的时间里，我在那辆车上跑了大约三万公里，直到发生了一起事故。一天晚上，我和一个兄弟开车经过威瑟斯菲尔德，康涅狄格州，我停下来等红灯时，一辆车从后面撞了我。我只是受了点惊吓，没有受伤。那个兴奋的恶魔有一个女人和他在一起，她遮住了自己的脸，所以我知道他并不是她的丈夫。当我们正在交换身份证明时（他住在康涅狄格州的梅迪恩），警察赶到了现场，他们的行为告诉我他是个重要人物。后来我发现他是康涅狄格州最杰出的政治家之一；我不会说出他的名字。总之，根据律师的建议，第七圣殿支付了这笔钱，这笔钱用于购买了一辆奥兹莫比尔车，那是我从那时起一直驾驶的车型。
*     *     * 
I had always been very careful to stay completely clear of any personal closeness with any of theMuslim sisters. My total commitment to Islam demanded having no other interests, especially, Ifelt, no women. In almost every temple at least one single sister had let out some broad hint thatshe thought I needed a wife. So I always made it clear that marriage had no interest for mewhatsoever; I was too busy. 
我一直非常小心，完全避免与任何穆斯林姐妹建立个人亲密关系。我对伊斯兰教的全面承诺要求我没有其他兴趣，特别是没有女人。在几乎所有的圣殿里，至少有一位姐妹暗示她认为我需要一个妻子。因此我总是明确表示，婚姻对我来说没有任何意义；我太忙了。
Every month, when I went to Chicago, I would find that some sister had written complaining to Mr.Muhammad that I talked so hard against women when I taught our special classes about thedifferent natures of the two sexes. Now, Islam has very strict laws and teachings about women,the core of them being that the true nature of a man is to be strong, and a woman's true nature isto be weak, and while a man must at all times respect his woman, at the same time he needs tounderstand that he must control her if he expects to get her respect. 
每个月，当我去芝加哥时，我都会发现自己的某个姐妹写信给穆罕默德先生抱怨说我在教授我们关于男女两性不同性质的特别课程时，对女性进行了严厉的批评。现在，伊斯兰教对于女性有非常严格的法律和教义，其中核心是男人的真实本性是要强大，而女人的真实本性是要柔弱，同时，男人必须时刻尊重他的女人，但同时他需要理解，如果他期望得到她的尊重，就必须控制她。
But in those days I had my own personal reasons. I wouldn't have considered it possible for me tolove any woman. I'd had too much experience that womenwere only tricky, deceitful,untrustworthy flesh. I had seen too many men ruined, or at least tied down, or in some other waymessed up by women. Women talked too much. To tell a woman not to talk too much was liketelling Jesse James not to carry a gun, or telling a hen not to cackle. Can you imagine JesseJames without a gun, or a hen that didn't cackle? And for anyone in any kind of a leadershipposition, such as I was, the worst thing in the world that he could have was the wrong woman.Even Samson, the world's strongest man, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.She was the one whose words hurt him. 
但是在那些日子里，我有我自己的私人原因。我不可能考虑自己会爱上任何一个女人。我经历过太多的女人都是狡猾、欺骗、不可信任的肉体。我见过太多的男性被毁掉，或者至少被束缚住，或者以某种方式被女性所破坏。女人总是喜欢说话。告诉一个女人不要说话就像告诉杰西·詹姆斯不要带枪，或者告诉一只鸡不要咯咯叫一样荒谬。你能想象没有枪的杰西·詹姆斯，或者不会咯咯叫的鸡吗？对于任何人来说，尤其是像我这样的领导地位的人，世界上最糟糕的事情就是拥有一个错误的女人。即使是全世界最强壮的男子，也被他怀里睡觉的女人所摧毁。她的言语伤害了他。
I mean, I'd had so much experience. I had talked to too many prostitutes and mistresses. Theyknew more about a whole lot of husbands than the wives of those husbands did. The wivesalways filled their husbands' ears so full of wife complaints that it wasn't the wives, it was theprostitutes and mistresses who heard the husbands' innermost problems and secrets. Theythought of him, and comforted him, and that included listening to him, and so he would tell themeverything. 
我的意思是，我已经有太多经验了。我和太多的妓女和情妇交谈过。她们比那些丈夫的妻子更加了解许多丈夫的事情。妻子总是向丈夫的耳朵里灌输着妻子的抱怨，以至于不是妻子，而是妓女和情妇听到了丈夫最深处的问题和秘密。她们想到他，安慰他，并且包括倾听他，所以他会告诉她们一切。
Anyway, it had been ten years since I thought anything about any mistress, I guess, and as aminister now, I was thinking even less about getting any wife. And Mr. Muhammad himselfencouraged me to stay single. 
无论如何，我想我已经有十年没有考虑过任何情妇的事情了，我猜，而且现在作为一名部长，我甚至更少地考虑要娶任何妻子。穆罕默德先生本人鼓励我保持单身。
Temple Seven sisters used to tell brothers, "You're just staying single because Brother MinisterMalcolm never looks at anybody." No, I didn't make it any secret to any of those sisters, how I felt.And, yes, I did tell the brothers to be very, very careful. 
第七圣殿的姐妹们经常告诉弟兄们：“你们单身是因为牧师马尔科姆从不看任何人。”不，我没有向那些姐妹透露我的感受。是的，我确实告诉弟兄们要非常、非常小心。
This sister-well, in 1956, she joined Temple Seven. I just noticed her, not with the slightestinterest, you understand. For about the next year, I just noticed her. You know, she never wouldhave dreamed I was even thinking about her. In fact, probably you couldn't have convinced her Ieven knew her name. It wasSister Betty X. She was tall, brown-skinned-darker than I was. Andshe had brown eyes. 
这位姐妹——1956年，她加入了第七圣殿。我只是注意到了她，没有任何兴趣，你明白的。在接下来的一年里，我只是注意到了她。你知道，她从没有想过我会想到她。事实上，你可能无法说服她我相信她知道我的名字。她的名字叫Betty X. sister。她很高，皮肤棕色——比我还要深。她有棕色的眼睛。
I knew she was a native of Detroit, and that she had been a student at Tuskegee Institute down inAlabama-an education major. She was in New York at one of the big hospitals' school of nursing.She lectured to the Muslim girls' and women's classes on hygiene and medical facts. 
我知道她是土生土长的底特律人，曾就读于阿拉巴马州的塔斯基吉学院，主修教育学。她在纽约一家大医院的护理学校给穆斯林女孩和妇女班讲授卫生和医学知识。
I ought to explain that each week night a different Muslim class, or event, is scheduled. Mondaynight, every temple's Fruit of Islam trains. People think this is just military drill, judo, karate, thingslike that-which _is_ part of the F.O.I. training, but only one part. The F.O.I. spends a lot more timein lectures and discussions on men learning to be men. They deal with the responsibilities of ahusband and father; what to expect of women; the rights of women which are not to be abrogatedby the husband; the importance of the father-male image in the strong household; current events;why honesty, and chastity, are vital in a person, a home, a community, a nation, and a civilization;why one should bathe at least once each twenty-four hours; business principles; and things ofthat nature. 
我应该解释一下，每个星期的晚上都有不同的穆斯林班级或活动安排。星期一晚上，每个清真寺的伊斯兰果实训练。人们认为这是军事演习、柔道、空手道之类的事情——这是伊斯兰果实训练的一部分，但只是其中的一部分。伊斯兰果实花费更多的时间在讲座和讨论上，让男性学习成为真正的男人。他们处理丈夫和父亲的责任；对女性的期望；女性的权利不应被丈夫剥夺；在强大的家庭中，父亲-男性形象的重要性；时事新闻；为什么诚实和贞操在一个人身上、一个家庭、一个社区、一个国家和一个文明中都是至关重要的；为什么一个人应该每天至少洗一次澡；商业原则；以及类似的事情。
Then, Tuesday night in every Muslim temple is Unity Night, where the brothers and sisters enjoyeach other's conversational company and refreshments, such as cookies and sweet and sour fruitpunches. Wednesday nights, at eight P. M., is what is called 
然后，每个穆斯林寺庙的星期二晚上都是团结之夜，兄弟姐妹们在那里享受彼此的交流和茶点，如饼干和甜酸水果宾治。星期三晚上8点是所谓的“祈祷之夜”，
Student Enrollment, where Islam's basic issues are discussed; it is about the equivalent ofcatechism class in the Catholic religion. 
学生注册，在那里讨论伊斯兰教的基本问题；相当于天主教的教义课。
Thursday nights there are the M.G.T. (Muslim Girls' Training) and the G.C.C. (General CivilizationClass), where the women and girls of Islam are taught how to keep homes, how to rear children,how to care for husbands, how tocook, sew, how to act at home and abroad, and other things thatare important to being a good Muslim sister and mother and wife. 
星期四晚上是MGT（穆斯林女孩训练）和GCC（一般文明班），在那里，伊斯兰教的女性和女孩被教导如何保持家庭，如何抚养孩子，如何照顾丈夫，如何烹饪、缝纫，如何在国内外行事，以及其他对于成为一个好穆斯林姐妹、母亲和妻子重要的事情。
Fridays are devoted to Civilization Night, when classes are held for brothers and sisters in thearea of the domestic relations, emphasizing how both husbands and wives must understand andrespect each other's true natures. Then Saturday night is for all Muslims a free night, when,usually, they visit at each other's homes. And, of course, on Sundays, every Muslim temple holdsits services. 
星期五是文明之夜，为该地区的兄弟姐妹们举办家庭关系方面的课程，强调丈夫和妻子必须相互理解和尊重对方的真实本性。然后星期六晚上是所有穆斯林的自由之夜，通常他们会互相拜访。当然，在星期天，每个穆斯林寺庙都会举行礼拜仪式。
On the Thursday M.G.T. and G.C.C. nights, sometimes I would drop in on the classes, andmaybe at Sister Betty X's classes-just as on other nights I might drop in on the different brothers'classes. At first I would just ask her things like how were the sisters learning-things like that, andshe would say "Fine, Brother Minister." I'd say, "Thank you, Sister." Like that. And that would beall there was to it. And after a while, I would have very short conversations with her, just to befriendly. 
在星期四的MGT和GCC晚上，有时我会顺便去参加这些课程，也许在贝蒂X姐妹的班上——就像在其他晚上我可能会顺便去参加不同的兄弟的课程一样。起初，我只是问她一些类似姐妹们学得如何之类的事情，她会说“好极了，牧师兄弟。”我会说：“谢谢你，姐妹。”像这样。这就是全部了。过了一段时间，我会和她进行非常简短的对话，只是为了友好。
One day I thought it would help the women's classes if I took her-j ust because she happened tobe an instructor, to the Museum of Natural History. I wanted to show her some Museum displayshaving to do with the tree of evolution, that would help her in her lectures. I could show her proofsof Mr. Muhammad's teachings of such things as that the filthy pig is only a large rodent. The pig isa graft between a rat, a cat and a dog, Mr. Muhammad taught us. When I mentioned my idea toSister Betty X, I made it very clear that it was just to help her lectures to the sisters. I had evenconvinced myself that this was the only reason. 
有一天，我想如果带她去自然历史博物馆，会有助于女性课程。因为碰巧她是讲师，我想给她看一些与进化树有关的博物馆展品，这将有助于她的讲座。我可以向她展示穆罕默德先生教授的关于肮脏的猪只是一只大型啮齿动物的证据。猪是老鼠、猫和狗之间的嫁接，穆罕默德先生教给我们。当我向贝蒂X姐妹提到我的想法时，我非常清楚地表明这只是为了帮助她在姐妹们面前讲课。我甚至说服了自己这是唯一的原因。
Then by the time of the afternoon I said we would go, well, I telephoned her; I told her I had tocancel the trip, that something important had come up. She said, "Well, you sure waited longenough to tell me, Brother Minister, I wasjust ready to walk out of the door." So I told her, well, allright, come on then, I'd make it somehow. But I wasn't going to have much time. 
然后到了下午，我说我们要去博物馆，好吧，我给她打电话；我告诉她我必须取消这次旅行，因为发生了一些重要的事情。她说：“哦，牧师兄弟，你等了这么久才告诉我，我已经准备好走出门口了。”所以我就告诉她，好吧，那来吧，我会想办法的。但我没有太多时间。
While we were down there, offhandedly I asked her all kinds of things. I just wanted some idea ofher thinking; you understand, I mean _how_ she thought. I was halfway impressed by herintelligence and also her education. In those days she was one of the few whom we had attractedwho had attended college. 
当我们在那里时，我随口问了她各种各样的事情。我只是想知道她的想法；你明白，我的意思是她如何思考。她的聪明才智和教育给我留下了深刻的印象。在那些日子里，她是少数被我们吸引到大学里的人之一。
Then, right after that, one of the older sisters confided to me a personal problem that Sister BettyX was having. I was really surprised that when she had had the chance, Sister Betty X had notmentioned anything to me about it. Every Muslim minister is always hearing the problems ofyoung people whose parents have ostracized them for becoming Muslims. Well, when SisterBetty X told her foster parents, who were financing her education, that she was a Muslim, theygave her a choice: leave the Muslims, or they'd cut off her nursing school. 
然后，就在这个时候，一个年长的姐妹向我吐露了贝蒂X姐妹正在面临的个人问题。我很惊讶，当她有机会时，贝蒂X姐妹没有向我提及任何关于它的事情。每个穆斯林牧师总是听到年轻人的问题，因为他们的父母因为他们成为穆斯林而排斥他们。那么，当贝蒂X告诉她资助她教育的养父母她是穆斯林时，他们给了她一个选择：离开穆斯林，否则他们会切断她的护理学校。
It was right near the end of her term-but she was hanging on to Islam. She began taking baby- sitting jobs for some of the doctors who lived on the grounds of the hospital where she wastraining. 
那是她任期的最后一段时间——但她坚持信仰伊斯兰教。她开始为一些住在医院里的医生做保姆工作，而她正在接受培训的地方就是这家医院。
In my position, I would never have made any move without thinking how it would affect the Nationof Islam organization as a whole. 
以我的地位，如果我在没有考虑它对伊斯兰国家组织整体的影响的情况下采取任何行动，那将是我永远不会做的事情。
I got to turning it over in my mind. What would happen if I just _should_ happen, sometime, tothink about getting married to somebody? For instance Sister Betty X-although it could be anysister in any temple, but Sister Betty X, for instance, would just happen to be the right height forsomebody my height, and also the right age. 
我开始在脑海中反复思考。如果我有朝一日真的考虑和某个人结婚，会发生什么事情呢？比如说贝蒂X姐妹——虽然这可能发生在任何寺庙的任何姐妹身上，但比如说，贝蒂X姐妹恰好适合我的身高，也正好适合我的年龄。
Mr. Elijah Muhammad taught us that a tall man married to a too-short woman, orvice-versa, theylooked odd, not matched. And he taught that a wife's ideal age was half the man's age, plusseven. He taught that women are physiologically ahead of men. Mr. Muhammad taught that nomarriage could succeed where the woman did not look up with respect to the man. And that theman had to have something above and beyond the wife in order for her to be able to look to himfor psychological security. 
伊利亚·穆罕默德先生教导我们，一个高个子男人和一个女人结婚，如果女人太矮，或者反过来，他们看起来很奇怪，不匹配。他还教导说，妻子的理想年龄是丈夫年龄的一半再加七岁。他教导说，从生理上讲，女性比男性更先进。穆罕默德先生教导说，在女性没有尊重男性的情况下，婚姻是不可能成功的。而男人必须拥有超越妻子的东西，以便她能够依靠他获得心理上的安全感。
I was so shocked at myself, when I realized _what_ I was thinking, I quit going anywhere nearSister Betty X, or any where I knew she would be. If she came into our restaurant and I wasthere, I went out somewhere. I was glad I knew that she had no idea what I had been thinkingabout. My not talking to her wouldn't give her any reason to think anything, since there had neverbeen one _personal_ word spoken between us-even if she had _thought_ anything. 
当我意识到自己在想什么时，我对自己感到非常震惊，于是我不再接近贝蒂X姐妹，或者我知道她会去的任何地方。如果她来到我们的餐厅，而我也在那里，我会出去到某个地方。我很高兴她知道我不知道她在想什么。我不和她说话不会让她有任何理由去想任何事情，因为我们之间从未有过任何私人的话语——即使她曾经想过什么。
I studied about if I just _should_ happen to say something to her-what would her position be?Because she wasn't going to get any chance to embarrass me. I had heard too many womenbragging, "I told that chump 'Get lost!'" I'd had too much experience of the kind to make a manvery cautious. 
我研究了如果我碰巧对她说了些什么，她的立场会是什么？因为她不会有机会让我难堪。我听过太多女人吹嘘：“我告诉那个傻瓜‘滚开！’”我对这种事情有太多的经验，让男人非常谨慎。
I knew one good thing; she had few relatives. My feeling about in-laws was that they wereoutlaws. Right among the Temple Seven Muslims, I had seen more marriages destroyed by in- laws, usually anti-Muslim, than any other single thing I knew of. 
我知道一件好事：她几乎没有亲戚。我对姻亲的感觉是他们是非法的。在寺庙里的七个穆斯林中，我见过更多的婚姻被姻亲破坏，通常是反穆斯林，比我所知道的任何其他事情都要多。
I wasn't about to say any of that romance stuff that Hollywood and television had filled women'sheads with. If I was going to do something, I was going to do it directly. And anything I was goingto do, I was going to do _my_ way. And because _I_ wanted to do it. Not because I sawsomebody do it. Or read about it in a book. Or saw it in a moving picture somewhere. 
我不想说任何浪漫的话，好莱坞和电视里充斥着这些东西。如果我要做点什么，我会直接去做。我要做的任何事情，都会按照我自己的方式去做。因为我想做，而不是因为别人这么做了。或者在书里读到过。或者在某个电影里看到过。
I told Mr. Muhammad, when I visited him in Chicago that month, that I wasthinking about a veryserious step. He smiled when he heard what it was. 
当月我拜访了在芝加哥的穆罕默德先生，告诉他我在考虑一个非常严肃的步骤。当他听到是什么时，他笑了。
I told him I was just thinking about it, that was all. Mr. Muhammad said that he'd like to meet thissister. 
我告诉他我只是在考虑，仅此而已。穆罕默德先生说他想见见这位姐妹。
The Nation by this time was financially able to bear the expenses so that instructor sisters fromdifferent temples could be sent to Chicago to attend the Headquarters Temple Two women'sclasses, and, while there, to meet The Honorable Elijah Muhammad in person. Sister Betty X, ofcourse, knew all about this, so there was no reason for her to think anything of it when it wasarranged for her to go to Chicago. And like all visiting instructor sisters, she was the house guestof the Messenger and Sister Clara Muhammad. 
此时，国家在经济上能够承担费用，因此来自不同寺庙的教导此时，国家在经济上能够承担费用，因此来自不同寺庙的教导姐妹可以被派往芝加哥参加总部寺庙的两个女性课程，并在那里亲自会见尊贵的伊利亚·穆罕默德。当然，贝蒂X姐妹知道这一切，所以当安排好她去芝加哥时，她没有任何理由去想任何事情。和所有来访的教导姐妹一样，她是信使和克拉拉·穆罕默德姐妹的客人。
Mr. Muhammad told me that he thought that Sister Betty X was a fine sister. 
穆罕默德先生告诉我，他认为贝蒂X姐妹是一位优秀的姐妹。
If you are thinking about doing a thing, you ought to make up your mind if you are going to do it,or not do it. One Sunday night, after the Temple Seven meeting, I drove my car out on the GardenState Parkway. I was on my way to visit my brother Wilfred, in Detroit. Wilfred, the year before, in1957, had been made the minister of Detroit's Temple One. I hadn't seen him, or any of my family,in a good while. 
如果你正在考虑做一件事情，你应该下定决心是否要去做，或者不做。一个星期天的晚上，在七个寺庙的会议结束后，我开着我的车去了花园州立公园路。我正前往底特律拜访我的兄弟威尔弗雷德。威尔弗雷德在1957年被选为底特律第一座寺庙的牧师。我已经很久没有见过他或我的家人了。
It was about ten in the morning when I got inside Detroit. Getting gas at a filling station, I just wentto their pay phone on a wall; I telephoned Sister Betty X. I had to get Information to get thenumber of the nurses' residence at this hospital. Most numbers I memorized, but I had alwaysmade it some point never to memorize her number. Somebody got her to the phone finally. Shesaid, "Oh, hello, Brother Minister-" I just said it to her direct: "Look, do you want to get married?" 
大约是早上十点左右，我到了底特律。在一个加油站加油时，我走到墙上的付费电话旁，给贝蒂X姐妹打了个电话。我必须得到医院护士宿舍的号码。大多数号码我都记下来了，但我从来没有记住过她的号码。最后有人把她叫到电话旁。她说：“哦，你好，牧师兄弟——”我只是直接对她说：“听着，你想结婚吗？”
Naturally, she acted all surprised and shocked.The more I have thought about it, to this day I believe she was only putting on an act. Becausewomen know. They know. 
当然，她表现得非常惊讶和震惊。我越想越觉得，直到今天我仍然相信她只是在演戏。因为女人知道。她们知道。
She said, just like I knew she would, "Yes." Then I said, well, I didn't have a whole lot of time,she'd better catch a plane to Detroit. 
她说，就像我知道她会说的那样：“是的。”然后我说，好吧，我没有太多时间了，她最好赶上去底特律的飞机。
So she grabbed a plane. I met her foster parents who lived in Detroit. They had made up by thistime. They were very friendly, and happily surprised. At least, they acted that way. 
于是她赶上了飞机。我见到了她在底特律的养父母。他们在这个时候已经和好了。他们非常友好，而且感到惊喜。至少，他们是这么表现的。
Then I introduced Sister Betty X at my oldest brother Wilfred's house. I had already asked himwhere people could get married without a whole lot of mess and waiting. He told me in Indiana. 
然后我在我最年长的兄弟威尔弗雷德的房子里介绍了贝蒂X姐妹。我已经问过他在哪里可以不用太麻烦和等待就可以结婚。他告诉我在印第安纳州。
Early the next morning, I picked up Betty at her parents' home. We drove to the first town inIndiana. We found out that only a few days before, the state law had been changed, and nowIndiana had a long waiting period. 
第二天早上，我在贝蒂父母的家中接了她。我们开车去了印第安纳州的第一个城镇。我们发现就在几天前，该州的法律已经改变，现在印第安纳州的等待时间很长。
This was the fourteenth of January, 1958; a Tuesday. We weren't far from Lansing, where mybrother Philbert lived. I drove there. Philbert was at work when we stopped at his house and Iintroduced Betty X. She and Philbert's wife were talking when I found out on the phone that wecould get married in one day, if we rushed. 
这是1958年1月14日，星期二。我们离我的兄弟菲尔伯特居住的兰辛不远。我开车去了那里。当我们停在他的房子时，菲尔伯特正在工作，我介绍了贝蒂X。当她和菲尔伯特的妻子交谈时，我在电话上发现如果我们匆忙的话，我们可以在一天内结婚。
We got the necessary blood tests, then the license. Where the certificate said "Religion," I wrote"Muslim." Then we went to the Justice of the Peace. 
我们做了必要的血液检查，然后拿到了执照。在证书上写着“宗教”的地方，我写了“穆斯林”。然后我们去了治安法官那里。
An old hunchbacked white man performed the wedding. And all of the witnesses were white.Where you are supposed to say all those "I do' s," we did. They were all standing there, smilingand watching every move. The old devilsaid, "I pronounce you man and wife," and then, "Kissyour bride." 
一个驼背的白人老头主持了婚礼。所有的证人都是白人。在那里，你应该说所有的“我愿意”，我们都说了。他们都站在那里，微笑着看着每一个动作。这个老魔鬼说：“我宣布你们成为夫妻”，然后说：“亲吻你的新娘。”
I got her out of there. All of that Hollywood stuff! Like these women wanting men to pick them upand carry them across thresholds and some of them weigh more than you do. I don't know howmany marriage breakups are caused by these movie-and television-addicted women expectingsome bouquets and kissing and hugging and being swept out like Cinderella for dinner anddancing-then getting mad when a poor, scraggly husband comes in tired and sweaty fromworking like a dog all day, looking for some food. 
我带她离开了那里。所有的好莱坞电影！就像这些女人希望男人把她们抱起来，穿过门槛，其中一些比你重。我不知道有多少婚姻破裂是因为这些沉迷于电影和电视的女人期望一些花束、亲吻、拥抱，像灰姑娘一样被赶出去吃晚餐和跳舞——然后当一个可怜的、衣衫褴褛的丈夫整天像狗一样工作，疲惫不堪、汗流浃背地回家寻找食物时，她会生气。
We had dinner there at Philbert's home in Lansing. "I've got a surprise for you," I told him whenwe came in. "You haven't got any surprise for me," he said. When he got home from work andheard I'd been there introducing a Muslim sister, he knew I was either married, or on the way toget married. 
我们在兰辛菲尔伯特的家里吃了晚饭。“我给你一个惊喜，”当我们进来时我告诉他。“你没有给我任何惊喜，”他说。当他下班回家听到我在那里介绍一个穆斯林姐妹时，他知道我已经结婚了，或者正在结婚的路上。
Betty's nursing school schedule called for her to fly right back to New York, and she could returnin four days. She claims she didn't tell anybody in Temple Seven that we had married. 
贝蒂的护理学校时间表要求她马上飞回纽约，她可以在四天后回来。她声称她没有告诉寺庙七号的任何一个人我们已经结婚了。
That Sunday, Mr. Muhammad was going to teach at Detroit's Temple One. I had an AssistantMinister in New York now; I telephoned him to take over for me. Saturday, Betty came back. TheMessenger, after his teaching on Sunday, made the announcement. Even in Michigan, mysteering clear of all sisters was so well known, they just couldn't believe it. 
那个星期天，穆罕默德先生要去底特律第一座寺庙教学。我现在在纽约有一个助理部长；我打电话给他代替我。星期六，贝蒂回来了。传道者在星期天的教学结束后宣布了这个消息。即使在密歇根州，我避开所有姐妹的事情也是众所周知的，他们简直不敢相信。
We drove right back to New York together. The news really shook everybody in Temple Seven.Some young brothers looked at me as though I had betrayed them. But everybody else wasgrinning like Cheshire cats. The sisters just about ate up Betty. I never will forget hearing oneexclaim, "You got him!" That's like I was telling you, the _nature_ of women. She'd _got_ me .That's part ofwhy I never have been able to shake it out of my mind that she knew something-allthe time. Maybe she did get me! 
我们一起开车回到纽约。这个消息真的震撼了寺庙七号里的每一个人。一些年轻的兄弟看着我，好像我背叛了他们一样。但其他人都像柴郡猫一样咧嘴笑着。姐妹们几乎把贝蒂吞噬了。我永远不会忘记听到有人大声喊道：“你得到了他！”就像我告诉你们的一样，女人的本质就是这样。她得到了我。这就是为什么我从来没有能够从我的脑海中摆脱出来，她一直知道一些事情的原因。也许她确实得到了我！
Anyway, we lived for the next two and a half years in Queens, sharing a house of two smallapartments with Brother John AH and his wife of that time. He's now the National Secretary inChicago. 
无论如何，我们在皇后区住了两年半，和约翰· AH弟兄和他当时的妻子共用一套有两个小公寓的房子。他现在是芝加哥的国家秘书。
Attallah, our oldest daughter, was born in November  1958. 
1958年11月，大女儿阿塔拉出生了。
She's named for Attilah the Hun (he sacked Rome). Shortly after Attallah came, we moved to ourpresent seven-room house in an all-black section of Queens, Long Island. 
她是以匈奴王阿提拉(他洗劫了罗马)命名的。在阿塔拉出生后不久，我们搬到了现在位于长岛皇后区一个黑人区的七居室房子里。
Another girl, Qubilah (named after Qubilah Khan) was born on Christmas Day of 1960. Then,yasah ("Ilyas" is Arabic for "Elijah") was born in July 1962. And in 1964 our fourth daughter,Amilah, arrived. 
1960年圣诞节那天，另一个女儿奎比拉(以奎比拉·汗为名)出生了。接着，亚萨(  Yasah  ，意思是耶利米[ Elijah ] )在1962年7月出生。1964年，我们的第四个女儿阿米拉出世了。
I guess by now I will say I love Betty. She's the only woman I ever even thought about loving. Andshe's one of the very few-four women-whom I have ever trusted. The thing is, Betty's a goodMuslim woman and wife. You see, Islam is the only religion that gives both husband and wife atrue understanding of what love is. The Western "love" concept, you take it apart, it really is lust.But love transcends just the physical. Love is disposition, behavior, attitude, thoughts, likes,dislikes-these things make a beautiful woman, a beautiful wife. This is the beauty that neverfades. You find in your Western civilization that when a man's wife's physical beauty fails, sheloses her attraction. But Islam teaches us to look into the woman, and teaches her to look into us. 
我想现在我会说我爱贝蒂。她是我唯一想过要爱的女人。她是我信任的极少数女人之一——四个女人——中的一位。问题是，贝蒂是一个好穆斯林女人和妻子。你看，伊斯兰教是唯一让丈夫和妻子真正理解什么是爱的宗教。西方的“爱”概念，如果你把它拆开来看，它实际上就是欲望。但是爱超越了肉体。爱是性情、行为、态度、思想、喜好、厌恶——这些东西构成了一个美丽的女人和一个美丽的妻子。这是永远不会消失的美丽。在西方文明中，你会发现当一个男人的妻子失去了身体上的美丽时，她就失去了吸引力。但是伊斯兰教教导我们要审视这个女人，并教导她审视我们。
Betty does this, so she understands me. I would even say I don't imagine many other womenmight put up with the way I am . Awakening this brainwashed black man and telling this arrogant,devilish white man the truth about himself, Betty understands, is a full-time job. If I have work todo when I am home, the little time I am at home, she lets me have the quiet I need to work in. I'mrarely at home more than half of any week; I have been away as much as five months. I never getmuch chance to take her anywhere, and I know she likes to be with her husband. She is used tomy calling her from airports anywhere from Boston to San Francisco, or Miami to Seattle, or, herelately, cabling her from Cairo, Accra, or the Holy City of Mecca. Once on the long-distancetelephone, Betty told me in beautiful phrasing the way she thinks. She said, "You are presentwhen you are away." 
贝蒂做到了这一点，所以她理解我。我甚至可以说，我不认为很多其他女人可能会容忍我的方式。唤醒这个被洗脑的黑人并告诉这个傲慢、邪恶的白人他自己的真实情况，是贝蒂全职的工作。如果我在家有工作要做，那么在我很少在家的时间里，她会让我拥有安静的工作空间。我很少有一周在家超过一半的时间；我曾经离开家五个月。我从来没有太多机会带她去任何地方，我知道她喜欢和丈夫在一起。她已经习惯了我从波士顿到旧金山或迈阿密到西雅图的机场给她打电话，或者最近从开罗、阿克拉或圣城麦加给她发电报。有一次在长途电话中，贝蒂用美丽的措辞告诉我她的想法。她说：“你不在身边时，你仍然存在。”
Later that year, after Betty and I were married, I exhausted myself trying to be everywhere atonce, trying to help the Nation to keep growing. Guest-teaching at the Temple in Boston, I ended,as always, "Who among you wish to _follow_ The Honorable Elijah Muhammad?" And then I saw,in utter astonishment, that among those who were standing was my sister-_Ella!_ We have asaying that those who are the hardest to convince make the best Muslims. And for Ella it hadtaken five years. 
那年晚些时候，贝蒂和我结婚后，我竭尽全力试图同时出现在所有地方，试图帮助这个民族继续成长。在波士顿的寺庙里担任客座教师时，我总是以“你们中谁愿意追随尊贵的伊莱贾·穆罕默德？”作为结束语。然后我看到，完全惊讶的是，那些站着的人中有我的妹妹——艾拉！我们有一个说法，最难被说服的人是最好的穆斯林。而艾拉花了五年时间才成为穆斯林。
I mentioned, you will remember, how in a big city, a sizable organization can remain practicallyunknown, unless something happens that brings it to the general public's attention. Well, certainlyno one in the Nation of Islam had any anticipation of the kind of thing that would happen inHarlem one night. 
我提到过，你们会记得，在大城市里，一个相当大的组织可以几乎不为人知，除非发生一些事情引起公众的注意。当然，伊斯兰教国家中没有人预料到一天晚上会发生在哈莱姆这样的事情。
Two white policemen, breaking up a street scuffle between some Negroes, ordered other Negropassers-by to "Move on!" Of these bystanders, two happened to be Muslim brother JohnsonHinton and another brother of Temple Seven. They didn't scatter and run the way the white copswanted. Brother Hinton was attacked with nightsticks. His scalp was split open, and a police carcame and he was taken to a nearby precinct. 
两个白人警察正在制止一些黑人在街上斗殴，他们命令路过的黑人"走开！" 。这些旁观者中，有两个恰好是穆斯林兄弟约翰逊·亨顿和第七寺庙的另一个兄弟。他们没有像白人警察希望的那样散开逃跑。亨顿兄弟遭到了警棍袭击。他的头皮裂开了，一辆警车来了，他被带到附近的警察局。
The second brother telephoned our restaurant. And with some telephone calls,in less than half anhour about fifty of Temple Seven's men of the Fruit of Islam were standing in ranks-formationoutside the police precinct house. 
第二个兄弟给我们的餐馆打了电话。通过一些电话，不到半个小时，第七寺庙的五十名伊斯兰果品组织成员就站在警察局外的队列中。
Other Negroes, curious, came running, and gathered in excitement behind the Muslims. Thepolice, coming to the station house front door, and looking out of the windows, couldn't believewhat they saw. I went in, as the minister of Temple Seven, and demanded to see our brother. Thepolice first said he wasn't there. Then they admitted he was, but said I couldn't see him. I said thatuntil he was seen, and we were sure he received proper medical attention, the Muslims wouldremain where they were. 
其他好奇的黑人跑了过来，兴奋地聚集在穆斯林的身后。警察来到警察局前门，从窗户往外看，不敢相信他们所看到的。作为第七寺庙的部长，我走了进去，要求见我们的兄弟。警察一开始说他不在那里。然后他们承认他在，但说我不能见他。我说，在他得到妥善治疗之前，穆斯林们会一直留在那里。
They were nervous and scared of the gathering crowd outside. When I saw our Brother Hinton, itwas all I could do to contain myself. He was only semi-conscious. Blood had bathed his head andface and shoulders. I hope I never again have to withstand seeing another case of sheer policebrutality like that. 
他们紧张，害怕聚集在外面的人群。当我看到我们的兄弟亨顿时，我能做的只有控制自己。他只有半意识状态。血液浸透了他的头部、脸和肩膀。我希望我再也不用忍受看到像那样的纯粹警察暴行的情况了。
I told the lieutenant in charge, "That man belongs in the hospital." They called an ambulance.When it came and Brother Hinton was taken to Harlem Hospital, we Muslims followed, in looseformations, for about fifteen blocks along Lenox Avenue, probably the busiest thoroughfare inHarlem. Negroes who never had seen anything like this were coming out of stores andrestaurants and bars and enlarging the crowd following us. 
我告诉负责的中尉，“那个人应该去医院。”他们叫了救护车。当它到达并将亨顿兄弟送往哈莱姆医院时，我们穆斯林以松散的形式沿着列克星敦大道大约十五个街区跟随，这可能是哈莱姆最繁忙的街道。从未见过这样的事情的黑人从商店、餐馆和酒吧出来，扩大了跟随我们的群众。
The crowd was big, and angry, behind the Muslims in front of Harlem Hospital. Harlem's blackpeople were long since sick and tired of police brutality. And they never had seen anyorganization of black men take a firm stand as we were. 
人群很大，在哈莱姆医院前面的穆斯林后面愤怒地聚集。哈莱姆的黑人早已对警察暴行感到恶心和厌倦。他们从来没有见过任何黑人组织像我们一样坚定立场。
A high police official came up to me, saying "Get those people out of there." I told him that ourbrothers were standing peacefully, disciplined perfectly, and harming no one. He told me thoseothers, behind them, weren't disciplined. Ipolitely told him those others were his problem. 
一位高级警官走到我面前，说：“把那些人带出去。”我告诉他，我们的兄弟们和平地站着，纪律完美，没有伤害任何人。他告诉我，在他们身后的那些人没有纪律。我礼貌地告诉他，那些其他人是他的问题。
When doctors assured us that Brother Hinton was receiving the best of care, I gave the order andthe Muslims slipped away. The other Negroes' mood was ugly, but they dispersed also, when weleft. We wouldn't learn until later that a steel plate would have to be put into Brother Hinton's skull.(After that operation, the Nation of Islam helped him to sue; a jury awarded him over $70, 000,the largest police brutality judgment that New York City has ever paid. ) 
当医生向我们保证亨顿兄弟得到了最好的护理时，我下令让穆斯林们悄悄离开。其他黑人的情绪很糟糕，但当我们离开时，他们也散开了。直到后来我们才知道，一块钢板必须放在亨顿兄弟的头骨上。（手术后，伊斯兰国家帮助他起诉；陪审团判给他超过7万美元，这是纽约市有史以来支付的最大一笔警察暴行赔偿金。）
For New York City's millions of readers of the downtown papers, it was, at that time, another oneof the periodic "Racial Unrest in Harlem" stories. It was not played up, because of what hadhappened. But the police department, to be sure, pulled out and carefully studied the files on theNation of Islam, and appraised us with new eyes. Most important, in Harlem, the world's mostheavily populated black ghetto, the _Amsterdam News_ made the whole story headline news,and for the first time the black man, woman, and child in the streets were discussing "thoseMuslims." 
对于纽约市数百万市中心报纸的读者来说，这是当时另一篇定期发表的“哈莱姆种族骚乱”故事。由于发生的事情，它没有被夸大。但是，警察局确实抽出并仔细研究了有关伊斯兰国家的文件，并用新的眼光评价了我们。最重要的是，在哈莱姆这个世界人口最密集的黑人贫民窟中，《阿姆斯特丹新闻》将整个故事作为头条新闻，街头的黑人男女和儿童首次讨论“那些穆斯林”。
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
第十四章
BLACK MUSLIMS 
黑色穆斯林
In the spring of nineteen fifty-nine-some months before Brother Johnson Hinton's case hadawakened the Harlem black ghetto to us-a Negro journalist, Louis Lomax, then living in New York,asked me one morning whether our Nation of Islam would cooperate in being filmed as atelevision documentary program for the Mike Wallace Show, which featured controversialsubjects. I told Lomax that, naturally, anything like that would have to be referred to TheHonorable Elijah Muhammad. And Lomax did fly to Chicago to consult Mr. Muhammad. Afterquestioning Lomax, then cautioning him against some thingshe did not desire, Mr. Muhammadgave his consent. 
在1959年春天，也就是约翰逊·亨顿弟兄的案件唤醒哈莱姆黑人贫民窟的几个月前，一位名叫路易斯·洛马克斯的黑人记者在纽约问我，我们的伊斯兰国家是否会合作拍摄一部电视记录片，作为迈克·华莱士节目的一部分。我告诉洛马克斯，当然，任何类似的事情都必须提交给尊贵的伊利亚·穆罕默德先生。洛马克斯确实飞往芝加哥向穆罕默德先生咨询。在询问洛马克斯之后，穆罕默德先生警告他不要做一些他不想要的事情，然后同意了他的请求。
Cameramen began filming Nation of Islam scenes around our mosques in New York, Chicago,and Washington, D. C. Sound recordings were made of Mr. Muhammad and some ministers,including me, teaching black audiences the truths about the brainwashed black man and the devilwhite man. 
摄影师开始在纽约、芝加哥和华盛顿特区的清真寺周围拍摄伊斯兰国家场景。穆罕默德先生和一些部长，包括我在内，教黑人观众关于被洗脑的黑人和白人魔鬼的真实情况。
At Boston University around the same time, C. Eric Lincoln, a Negro scholar then working for hisdoctorate, had selected for his thesis subject the Nation of Islam. Lincoln's interest had beenaroused the previous year when, teaching at Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia, he received fromone of his Religion students a term paper whose introduction I can now quote from Lincoln'sbook. It was the plainspoken convictions of one of Atlanta's numerous young black collegians whooften visited our local Temple Fifteen. 
大约在同一时间，波士顿大学的黑人学者C.埃里克·林肯正在攻读博士学位，他选择伊斯兰国家作为他的论文主题。林肯的兴趣是前一年在佐治亚州亚特兰大市的克拉克学院任教时被激发起来的，他从他的一名宗教学生那里收到了一篇论文，我现在可以引用林肯书中的引言。这是一位经常参观我们当地的十五座寺庙的年轻黑人大学生的坦率信念之一。
"The Christian religion is incompatible with the Negro's aspirations for dignity and equality inAmerica," the student had written. "It has hindered where it might have helped; it has beenevasive when it was morally bound to be forthright; it has separated believers on the basis ofcolor, although it has declared its mission to be a universal brotherhood under Jesus Christ.Christian love is the white man's love for himself and for his race. For the man who is not white,Islam is the hope for justice and equality in the world we must build tomorrow." 
这位学生写道：“基督教与黑人在美国追求尊严和平等的愿望不相容。它在可能有帮助的地方阻碍了我们；在道德上应该坦诚的时候，它却回避了问题；它根据肤色将信徒分开，尽管它宣称自己的使命是在耶稣基督下建立一个普遍的兄弟关系。基督教的爱是白人对自己的爱和对自己种族的爱。对于那些不是白人的人来说，伊斯兰教是我们明天必须建立的世界中正义和平等的希望。”
After some preliminary research showed Professor Lincoln what a subject he had hold of, he hadbeen able to obtain several grants, and a publisher's encouragement to expand his thesis into abook. 
经过一些初步的研究，林肯教授发现他掌握了一个多么重要的课题。他得到了几笔补助金，并且有一家出版商鼓励他将论文扩展成一本书。
On the wire of our relatively small Nation, these two big developments-a television show, and abook about us-naturally were big news. Every Muslim happily anticipated that now, through thewhite man's powerful communicationsmedia, our brainwashed black brothers and sisters acrossthe United States, and devils, too, were going to see, hear, and read Mr. Muhammad's teachingswhich cut back and forth like a two-edged sword. 
在我们这个相对较小的伊斯兰国家里，这两个重大的发展— —一个电视节目和一本关于我们的书— —自然成了重大新闻。每个穆斯林都高兴地期待着，现在通过白人强大的传播媒体，我们在美国被洗脑的黑人兄弟姐妹们，以及魔鬼们，都将看到、听到和读到穆罕默德先生的教诲，这些教诲像一把双刃剑一样来回挥舞。
We had made our own very limited efforts to employ the power of print. First, some time back, Ihad made an appointment to see editor James Hicks of the _Amsterdam News_, published inHarlem. Editor Hicks said he felt every voice in the community deserved to be heard. Soon, eachweek's _Amsterdam News_ carried a little column that I wrote. Then, Mr. Muhammad agreed towrite a column for that valuable _Amsterdam News_ space, and my column was transferred toanother black newspaper, the Los Angeles _Herald Dispatch_. 
我们曾经非常有限地尝试过利用印刷媒体的力量。首先，一段时间以前，我约见了哈莱姆出版的《阿姆斯特丹新闻》的编辑詹姆斯·希克斯。希克斯编辑说，他认为社区中的每个声音都应该被听到。很快，每周的《阿姆斯特丹新闻》都刊登了我写的一个小专栏。然后，穆罕默德先生同意为这份有价值的《阿姆斯特丹新闻》撰写一个专栏，而我的专栏则转移到了另一家黑人报纸《洛杉矶先驱报》。
But I kept wanting to start, somehow, our own newspaper, that would be filled with Nation of Islamnews. 
但我一直在想，如何创办我们自己报纸，里面充满了伊斯兰国家的消息。
Mr. Muhammad in 1957 sent me to organize a Temple in Los Angeles. When I had done that,being in that city where the _Herald Dispatch_ was, I went visiting and I worked in their office;they let me observe how a newspaper was put together. I've always been blessed in that if I canonce watch something being done, generally I can catch onto how to do it myself. Quick "pickingup" was probably the number one survival rule when I'd been out there in the streets as a hustler. 
1957年，穆罕默德先生派我去洛杉矶组织一座清真寺。当我完成这项工作后，我去了《先驱报》所在的城市，并在那里的办公室里工作；他们让我观察一份报纸是如何组合在一起的。我一直很幸运，因为如果我能一次看到某件事情被完成，通常我就能学会如何自己去做。快速“掌握”可能是我在街上当骗子时的首要生存法则。
Back in New York, I bought a secondhand camera. I don't know how many rolls of film I shot untilI could take usable pictures. Every chance I had, I wrote some little news about interesting Nationof Islam happenings. One day every month, I'd lock up in a room and assemble my material andpictures for a printer that I found. I named the newspaper _Muhammad Speaks_ and Muslimbrothers sold it on the ghetto sidewalks. Little did I dream that later on, when jealo usy set inamong the hierarchy, nothing about me would be printed in the paper I had founded.Anyway, national publicity was in the offing for the Nation of Islam when Mr. Muhammad sent meon a three-week trip to Africa. Even as small as we then were, some of the African and Asianpersonages had sent Mr. Muhammad private word that they liked his efforts to awaken and lift upthe American black people. Sometimes, the messages had been sent through me. As Mr.Muhammad's emissary, I went to Egypt, Arabia, to the Sudan, to Nigeria, and Ghana. 
回到纽约后，我买了一台二手相机。我不知道拍了多少卷胶卷，直到我能拍出可用的照片。每当有机会，我就写一些关于伊斯兰国家发生的有趣事件的新闻。每个月的某一天，我会锁在房间里整理我的材料和照片，然后交给我找到的一家印刷厂。我把这份报纸命名为《穆罕默德之声》，穆斯林兄弟们在贫民窟的人行道上出售它。我做梦也没想到，后来当嫉妒心理在领导层中产生时，我在自己创办的报纸上什么也不会被刊登了。无论如何，当穆罕默德先生派我去非洲进行为期三周的旅行时，伊斯兰国家的全国宣传即将到来。即使我们当时很小，一些非洲和亚洲政要已经私下里向穆罕默德先生表示，他们喜欢他唤醒和提升美国黑人的努力。有时，这些信息是通过我传递的。作为穆罕默德先生的使者，我去了埃及、阿拉伯、苏丹、尼日利亚和加纳。
You will often hear today a lot of the Negro leaders complaining that what thrust the Muslims intointernational prominence was the white man's press, radio, television, and other media. I have noshred of argument with that. They are absolutely correct. Why, none of us in the Nation of Islamremotely anticipated what was about to happen. 
今天，你经常听到许多黑人领袖抱怨说，是白人的报纸、电台、电视和其他媒体把穆斯林推上了国际舞台。我对此毫无异议。他们完全正确。为什么，我们在伊斯兰国家中没有人能预见到即将发生的事情。
*     *     * 
In late 1959, the television program was aired. "The Hate That Hate Produced"-the title-wasedited tightly into a kaleidoscope of "shocker" images . . . Mr. Muhammad, me, and othersspeaking . . . strong-looking, set-faced black men, our Fruit of Islam . . . white-scarved, white- gowned Muslim sisters of all ages. . . Muslims in our restaurants, and other businesses . . .Muslims and other black people entering and leaving our mosques . . . . 
1959年底，这个电视节目播出了。“仇恨所产生的仇恨” - 标题被编辑成一个“震惊”的图像万花筒...穆罕默德先生，我和其他人在讲话...看起来很强壮，面容坚定的黑人们，我们的伊斯兰果组织成员...戴着白头巾、穿着白袍的穆斯林姐妹们，无论年龄大小...在我们的餐馆和其他企业中的穆斯林们...进入和离开我们清真寺的穆斯林和其他黑人人们...
Every phrase was edited to increase the shock mood. As the producers intended, I think peoplesat just a bout limp when the program went off. 
每个片段都被编辑过，以增加震撼的效果。正如制片人所期望的那样，我想当节目结束时，人们只是感到软弱无力。
In a way, the public reaction was like what happened back in the 1930's when Orson Wellesfrightened America with a radio program describing, as though it was actually happening, aninvasion by "men from Mars." 
从某种意义上说，公众的反应就像1930年代奥森·威尔斯用广播节目吓唬美国一样，描述了一场“火星人”入侵，仿佛真的发生了。
No one now jum ped from any windows, but in New York City there was aninstant avalanche ofpublic reaction. It's my personal opinion that the "Hate . . . Hate . . ." title was primarilyresponsible for the reaction. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, black and white, wereexclaiming "Did you hear it? Did you see it? Preaching _hate_ of white people!" 
现在没有人从任何窗户跳下来，但在纽约市立即爆发了公众的反应。我个人认为这是“仇恨……仇恨……”的标题主要负责反应。成千上万的纽约人，黑人和白人，都在惊呼：“你听到了吗？你看到了吗？宣扬对白人的仇恨！”
Here was one of the white man's most characteristic behavior patterns-where black men areconcerned. He loves himself so much that he is startled if he discovers that his victims don't sharehis vainglorious self-opinion. In America for centuries it had been just f ine as long as thevictimized, brutalized and exploited black people had been grinning and begging and "Yessa,Massa" and Uncle Tomming. But now, things were different. First came the white newspapers- feature writers and columnists: "Alarming" . . ."hate-messengers" . . ."threat to the good relationsbetween the races" . . ."black segregationists" . . ."black supremacists," and the like. 
这是白人在涉及黑人时最典型的行为模式之一。他非常爱自己，以至于如果他发现他的受害者不赞同他那自大的自以为是的观点时，他会大吃一惊。在美国几个世纪以来，只要受到迫害、被残酷对待和剥削的黑人一直微笑着、乞求着、说着“是的，主人”和汤姆叔叔那样的话，那么一切都很好。但现在情况不同了。首先是白人报纸的特色作家和专栏作家：“令人震惊的”“仇恨使者”“种族间良好关系的威胁”“黑人分离主义者”“黑人至上主义者”等等。
And the newspapers' ink wasn't dry before the big national weekly news magazines started:"Hate-teachers" . . ."violence-seekers" . . ."black racists" . . ."black fascists" . . ."anti-Christian" . . ."possibly Communist-inspired . . . ." 
在大型全国性新闻周刊开始之前，报纸的墨迹未干：“仇恨教师”.“暴力追求者”.“黑人种族主义者”.“黑人法西斯主义者”.“反基督教”.“可能受共产主义启发.”
It rolled out of the presses of the biggest devil in the history of mankind. And then the arousedwhite man made his next move. 
它从人类历史上最大的魔鬼的印刷机中滚出来。然后被激怒的白人做出了他的下一步行动。
Since slavery, the American white man has always kept some handpicked Negroes who faredmuch better than the black masses suffering and slaving out in the hot fields. The white man hadthese "house" and "yard" Negroes for his special servants. He threw them more crumbs from hisrich table, he even let them eat in his kitchen. He knew that he could always count on them tokeep "good massa" happy in his self-image of being so "good" and "righteous." "Good massa"always heard just what he wanted to hear from these "house" and "yard" blacks. "You're such agood, _fine_ massa!" Or, "Oh, massa, those old black nigger fieldhands out there, they're happyjust like they are; why, massa, they'renot intelligent enough for you to try and do any better forthem, massa-" 
自奴隶制以来，美国白人一直保留着一些精心挑选的黑人，他们比在炎热的田野里受苦受难、做苦工的黑人群要好得多。白人把这些“家”和“院子”里的黑人当作他的特别仆人。他从他富裕的餐桌上扔给他们更多的面包屑，他甚至让他们在他的厨房里吃饭。他知道他总是可以依靠他们来让“好主人”在他的自我形象中保持快乐，因为他是如此“善良”和“正义”。 “好主人”总是听到这些“家”和“院子”里的黑人想听的话。 “你真是一个好人，好主人！”或者，“哦，主人，那些老黑奴们在外面干活，他们就像现在这样快乐；为什么，主人，他们不够聪明，你不能为他们做得更好，主人——”
Well, slavery time's "house" and "yard" Negroes had become more sophisticated, that was all.When now the white man picked up his telephone and dialed his "house" and "yard" Negroes- why, he didn't even need to instruct the trained black puppets. They had seen the televisionprogram; had read the newspapers. They were already composing their lines. They knew what todo. 
嗯，奴隶时代的“家”和“院子”里的黑人变得更加老练了，仅此而已。现在当白人拿起电话拨通他的“家”和“院子”里的黑人时——哦，他甚至不需要指示那些受过训练的黑人傀儡。他们已经看到了电视节目；已经阅读了报纸。他们已经在编写他们的台词了。他们知道该怎么做。
I'm not going to call any names. But if you make a list of the biggest Negro "leaders," so-called, in1960, then you've named the ones who began to attack us "field" Negroes who were sounding_insane_, talking that way about "good massa." 
我不会点名。但是如果你列出1960年最大的黑人“领袖”名单，那么你就会我不会点名。但是如果你列出1960年最大的黑人“领袖”名单，那么你就会列出那些开始攻击我们这些在田野里工作的“疯狂的”黑奴的人，他们谈论“好主人”的方式很疯狂。
"By no means do these Muslims represent the Negro masses-" That was the first worry, toreassure "good massa" that he had no reason to be concerned about his fieldhands in theghettoes. "An irresponsible hate cult" . . ."an unfortunate Negro image, just when the racial pictureis improving-" 
“这些穆斯林绝不代表黑人群众——”这是第一个担忧，为了让“好主人”放心，他不必担心他在贫民窟里的黑奴。 “一种不负责任的仇恨崇拜” . . .“一种不幸的黑人形象，就在种族关系正在改善的时候——”
They were stumbling over each other to get quoted. "A deplorable reverse-racism" . . ."Ridiculouspretenders to the ancient Islamic doctrine" . . ."Heretic anti-Christianity-' 
他们争相引用我的话。“可悲的逆向种族主义” . . .“可笑的古伊斯兰教义的冒充者” . . .“异端的反基督教”——
The telephone in our then small Temple Seven restaurant nearly jumped off the wall. I had areceiver against my ear five hours a day. I was listening, and jotting in my notebook, as press,radio, and television people called, all of them wanting the Muslim reaction to the quoted attacksof these black "leaders." Or I was on long-distance to Mr. Muhammad in Chicago, reading frommy notebook and asking for Mr. Muhammad's instructions. 
当时我们小小的第七神庙餐厅的电话几乎要从墙上掉下来了。我每天有五个小时把听筒贴在耳朵上。我一边听着，一边在我的笔记本上做笔记，因为新闻、广播和电视界的人都打电话来，他们都想知道穆斯林对这些黑人“领袖”的攻击做出的反应。或者我会给芝加哥的穆罕默德先生打长途电话，从我的笔记本里读出一些东西，然后询问穆罕默德先生的指导。
I couldn't understand how Mr. Muhammad could maintain his calm and patience, hearing thethings I told him. I could scarcely contain myself.My unlisted home telephone number somehow got out. My wife Betty put down the phone aftertaking one message, and it was ringing again. It seemed that wherever I went, telephones wereringing. 
我无法理解穆罕默德先生怎么能保持冷静和耐心，听到我告诉他的事情。我几乎控制不住自己。我的未列入电话簿的家庭电话号码不知怎么泄露出去了。我的妻子贝蒂接了一个电话后放下了电话，然后又响了起来。似乎无论我走到哪里，电话都在响。
The calls naturally were directed to me, New York City being the major news- media headquarters,and I was the New York minister of Mr. Muhammad. Calls came, long-distance from SanFrancisco to Maine . . . from even London, Stockholm, Paris. I would see a Muslim brother at ourrestaurant, or Betty at home, trying to keep cool; they'd hand me the receiver, and I couldn'tbelieve it, either. One funny thing-in all that hectic period, something quickly struck my notice: theEuropeans never pressed the "hate" question. Only the American white man was so plagued andobsessed with being "hated." He was so guilty, it was clear to me, of hating Negroes. 
这些电话自然而然地都打给了我，纽约市是主要的新闻媒体总部，而我是穆罕默德先生在纽约的部长。来自旧金山到缅因州的电话……甚至来自伦敦、斯德哥尔摩、巴黎的电话。我会在我们的餐厅看到一位穆斯林兄弟，或者在家里看到贝蒂，试图保持冷静；他们会把听筒递给我，而我也无法相信。有一件有趣的事情——在那段繁忙的时间里，有一件事情很快引起了我的注意：欧洲人从不追问“仇恨”问题。只有美国白人被这种“仇恨”所困扰和困扰。他如此内疚，对我来说很明显，他恨黑人。
"Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy, and hate?" A red flag waved for me,something chemical happened inside me, every time I heard that. When we Muslims had talkedabout "the devil white man" he had been relatively abstract, someone we Muslims rarely actuallycame into contact with, but now here was that devil-in-the-flesh on the phone-with all of hiscalculating, cold-eyed, self-righteous tricks and nerve and gall. The voices questioning mebecame to me as breathing, living devils. 
“马尔科姆X先生，为什么你要教导黑人至上主义和仇恨？”每当我听到这个问题时，就像一面红旗在我面前挥舞着，我内心发生了一些化学变化。当我们穆斯林谈论“魔鬼白人”时，他相对抽象，是穆斯林很少真正接触到的人，但现在这个活生生的魔鬼在电话里——带着他所有的计算、冷漠、自以为是的伎俩和神经和胆量。质疑我的声音对我来说就像是呼吸、活着的恶魔。
And I tried to pour on pure fire in return. "The white man so guilty of white supremacy can't hide_his_ guilt by trying to accuse The Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy andhate! All Mr. Muhammad is doing is trying to uplift the black man's mentality and the black man'ssocial and economic condition in this country. 
我试图用纯火来回报。“白人至上主义的白人如此有罪，无法通过试图指责尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德教导黑人至上主义和仇恨来掩盖他的罪行！穆罕默德先生所做的一切只是试图提高这个国家黑人的心态和社会经济状况。”
"The guilty, two-faced white man can't decide what he wants. Our slave foreparents would havebeen put to death for advocating so-called 'integration'with the white man. Now when Mr.Muhammad speaks of 'separation,' the white man calls us 'hate-teachers' and 'fascists'! 
“有罪的两面派白人无法决定他想要什么。我们的奴隶祖先会因为提倡与白人所谓的'融合'而被处以死刑。现在当穆罕默德先生谈到'分离'时，白人称我们为'仇恨教师'和'法西斯分子'！"
"The white man doesn't _want_ the blacks! He doesn't _want_ the blacks that are a parasite uponhim! He doesn't _want_ this black man whose presence and condition in this country expose thewhite man to the world for what he is! So why do you attack Mr. Muhammad?" 
“白人不想要黑人！他不想要那些对他有害的黑人！他不希望这个国家存在这个黑人，因为他的存在和状况让白人在世界上暴露了他的本性！那么你为什么攻击穆罕默德先生呢？”
I'd have _scathing_ in my voice; I _felt_ it. 
我的声音中带着尖刻，我感到了。
"For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the _raped_,or the wolf asking the _sheep_, 'Do you hate me?' The white man is in no moral _position_ toaccuse anyone else of hate! 
“白人问黑人是否恨他，就像强奸犯问被强奸者或狼问羊一样，'你恨我吗？'白人在道德上没有资格指责任何人恨！"
"Why, when all of my ancestors are snake-bitten, and I'm snake-bitten, and I warn my children toavoid snakes, what does that snake sound like accusing _me_ of hate-teaching?" 
“为什么，当我所有的祖先都被蛇咬过，我也被蛇咬过，我警告我的孩子要避开蛇，那条蛇听起来指责我仇恨教育的声音是什么样的？”
"Mr. Malcolm X," those devils would ask, "why is your Fruit of Islam being trained in judo andkarate?" An image of black men learning anything suggesting self-defense seemed to terrify thewhite man. I'd turn their question around: "Why does judo or karate suddenly get so ominousbecause black men study it? Across America, the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, even the YWCA, theCYP, PAL-they _all_ teach judo! It's all right, it's 
“马尔科姆X先生，”那些魔鬼会问，“为什么你的伊斯兰果实正在接受柔道和空手道的训练？”黑人学习任何暗示自卫的东西似乎都会让白人感到恐惧。我会反过来问他们：“为什么当黑人学习柔道或空手道时，它们突然变得如此不祥？在美国各地，童子军、基督教青年会、甚至女青年会、CYP、PAL——他们都教柔道！这没关系，这是……”
fine-until _black men_ teach it! Even little grammar school classes, little girls, are taught to defendthemselves-" 
“很好——直到黑人教它！即使是小学班级，小女孩也被教导要自卫——"
"How many of you are in your organization, Mr. Malcolm X? Right Reverend Bishop T.Chickenwing says you have only a handful of members-" 
“你们组织里有多少人，马尔科姆X先生？尊贵的T.Chickenwing主教说你们只有少数成员——”
 "Whoever tells you how many Muslims there are doesn't know, and whoever does know willnever tell you-" 
“无论谁告诉你有多少穆斯林，他都不知道，而知道的人永远不会告诉你——”
The Bishop Chickenwings were also often quoted about our "anti-Christianity." I'd fire right backon that: 
Chickenwing主教还经常被引用来指责我们的“反基督教”。我会立刻反击：
"Christianity is the white man's religion. The Holy Bible in the white man's hands and hisinterpretations of it have been the greatest single ideological weapon for enslaving millions ofnon-white human beings. Every country the white man has conquered with his guns, he hasalways paved the way, and salved his conscience, by carrying the Bible and interpreting it to callthe people 'heathens' and 'pagans'; then he sends his guns, then his missionaries behind theguns to mop up-" 
“基督教是白人的宗教。白人手中的《圣经》和他们的解释一直是奴役数百万非白人人类的最大单一意识形态武器。白人用枪征服的每一个国家，他总是铺平道路，用携带《圣经》并解释它来称呼人们为'异教徒'和'异教徒'来安慰自己的良心；然后他派出他的枪支，然后在枪支后面派出他的传教士来扫荡——”
White reporters, anger in their voices, would call us "demagogues," and I would try to be readyafter I had been asked the same question two or three times. 
白人记者，愤怒的声音，会称我们为“煽动者”，我会在被问了两三次同样的问题后试图做好准备。
"Well, let's go back to the Greek, and maybe you will learn the first thing you need to know aboutthe word 'demagogue.' 'Demagogue' means, actually, 'teacher of the people.' And let's examinesome demagogues. The greatest of all Greeks, Socrates, was killed as a 'demagogue.' JesusChrist died on the cross because the Pharisees of His day were upholding their law, not the spirit.The modern Pharisees are trying to heap destruction upon Mr. Muhammad, calling him ademagogue, a crackpot, and fanatic. What about Gandhi? The man that Churchill called 'a nakedlittle fakir,' refusing food in a British jail? But then a quarter of a billion people, a wholesubcontinent, rallied behind Gandhi-and they twisted the British lion's tail! What about Galileo,standing before his inquisitors, saying 'The earth _does_ move!' What about Martin Luther, nailingon a door his thesis against the all-powerful Catholic church which called him 'heretic'? We, thefollowers of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, are today inthe ghettoes as once the sect ofChristianity's followers were like termites in the catacombs and the grottoes-and they werepreparing the grave of the mighty Roman Empire!" 
好的，让我们回到希腊，也许你会学到关于“煽动者”这个词你需要知道的第一个事情。实际上，“煽动者”意味着“人民的教师”。让我们来审视一些煽动者。最伟大的希腊人苏格拉底，被作为“煽动者”杀死。耶稣基督死在十字架上，因为他那个时代的法利赛人坚持他们的法律，而不是精神。现代的法利赛人试图将毁灭加在穆罕默德先生身上，称他为煽动者、疯子和狂热分子。那么甘地呢？那个丘吉尔称之为“赤身裸体的穷苦僧人”，拒绝在英国监狱里进食的人呢？但是后来有2.5亿人，整个次大陆，团结在甘地身后——他们扭转了英国狮子的尾巴！伽利略站在审判官面前说“地球确实在运动！”又怎么样呢？马丁·路德把他反对全能的天主教会的论文钉在门上，教会称他为异端，又怎么样呢？我们，尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德的追随者们，今天在贫民窟中，就像基督教徒曾经在地下墓穴和洞穴中一样——他们正在准备强大的罗马帝国的坟墓！
I can remember those hot telephone sessions with those reporters as if it were yesterday. Thereporters were angry. I was angry. When I'd reach into history, they'd try to pull me back to thepresent. They would quit interviewing, quit their work, trying to defend their personal white devilselves. They would unearth Lincoln and his freeing of the slaves. I'd tell them things Lincoln saidin speeches, _against_ the blacks. They would drag up the 1954 Supreme Court decision onschool integration. 
我仍然记得那些与记者们激烈的电话交谈，就像昨天一样。记者们很生气。我也很生气。当我谈到历史时，他们试图把我拉回到现在。他们会停止采访，停止工作，试图捍卫他们的个人白人魔鬼自我。他们会挖掘林肯和他的解放奴隶。我会告诉他们林肯在演讲中说过的话，反对黑人。他们会提起1954年最高法院关于学校融合的决定。
"That was one of the greatest magical feats ever performed in America," I'd tell them. "Do youmean to tell me that nine Supreme Court judges, who are past masters of legal phraseology,couldn't have worked their decision to make it stick as _law_? No! It was trickery and magic thattold Negroes they were desegregated-Hooray! Hooray!-and at the same time it told whites 'Hereare your loopholes.'" 
“那是美国有史以来最伟大的魔法壮举之一，”我会告诉他们。“你的意思是告诉我，那九位最高法院法官，他们是法律术语的大师，不能把他们的决定作为法律来执行吗？不！这是诡计和魔法告诉黑人他们被废除了种族隔离——万岁！万岁！——同时它告诉白人‘这里是你们的漏洞。’”
The reporters would try their utmost to raise some "good" white man whom I couldn't refute assuch. I'll never forget how one practically lost his voice. He asked me did I feel _any_ white menhad ever done anything for the black man in America. I told him, "Yes, I can think of two. Hitler,and Stalin. The black man in America couldn't get a decent factory job u ntil Hitler put so muchpressure on the white man. And men Stalin kept up the pressure-' 
记者们会尽力提出一些“好”的白人，我无法反驳他们。我永远不会忘记一个人几乎失去了声音。他问我是否认为任何白人曾经为美国的黑人做过任何事情。我告诉他：“是的，我能想到两个。希特勒和斯大林。在美国的黑人直到希特勒对白人施加了如此大的压力之前才能得到一份体面的工厂工作。而斯大林一直保持着这种压力——'
But I don't care what points I made in the interviews, it practically never got printed the way I saidit. I was learning under fire how the press, when it wants to, can twist, and slant. If I had said"Mary had a little lamb," what probably would have appeared was "Malcolm X Lampoons Mary." 
但我不在乎我在采访中说了什么，实际上从来没有按照我说的方式被印刷出来。我在火线上学习新闻如何扭曲和倾斜。如果我说过“玛丽有一只小羊羔”，那么可能会出现的是“马尔科姆X嘲笑玛丽”。
 Even so, my bitterness was less against the white press than it was against those Negro"leaders" who kept attacking us. Mr. Muhammad said he wanted us to try our best not to publiclycounterattack the black "leaders" because one of the white man's tricks was keeping the blackrace divided and fighting against each other. Mr. Muhammad said that this had traditionally keptthe black people from achieving the unity which was the worst need of the black race in America. 
即便如此，我的愤怒与其说是针对白人媒体，不如说是针对那些不断攻击我们的黑人“领袖”。穆罕默德先生说，他希望我们尽量不要公开反击黑人“领袖”，因为白人的一个伎俩就是让黑人种族分裂并相互对抗。穆罕默德先生说，这传统上一直阻碍着黑人实现团结，而团结是黑人在美国最迫切需要的。
But instead of abating, the black puppets continued ripping and tearing at Mr. Muhammad and theNation of Islam-until it began to appear as though we were afraid to speak out against these"important" Negroes. That's when Mr. Muhammad's patience wore thin. And with his nod, I beganreturning their fire. 
但是，这些黑人傀儡并没有停止攻击，他们继续撕裂和抨击穆罕默德先生和伊斯兰国家——直到我们似乎害怕公开反对这些“重要”的黑人为止。这时，穆罕默德先生的耐心消磨殆尽了。在他的点头示意下，我开始回击他们的攻击。
"Today's Uncle Tom doesn't wear a handkerchief on his head. This modern, twentieth-centuryUncle Thomas now often wears a top hat. He's usually well-dressed and well-educated. He'soften the personification of culture and refinement. The twentieth-century Uncle Thomassometimes speaks With a Yale or Harvard accent. Sometimes he is known as Professor, Doctor,Judge, and Reverend, even Right Reverend Doctor. This twentieth-century Uncle Thomas is a_professional_ Negro . . . by that I mean his profession is being a Negro for the white man." 
“今天的汤姆叔叔不再戴头巾了。这个现代的、20世纪的汤姆叔叔现在经常戴着一顶高顶帽。他通常穿着得体，受过良好的教育。他是文化和修养的象征。20世纪的汤姆叔叔有时会带着耶鲁或哈佛口音说话。有时他被称为教授、博士、法官和牧师，甚至是最尊贵的牧师博士。这个20世纪的汤姆叔叔是一个专业的黑人……我的意思是他的职业是为白人当黑人。”
Never before in America had these hand-picked so-called "leaders" been publicly blasted in thisway. They reacted to the truth about themselves even more hotly than the devilish white man.Now their "institutional" indictments of us began. Instead of "leaders" speaking as themselves, forthemselves, now their weighty name organizations attacked Mr. Muhammad. 
在美国，这些精心挑选的所谓“领袖”们以前从未以这种方式被公开抨击过。他们对关于自己的真相的反应甚至比邪恶的白人还要激烈。现在他们开始对我们进行“体制性”的起诉。现在，他们的权威组织攻击穆罕默德先生，而不是像他们自己一样说话。
"Black bodies with white heads!" I called them what they were. Every one of those "Negroprogress" organizations had the same composition. Black "leaders"were out in the public eye-tobe seen by the Negroes for whom they were supposed to be fighting the white man. Butobscurely, behind the scenes, was a white boss-a president, or board chairman, or some othertitle, pulling the real strings. 
“黑人身体，白人头脑！”我称他们为所是。每个“黑人进步”组织都有相同的构成。黑人“领袖”在公众视野中出现——被他们应该为之奋斗的黑人看到。但是，在幕后，有一个白人老板——一个总裁、董事长或其他头衔，在幕后操纵着真正的力量。
It was hot, hot copy, both in the white and the black press. _Life_, _Look_, _Newsweek_ and_Time_ reported us. Some newspaper chains began to run not one story, but a series of three,four, or five "exposures" of the Nation of Islam. The _Reader's Digest_ with its worldwidecirculation of twenty-four million copies in thirteen languages carried an article titled "Mr.Muhammad Speaks," by the writer to whom I am telling this book; and that led off other majormonthly magazines' coverage of us. 
这是热门的、热门的副本，无论是在白人还是黑人媒体中。 《生活》、《看》、《新闻周刊》和《时代》都报道了我们。一些报纸连锁开始不仅刊登一篇文章，而是一系列三篇、四篇或五篇关于伊斯兰国家的“曝光”。《读者文摘》以13种语言在全球发行了2400万份，其中一篇文章题为“穆罕默德先生讲话”，作者是我向这本书讲述的人；这引发了其他主要月刊对我们的报道。

Before very long, radio and television people began asking me to defend our Nation of Islam inpanel discussions and debates. I was to be confronted by hand-picked scholars both whites andsome of those Ph.D. "house" and "yard" Negroes who had been attacking us. Every day, I wasmore incensed with the general misrepresentation and distortion of Mr. Muhammad's teachings; Itruly think that not once did it cross my mind that previously I never had been _inside_ a radio ortelevision station-let alone faced a microphone to audiences of millions of people. Prison debatinghad been my only experience speaking to anyone but Muslims. 
不久之后，广播和电视界人士开始邀请我在小组讨论和辩论中为我们的伊斯兰国家辩护。我将面对精心挑选的白人学者和一些攻击我们的黑人“博士” “房主”和“院子”。每天，我都会对穆罕默德先生的教导被普遍歪曲和扭曲而更加愤怒；我真的认为我从未想过我以前从未在广播电台或电视台内部——更不用说面对数百万人的麦克风了。监狱辩论是我唯一一次与穆斯林以外的人交谈的经历。
From the old hustling days I knew that there were tricks to everything. In the prison debating, Ihad learned tricks to upset my opponents, to catch them where they didn't expect to be caught. Iknew there were bound to be tricks I didn't know anything about arguing on the air. 
从过去的忙碌日子中，我知道每件事都有技巧。在监狱辩论中，我学会了一些技巧来扰乱我的对手，让他们措手不及。我知道在广播上辩论时肯定会有我不知道的技巧。
I knew that if I closely studied what the others did, I could learn things in ahurry to help me todefend Mr. Muhammad and his teachings. 
我知道，如果我仔细研究其他人的做法，我可以快速学习一些东西来帮助我为穆罕默德先生和他的教导辩护。
I'd walk into those studios. The devils and black Ph.D. puppets would be acting so friendly and"integrated" with each other-laughing and calling each other by first names, and all that; it wassuch a big lie it made me sick in my stomach. They would even be trying to act friendly towardme-we all knowing they had asked me there to try and beat out my brains. They would offer mecoffee. I would tell them "No, thanks," to please just tell me where was I supposed to sit.Sometimes the microphone sat on the table before you, at other times a smaller, cylindricalmicrophone was hung on a cord around your neck. From the start, I liked those microphonesbetter; I didn't have to keep constantly aware of my distance from a microphone on the table. 
我会走进那些演播室。恶魔和黑人博士傀儡们会表现得非常友好，彼此“融合”——他们笑着互相称呼对方的名字，以及所有这些事情；这是一个如此大的谎言，让我感到恶心。他们甚至会试图对我表现友好——我们都知道他们邀请我是为了试图打败我。他们会给我咖啡。我会告诉他们“不，谢谢”，请告诉我我应该坐在哪里。有时麦克风放在你面前的桌子上，有时一个更小的圆柱形麦克风挂在你脖子上的绳子上。从一开始，我就更喜欢这些麦克风；我不必不断地注意与桌子上的麦克风的距离。
The program hosts would start with some kind of dice-loading, non-religious introduction for me. Itwould be something like 
节目主持人会以某种掷骰子的方式开始，对我进行非宗教的介绍。这有点像
-and we have with us today the fiery, angry chief Malcolm X of the New York Muslims. . . ." I madeup my own introduction. At home, or driving my car, I practiced until I could interrupt a radio ortelevision host and introduce myself. 
-今天我们邀请到了纽约穆斯林的领袖，脾气暴躁的马尔科姆· X ”我编造了自己的介绍词。在家里或者开车的时候，我反复练习直到能够打断广播或电视节目主持人并介绍自己。
"I represent Mr. Elijah Muhammad, the spiritual head of the fastest-growing group of Muslims inthe Western Hemisphere. We who follow him know that he has been divinely taught and sent tous by God Himself. We believe that the miserable plight of America's twenty million black peopleis the fulfillment of divine prophecy. We also believe the presence today in America of TheHonorable Elijah Muhammad, his teachings among the so-called Negroes, and his naked warningto America concerning her treatment of these so-called Negroes, is all the fulfillment of divineprophecy. I am privileged to be the minister of our 
我代表西方半球增长最快的穆斯林群体的精神领袖，以利亚·穆罕默德先生。我们追随他的人知道他是被上帝亲自传授和派遣给我们的。我们相信美国两千万名黑人的悲惨处境是神圣预言的实现。我们也相信今天在美国存在的尊敬的以利亚·穆罕默德，他在所谓的黑人中的教导，以及他对美国对待这些所谓的黑人的赤裸裸的警告，都是神圣预言的实现。我很荣幸成为我们的
Temple Number Seven here in New York City which is a part of the Nation ofIslam, under thedivine leadership of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad-" 
纽约市的第七清真寺，它是伊斯兰国家的一部分，在尊贵的以利亚·穆罕默德的神领导下——“
I would look around at those devils and their trained black parrots staring at me, while I wascatching my breath-and I had set my tone. 
我会环顾四周，看着那些恶魔和他们训练有素的黑人鹦鹉盯着我，同时我正在喘气——我已经定下了基调。
They would outdo each other, leaping in on me, hammering at Mr. Muhammad, at me, and at theNation of Islam. Those "integration"-mad Negroes-you know what they jum ped on. _Why_couldn't Muslims _see_ that "integration" was the answer to American Negroes' problems? I'd tryto rip that to pieces. 
他们会互相竞争，跳出来攻击我、穆罕默德先生和我所在的伊斯兰国家。那些“融合”疯狂的黑人——你知道他们跳跃的原因。为什么穆斯林看不到“融合”是美国黑人问题的答案？我会试图把它撕成碎片。
"No _sane_ black man really wants integration! No _sane_ white man really wants integration! Nosane black man really believes that the white man ever will give the black man anything morethan token integration. No! The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that for the black man inAmerica the only solution is complete _separation_ from the white man!" 
“没有一个理智的黑人真正想要融合！没有一个理智的白人真正想要融合！没有一个理智的黑人真正相信白人会给予黑人比象征性的融合更多的东西。不！尊贵的以利亚·穆罕默德教导说，对于美国黑人来说，唯一的解决方案是完全与白人分离！”
Anyone who has ever heard me on radio or television programs knows that my technique is non- stop, until what I want to get said is said. I was developing the technique then. 
任何曾经在广播或电视节目中听到过我的人都知道，我的演讲技巧是不间断的，直到我想说的话说完为止。我当时正在开发这种技巧。
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that since Western society is deteriorating, it hasbecome overrun with immorality, and God is going to judge it , and destroy it. And the only way theblack people caught up in this society can be saved is not to _integrate_ into this corrupt society,but to _separate_ from it, to a land of our _own_, where we can reform ourselves, lift up our moralstandards, and try to be godly. The Western world's most learned diplomats have failed to solvethis grave race problem. Her learned legal experts have failed. Her sociologists have failed. Hercivil leaders have failed. Her fraternal leaders have failed. Since all of these have _failed_ tosolve this race problem, it is time for us to sit down and _reason!_ I am certain that we will beforced to agree that it takes _God Himself_ to solve this grave racial dilemma."Every time I mentioned "separation," some of them would cry that we Muslims were standing forthe same thing that white racists and demagogues stood for. I would explain the difference. "No!We reject _segregation_ even more militantly than you say you do! We want _separation_, whichis not the same! The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that _segregation_ is when yourlife and liberty are controlled, regulated, _by someone else_. To _segregate_ means to control.Segregation is that which is forced upon inferiors by superiors. But _separation_ is that which isdone voluntarily, by two equals-for the good of both! The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches usthat as long as our people here in America are dependent upon the white man, we will always bebegging him for jobs, food, clothing, and housing. And he will always control our lives, regulateour lives, and have the power to segregate us. The Negro here in America has been treated like achild. A child stays within the mother until the time of birth! When the time of birth arrives, the childmust be separated, or it will _destroy_ its mother and itself. The mother can't carry that child afterits time. The child cries for and needs its own world!" 
“尊贵的以利亚·穆罕默德教导我们，由于西方社会正在恶化，它已经充满了道德败坏，上帝将要审判它并摧毁它。陷入这个社会中的黑人唯一能够被拯救的方法不是融入这个腐败的社会，而是与它分离，到一个我们自己的土地，在那里我们可以改革自己，提高我们的道德标准，并努力成为虔诚的人。西方世界最博学的外交官们未能解决这个严重的种族问题。她博学的法律专家失败了。她的社会学者们失败了。她的公民领袖们失败了。她的兄弟会领袖们失败了。既然所有这些都未能解决这个种族问题，那么现在是我们坐下来理性思考的时候了！我确信我们会被迫同意，解决这个问题需要上帝本人。每次我提到“分离”，他们中的一些人会哭诉我们穆斯林和白人种族主义者和煽动者站在同一立场上。我会解释其中的区别。“不！我们比你们所说的更加坚决地反对种族隔离！我们要的是分离，这是不一样的！尊贵的以利亚·穆罕默德教导我们，当你们的生活和自由被别人控制、管理时就是种族隔离。而分离是两个平等的人自愿做出的选择——为了双方的利益！尊贵的以利亚·穆罕默德教导我们，只要我们在美国的人们依赖白人，我们就总是乞求他给我们工作、食物、衣服和住房。他将永远控制我们的生活、管理我们的生活，并且有能力将我们隔离开来。美国这里的黑人一直被当作孩子对待。一个孩子在出生前都待在母亲身边！当出生的时刻到来时，孩子必须被分开，否则它会摧毁它的母亲和自己。母亲不能在孩子出生后继续带着它。孩子哭泣着需要自己的世界！”
Anyone who has listened to me will have to agree that I believed in Elijah Muhammad andrepresented him one hundred per cent. I never tried to take any credit for myself. 
任何听过我演讲的人都会同意，我信仰以利亚·穆罕默德并百分之百地代表他。我从不想为自己争取任何荣誉。
I was never in one of those panel discussions without some of them just waiting their chance toaccuse me of "inciting Negroes to violence." I didn't even have to do any special studying toprepare for that one. 
我参加的每一次小组讨论中，总有人等着指责我“煽动黑人进行暴力”。我甚至不需要做任何特别的准备来应对这种指责。
"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America is that the black man in white Christianhands has not grown violent. It _is_ a miracle that 22 million black people have not _risen up_against their oppressors-in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even bythe democratic tradition! It is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued tobelieve in a turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die philosophy! It _is a miracle_that the American black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuriesof hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven! The _miracle_ is that the white man'spuppet Negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with degrees, and otherswho have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the blackmasses quiet until now." 
“基督教在美国所实现的最大奇迹是，白人基督徒手中的黑人没有变得暴力。2200万黑人没有起来反抗他们的压迫者，这确实是一个奇迹——根据所有的道德标准，甚至民主传统，他们这样做都是合理的！一个由黑人组成的国家如此热切地继续相信以德报怨和死后天堂的哲学，这真是一个奇迹！美国黑人在白人的天堂中经历了几个世纪的地狱般的苦难，却仍然是一个和平的民族，这也是一个奇迹！这个奇迹是，白人的傀儡黑人领袖、传教士和受过教育的黑人知识分子以及其他从黑人贫困兄弟身上获利的人，能够一直让黑人群众保持沉默直到现在。”
I guarantee you one thing-every time I was mixed up in those studios with those brainwashed,"integration"-mad black puppets, and those tricky devils trying to rip and tear me down, as long asthe little red light glowed "on the air," I tried to represent Elijah Muhammad and the Nation ofIslam to the utmost. 
我向你保证一件事——每次我和那些被洗脑的、“融合”疯狂的黑人傀儡以及那些试图把我撕成碎片的狡猾恶魔一起出现在这些演播室里，只要红色的小灯亮起“正在广播”，我就会尽力代表以利亚·穆罕默德和伊斯兰国家。
Dr. C. Eric Lincoln's book was published amid widening controversy about us Muslims, at justabout the time we were starting to put on our first big mass rallies. 
林肯博士的书出版时，关于美国穆斯林的争论正愈演愈烈。当时我们刚开始举行第一次大型集会。
Just as the television "Hate That Hate Produced" title had projected that "hate-teaching" image ofus, now Dr. Lincoln's book was titled _The Black Muslims in America_. The press snatched at thatname. "Black Muslims" was in all the book reviews, which quoted from the book only what wascritical of us, and generally praised Dr. Lincoln's writing. 
正如电视片《仇恨产生的仇恨》的标题向我们灌输了“仇恨教育”的形象一样，现在林肯博士的书又取名为《美国黑人穆斯林》 。新闻界抓住了这个名字。《黑人穆斯林》出现在所有的书评中，这些评论引用书中对我们不利的话，并普遍赞扬林肯博士的写作。
The public mind fixed on "Black Muslims." From Mr. Muhammad on down, the name "BlackMuslims" distressed everyone in the Nation of Islam. I tried for at least two years to kill off that"Black Muslims." Every newspaper and magazine writer and microphone I got close to: "_No !_We are black _people_ here in America. Our _religion_ is Islam. We are properly called'Muslims'!" But that "Black Muslims" name never got dislodged.Our mass rallies, from their verybeginning, were astounding successes. Where once Detroit's struggling little Temple One proudlysent a ten-automobile caravan to Chicago to hear Mr. Muhammad, now, from East CoastTemples-the older Temples as well as the new ones that all of the massive publicity had helpedus to bring into being-as many as 150, 200 and even as many as 300 big, chartered buses rolledthe highways to wherever Mr. Muhammad was going to speak. On each bus, two Fruit of Islammen were in charge. Big three-by-nine-foot painted canvas banners hung on the buses' sides, tobe read by the highway traffic and thousands of people at home and on the sidewalks of thetowns the buses passed through. 
公众的脑海中固定着“黑人穆斯林”这个词。从穆罕默德先生开始，“黑人穆斯林”这个名字让伊斯兰国家的每个人都感到苦恼。我至少花了两年时间试图消除“黑人穆斯林”这个称呼。每一个接近我的报纸、杂志作家和麦克风的人都说：“不！我们是美国这里的黑人。我们的宗教是伊斯兰教。我们被正确地称为'穆斯林'！”但是“黑人穆斯林”这个名字从未被取代。
我们的大规模集会从一开始就取得了惊人的成功。曾经底特律的小庙宇一号自豪地派出一个由十辆汽车组成的车队前往芝加哥听穆罕默德先生的演讲，现在，从东海岸的寺庙——包括所有大量宣传帮助我们建立的新老寺庙——多达150、200甚至多达300辆大型包车在公路上行驶，无论穆罕默德先生要去哪里演讲。每辆巴士上都由两名伊斯兰果实组织成员负责。巨大的三英尺乘九英尺的彩绘帆布横幅挂在巴士的侧面，以便公路交通和成千上万在家和巴士经过的城镇人行道上的人们阅读。
Hundreds more Muslims and curious Negroes drove their own cars. And Mr. Muhammad with hispersonal jet plane from Chicago. From the airport to the rally hall, Mr. Muhammad's motorcadehad a siren-screaming police escort. Law agencies once had scoffed at our Nation as "blackcrackpots"; now they took special pains to safeguard against some "white crackpots" causing any"incidents" or "accidents." 
还有数以百计的穆斯林和好奇的黑人开着自己的车。穆罕默德先生从芝加哥乘坐私人飞机抵达。从机场到集会大厅，穆罕默德先生的车队有警笛声不断的警察护送。法律机构曾经嘲笑我们的国家是“黑人疯子”；现在他们特别小心地防止一些“白人疯子”造成任何“事件”或“事故”。
America had never seen such fantastic all-black meetings! To hear Elijah Muhammad, up to tenthousand and more black people poured from public and private transportation to overflow the bighalls we rented, such as the St. Nicholas Arena in New York City, Chicago's Coliseum, andWashington, D.C. 's Uline Arena. 
美国从未见过如此奇妙的全黑人会议！ 聆听伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生的演讲，多达一万名甚至更多的黑人从公共交通工具和私人交通工具涌入我们租用的大厅，如纽约市的圣尼古拉斯竞技场、芝加哥的奥林匹克体育场和华盛顿特区的尤因竞技场。
The white man was barred from attendance-the first time the American black man had everdreamed of such a thing. And that brought us new attacks from the white man and his blackpuppets. "Black segregationists . . . racists!" Accusing us of segregation! Across America, whitesbarring blacks was standard. 
白人被禁止参加——这是美国黑人第一次梦想这样的事情。这让我们受到了白人和他的黑人傀儡的新攻击。“黑人种族隔离主义者…种族主义者！”指责我们进行种族隔离！在美国各地，白人禁止黑人是标准做法。
Many hundreds arrived too late for us to seat them. We always had to wire up outsideloudspeakers. An electric atmosphere excited the great, shifting massesof black people. The longlines, three and four abreast, funneling to the meeting hall, were kept in strict order by Fruit ofIslam men communicating by walkie-talkie. In anterooms just i nside the halls, more Fruit of Islammen and white-gowned, veiled mature Muslim sisters thoroughly searched every man, woman,and child seeking to enter. Any alcohol and tobacco had to be checked, and any objects whichcould possibly be used to attempt to harm Mr. Muhammad. He always seemed deathly afraid thatsome one would harm him, and he insisted that everyone be searched to forestall this. Today Iunderstand better, why. 
许多人来得太晚，我们无法为他们安排座位。我们总是不得不在外面安装扩音器。一种激动人心的电子氛围激发了黑人群众的巨大变化。长长的队伍，三人或四人一排，向会议厅涌去，由通过对讲机进行交流的伊斯兰果实组织成员严格维持秩序。在大厅内的前厅里，更多的伊斯兰果实组织成员和穿着白色长袍、戴着面纱的成年穆斯林姐妹们彻底搜查每一个试图进入的男人、女人和孩子。任何酒精和烟草都必须检查，任何可能被用来伤害穆罕默德先生的物品都必须检查。他总是似乎非常害怕有人会伤害他，他坚持每个人都要接受搜查以预防这种情况的发生。今天，我更好地理解了为什么。
The hundreds of Fruit of Islam men represented contingents which had arrived early thatmorning, from their Temples in the nearest cities. Some were detailed as ushers, who seated thepeople by designated sections. The balconies and the rear half of the main floor were filled withblack people of the general public. Ahead of them were the all-Muslim seating sections-the white- garbed beautiful black sisters, and the dark-suited, white-shirted brothers. A special section nearthe front was for black so-called "dignitaries." Many of these had been invited. Among them wereour black puppet and parrot attackers, the intellectuals and professional Negroes over whom Mr.Muhammad grieved so much, for these were the educated ones who should have been foremostin leading their poor black brothers out of the maze of misery and want. We wanted them to missnot a single syllable of the truths from Mr. Muhammad in person. 
数百名伊斯兰果实组织成员代表了当天早上从附近城市寺庙出发的分遣队。有些人被指派为引座员，他们按照指定的区域安排人们就座。阳台和主楼层的后半部分都挤满了公众黑人。在他们面前是所有穆斯林座位区——穿着白色长袍的美丽黑姐妹和穿着深色西装、白色衬衫的兄弟们。靠近前面的一个特殊区域是为所谓的“要人”准备的。其中许多人是被邀请来的。其中包括我们的黑人傀儡和鹦鹉攻击者，即穆罕默德先生非常悲痛的知识分子和职业黑人，因为这些受过教育的人应该是引领他们的贫穷黑人兄弟走出苦难和贫困迷宫的先锋。我们希望他们不会错过来自穆罕默德先生的任何一个真理。
The front two or three press rows were filled with the black reporters and cameramenrepresenting the Negro press, or those who had been hired by the white man's newspapers,magazines, radio, and television. America's black writers should hold a banquet for Mr.Muhammad. Writing about the Nation of Islam was the path to success for most of the blackwriters who now are recognized. 
前两到三排的新闻界人士都是黑人记者和摄影师，代表黑人媒体，或者是被白人报纸、杂志、广播和电视雇佣的人。美国的黑人作家应该为穆罕默德先生举办一场宴会。对于大多数现在被认可的黑人作家来说，写关于伊斯兰国家的文章是通往成功的道路。
 Up on the speaker's platform, we ministers and other officials of the Nation, entering frombackstage, found ourselves chairs in the five or six rows behind the big chair reserved for Mr.Muhammad. Some of the ministers had come hundreds of miles to be present. We would beturning about in our chairs, beaming with smiles, wringing each other's hands, and exchanging"As-Salaam-Alaikum" and "Wa-Alaikum-Salaam" in our genuine deep rejoicing to see each otheragain. 
在讲台上，我们国家的部长和其他官员从后台进入，发现自己的椅子在穆罕默德先生预留的大椅子后面五六排。一些部长已经走了数百英里才到场。我们会在自己的椅子上转身，面带微笑，紧握着彼此的手，用“As-Salaam-Alaikum”和“Wa-Alaikum-Salaam”互相问候，表达再次见面时真正的深深喜悦。
Always, meeting us older hands in Mr. Muhammad's service for the first time, there were severalnew ministers of small new Temples. My brothers Wilfred and Philbert were respectively now theministers of the Detroit and Lansing Temples. Minister Jeremiah X headed Atlanta's Temple.Minister John X had Los Angeles' Temple. The Messenger's son, Minister Wallace Muhammad,had the Philadelphia Temple. Minister Woodrow X had the Atlantic City Temple. Some of ourministers had unusual backgrounds. The Washington, D.C., Temple Minister Lucius X waspreviously a Seventh Day Adventist and a 32nd degree Mason. Minister George X of theCamden, New Jersey, Temple was a pathologist. Minister David X was previously the minister ofa Richmond, Virginia, Christian church; he and enough of his congregation had become Muslimsso that the congregation split and the majority turned the church into our Richmond Temple. TheBoston Temple's outstanding young Minister Louis X, previously a well-known and rising popularsinger called "The Charmer," had written our Nation's popular first song, titled "White Man'sHeaven is Black Mali's Hell." Minister Louis X had also authored our first play, "Orgena" ("ANegro" spelled backwards); its theme was the all-black trial of a symbolic white man for his worldcrimes against non-whites; found guilty, sentenced to death, he was dragged off shouting aboutall he had done "for the nigra people." 
在穆罕默德先生的领导下，我们这些年长的成员总是第一次见到新部长们。他们来自一些新建的小寺庙。我的兄弟威尔弗雷德和菲尔伯特现在分别担任底特律和兰辛寺的部长。杰里迈亚·X牧师前往亚特兰大寺工作。约翰·X牧师则负责洛杉矶寺的工作。先知之子华莱士·穆罕默德牧师负责费城寺的工作。伍德罗·X牧师则负责大西洋城寺的工作。我们的一些部长有着非同寻常的背景。
Younger even than our talented Louis X were some newer ministers, MinisterThomas J. X of theHartford Temple being one example, and another the Buffalo Temple's Minister Robert J. X. 
甚至比我们才华横溢的路易斯·X更年轻的一些新部长，哈特福德寺的托马斯·J·X牧师就是一个例子，另一个例子是布法罗寺的罗伯特·J·X牧师。
I had either originally established or organized for Mr. Muhammad most of the representedtemples. Greeting each of these Temples' brother ministers would bring back into my mindimages of "fishing" for converts along the streets and from door-to-door wherever the blackpeople were congregated. I remembered the countless meetings in living rooms where maybeseven would be a crowd; the gradually building, building-on up to renting folding chairs for dingylittle storefronts which Muslims scrubbed to spotlessness. 
我最初为穆罕默德先生建立了或组织了大多数代表寺庙。向这些寺庙的兄弟部长们问候，让我想起了在街道上和黑人聚集的地方挨家挨户地“钓鱼”转化信徒的情景。我记得无数个在客厅里举行的会议，也许七个人就是一群人；逐渐建立起来，建立起租用折叠椅的肮脏小店面，穆斯林们把它们擦洗得一尘不染。
We together on a huge hall's speaking platform, and that vast audience before us, miraculouslymanifested, as far as I was concerned, the incomprehensible power of Allah. For the first time, Itruly understood something Mr. Muhammad had told me: he claimed that when he was goingthrough the sacrificial trials of fleeing the black hypocrites from city to city, Allah had often senthim visions of great audiences who would one day hear the teachings; and Mr. Muhammad saidthe visions also buoyed him when he was locked up for years in the white man's prison. 
我们聚集在一个巨大的大厅的演讲台上，面前是庞大的观众群，在我看来，这神奇地体现了难以理解的真主阿拉的力量。我第一次真正理解了穆罕默德先生曾经告诉我的一些事情：他声称当他经历着从一座城市到另一座城市逃离黑人伪君子的牺牲考验时，真主阿拉经常给他看到巨大的观众群将会有一天听到这些教导的景象；穆罕默德先生说，当他被关在白人监狱里数年时，这些景象也鼓舞着他。
The great audience's restless whisperings would cease . . . . 
庞大的观众群的不安的窃窃私语声会停止……
At the microphone would be the Nation's National Secretary John Ali, or the Boston TempleMinister Louis X. They enlivened the all-black atmosphere, speaking of the new world open to theblack man through the Nation of Islam. Sister Tynetta Dynear would speak beautifully of theMuslim women's powerful, vital contributions, of the Muslim women's roles in our Nation's effortsto raise the physical, mental, moral, social, and political condition of America's black people. 
在麦克风前的是全国秘书约翰·阿里或波士顿寺的路易斯·X牧师。他们为全黑人的氛围注入了活力，谈论着通过伊斯兰国家向黑人敞开的新世界。泰妮塔·戴纳姐妹会优美地讲述穆斯林妇女的强大而重要的贡献，以及穆斯林妇女在我们国家提高美国黑人的物质、精神、道德、社会和政治状况的努力中所扮演的角色。
Next, I would come to the microphone, specifically to condition the audienceto hear Mr.Muhammad, who had flown from Chicago to teach us all in person. 
接下来，我会来到麦克风前，特别是为了让观众准备好听穆罕默德先生亲自从芝加哥飞来教导我们所有人。
I would raise up my hand, "_As-Salaikum-Salaam-_" 
我会举起我的手，说：“祝你平安。”
"_Wa-Alaikum-Salaam!_" It was a roared response from the great audience's Muslim seatingsection. 
"祝你平安！"这是来自庞大的观众群中穆斯林座位区的回应。
There was a general pattern that I would follow on these occasions: 
在这些场合，我通常会遵循一个通用的模式：
"My black brothers and sisters-of all religious beliefs, or of no religious beliefs-we all have incommon the greatest binding tie we could have . . . we all are _black_ people! 
"我的黑人兄弟姐妹们——无论信仰何种宗教，或者没有宗教信仰——我们所有人都有一个共同的最伟大的联系……我们都是黑人！"
"I'm not going to take all day telling you some of the greatnesses of The Honorable ElijahMuhammad. I'm just going to tell you now his _greatest_ greatness! He is the _first_, the _only_black leader to identify, to you and me, _who_ is our enemy! 
"我不打算花一整天的时间来告诉你们尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德的一些伟大之处。我现在只想告诉你们他最伟大的地方！他是第一个，也是唯一一个黑人领袖，向我们和你指出了谁是我们的敌人！"
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the first black leader among us with the _courage_ to tell us- out here in public-something which when you begin to think of it back in your homes, you willrealize we black people have been _living_ with, we have been _seeing_, we have been_suffering_, all of our lives! 
"尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德是我们中间第一个有勇气在公众面前告诉我们的黑人领袖——当你回到家里开始思考时，你会意识到我们黑人一直以来都与什么生活在一起，我们看到了什么，我们一直在承受着什么！"
"Our _enemy_ is the _white man!_ 
"我们的敌人是白人！"
"And why is Mr. Muhammad's teaching us this such a great thing? Because when you know_who_ your enemy is, he can no longer keep you divided, and fighting, one brother against theother! Because when you recognize who your enemy is, he can no longer use trickery, promises,lies, hypocrisy, and his evil acts to keep you deaf, dumb, and blinded!"When you recognize _who_ your enemy is, he can no longer brainwash you, he can no longerpull wool over your eyes so that you never stop to see that you are living in pure _hell_ on thisearth, while he lives in pure _heaven_ right on this same earth!-This enemy who tells you that youare both supposed to be worshiping the same white Christian God that-you are told-stands for the_same_ things for _all_ men! 
"为什么穆罕默德先生教导我们这一点是如此伟大的事情？因为当你知道你的敌人是谁时，他就无法再让你分裂和互相斗争了！因为当你认识到你的敌人是谁时，他就无法再使用欺骗、承诺、谎言、虚伪和他的邪恶行为来使你聋哑盲目！当你认识到你的敌人是谁时，他就无法再对你进行洗脑，他就无法再蒙蔽你的眼睛，让你永远无法停下来看到你正生活在这片地球上的纯粹地狱中，而他却在同样的地球上过着纯粹的天堂生活！这个敌人告诉你，你们都应该崇拜同一个白人基督教上帝，据说这个上帝代表着所有人的共同利益！"
"Oh, _yes_, that devil is our enemy. I'll _prove_ it! Pick up any daily newspaper! Read the falsecharges leveled against our beloved religious leader. It only points up the fact that the Caucasianrace never wants any black man who is not their puppet or parrot to speak for our people. ThisCaucasian devil slavemaster does not want or trust us to leave him-yet when we stay hereamong him, he continues to keep us at the very lowest level of his society! 
"哦，是的，那个魔鬼就是我们的敌人。我会证明这一点！拿起任何一份日报！阅读对我们敬爱的宗教领袖提出的虚假指控。这只能说明一个事实，即高加索人种从来不希望有任何不是他们的傀儡或鹦鹉的黑人为我们人民说话。这个高加索恶魔奴隶主不希望或信任我们离开他——然而，当我们留在他身边时，他继续让我们处于他社会的最低层！"
"The white man has always _loved_ it when he could keep us black men tucked awaysomewhere, always out of sight, around the comer! The white man has always _loved_ the kindof black leaders whom he could ask, 'Well, how's things with your people up there?' But becauseMr. Elijah Muhammad takes an uncompromising stand with the white man, the white man_hates_ him! When you hear the _white man_ hate him, you, too, because you don't understandBiblical prophecy, wrongly label Mr. Muhammad-as a racist, a hate-teacher, or of being anti-whiteand teaching black supremacy-" 
"白人一直喜欢把我们黑人藏在某个地方，总是看不见，总是在角落里！白人一直喜欢那种他可以问的黑人领袖，'嗯，你那边的人怎么样？'但是因为伊利亚·穆罕默德先生对白人采取了毫不妥协的立场，白人恨他！当你听到白人恨他时，你也会感到如此，因为你不理解圣经预言，错误地将穆罕默德先生标记为种族主义者、仇恨教师或反白人和教导黑人至上主义。"
The audience suddenly would begin a rustling of turning . . . . 
观众们突然开始发出沙沙声，转过身来……
Mr. Muhammad would be rapidly moving along up a center aisle from the rear-as once he hadentered our humble little mosques-this man whom we regarded as Islam's gentle, meek, brown- skinned Lamb. Stalwart, striding, close-cropped, hand-picked Fruit of Islam guards were a circlesurrounding him. He carried his Holy Bible, his holy Quran. The small, dark pillbox atophis headwas gold-embroidered with Islam's flag, the sun, moon, and stars. The Muslims were crying outtheir adoration and their welcome. "Little Lamb!" "As-Salaikum-Salaam!" "Praise be to Allah!" 
穆罕默德先生会迅速地从后面的中央走道走来，就像他曾经走进我们简陋的小清真寺穆罕默德先生会迅速地从后面的中央走道走来，就像他曾经走进我们简陋的小清真寺一样——这个被我们视为伊斯兰教温和、温顺、棕色皮肤的羔羊的人。坚强、大步流星、短发、经过精心挑选的伊斯兰果卫士们围绕着他。他手持他的圣经和古兰经。他头顶上的小黑色药盒上绣着金色的伊斯兰教旗帜，太阳、月亮和星星。穆斯林们高呼他们的崇拜和欢迎。"小羔羊！" "祝你平安！" "真主保佑！"
Tears would be in more eyes than mine. He had rescued me when I was a convict; Mr.Muhammad had trained me in his home, as if I was his son. I think that my life's peaks ofemotion, until recently, at least, were when, suddenly, the Fruit of Islam guards would stop stifflyat attention, and the platform's several steps would be mounted alone by Mr. Muhammad, and hisministers, including me, sprang around him, embracing him, wringing both his hands . . . . 
眼泪比我还多。当我还是一名罪犯时，他救了我；穆罕默德先生在他的家里训练我，好像我是他的儿子一样。我想，直到最近，至少是我生命中情感的巅峰时刻是，突然间，伊斯兰果卫士们会僵硬地停止立正，而穆罕默德先生独自走上讲台的几级台阶，包括我在内他的部长们围绕着他，拥抱他，紧握着他的双手……
I would turn right back to the microphone, not to keep waiting those world's biggest blackaudiences who had come to hear him. 
我会立刻转身回到麦克风前，而不是继续等待那些来听他演讲的世界上最大的黑人听众。
"My black brothers and sisters-_no_ one will know _who_ we are . . . until _we_ know who weare! We never will be able to _go_ anywhere until we know _where_ we are! The HonorableElijah Muhammad is giving us a true identity, and a true position-the first time they have everbeen _known_ to the American black man! 
"我的黑人兄弟姐妹们——没有人知道我们是谁，直到我们知道我们是谁！在我们知道自己在哪里之前，我们永远无法到达任何地方！尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德正在给我们一个真实的身份和地位——这是美国黑人第一次知道它们的存在！"
"You can be around this man and never dream from his actions the power and the authority hehas-" (Behind me, believe me when I tell you,  I could _feel_ Mr. Muhammad's _power_.) 
"你可以和这个人在一起，永远不会从他的行为中感受到他所拥有的力量和权威——"（相信我，当我告诉你，我可以感觉到穆罕默德先生的力量。）
"He does not _display_, and _parade_, his _power_! But no other black leader in America hasfollowers who will lay down their lives if he says so! And I don't mean all of this non-violent,begging-the-white-man kind of dying . . . all of this sitting-in, sliding-in, wading-in, eating-in,diving-in, and all the rest- "My black brothers and sisters, you have come from your homes to hear-now you are _going_ tohear-America's _wisest_ black man! America's _boldest_black man! America's most _fearless_black man! This wilderness of North America's most _powerful_ black man!" 
"他不会展示和炫耀他的力量！但在美国，没有其他黑人领袖的追随者会像他一样，如果他说，他们就会献出自己的生命！我并不是说所有这些非暴力的、乞求白人的死亡方式……所有这一切静坐、滑行、涉水、进食、潜水和其他所有的行为都是如此。我的黑人兄弟姐妹们，你们从家里来到这里听——现在你们将要听到——美国最聪明的黑人！美国最大胆的黑人！美国最无畏的黑人！北美洲荒野中最强大的黑人的声音！"
Mr. Muhammad would come quickly to the stand, looking out over the vacuum-quiet audience, hisgentle-looking face set, for just a fleeting moment. Then, "As-Salaikum-Salaam-' 
穆罕默德先生会很快走到讲台上，俯视着真空般的寂静观众，他温和的面容在一瞬间变得坚定。然后，"祝你平安-"
" WA-ALAIKUM-SALAAM!" 
"愿你平安！"
The Muslims roared it, as they settled to listen. From experience, they knew that for the next twohours Mr. Muhammad would wield his two-edged sword of truth. In fact, every Muslim worriedthat he overtaxed himself in the length of his speeches, considering his bronchial asthmaticcondition. 
穆斯林们咆哮着，他们坐下来听。从经验中，他们知道在接下来的两个小时里，穆罕默德先生将挥舞他的双重真理之剑。事实上，每个穆斯林都担心他在演讲的长度上过度劳累自己，考虑到他的支气管哮喘状况。
"I don't have a degree like many of you out there before me have. But history don't care anythingabout your degrees. 
"我不像你们中的许多人那样有学位。但是历史不在乎你的学位。"
"The white man, he has filled you with a fear of him from ever since you were little black babies.So over you is the greatest enemy a man can have-and that is fear. I know some of you are afraidto listen to the truth-you have been raised on fear and lies. But I am going to preach to you thetruth until you are free of that fear . . . . 
"白人，他让你们从小就对他充满了恐惧。因此，你们最大的敌人就是恐惧。我知道你们中的一些人害怕听到真相——你们一直被恐惧和谎言所包围。但我会向你们宣扬真相，直到你们摆脱恐惧……"
"Your slavemaster, he brought you over here, and of your past everything was destroyed. Today,you do not know your true language. What tribe are you from? You would not recognize yourtribe's name if you heard it. You don't know nothing about your true culture. You don't even knowyour family's real name. You are wearing a _white man's_ name! The white slave-master, who_hates_ you! 
"你们的奴隶主，他把你们带到这里来，你们的过去一切都被摧毁了。今天，你们不知道自己真正的语言是什么。你们来自哪个部落？即使听到自己部落的名字，你们也不会认出它。你们对自己的文化一无所知。你们甚至不知道自己家族的真正名字。你们穿着一个白人奴隶主给你们取的名字！这个憎恨你们的白色奴隶主！"
"You are a people who think you know all about the Bible, and all aboutChristianity. You even arefoolish enough to believe that nothing is _right_ but Christianity! 
"你们是一个认为自己了解圣经和基督教的人。你们甚至愚蠢到相信除了基督教，没有其他东西是正确的！"
"You are the planet Earth's only group of people ignorant of yourself, ignorant of your own kind, ofyour true history, ignorant of your enemy! You know nothing at _all_ but what your whiteslavemaster has chosen to tell you. And he has told you only that which will benefit himself, andhis own kind. He has taught you, for his benefit, that you are a neutral, shiftless, helpless so- called 'Negro.' 
"你们是地球上唯一一群不了解自己的人，不了解自己的同类，不了解自己的真实历史，不了解自己的敌人！除了你们的白色奴隶主选择告诉你们的事情之外，你们一无所知。而他只告诉了你们那些对他和他的同类有益的事情。为了他的利益，他教给你们，你们是中立的、无能的、无助的所谓的'黑人'。"
"I say _'so-called'_ because you are _not_ a _'Negro.'_ There is no such thing as a race of_'Negroes.'_ You are members of the Asiatic nation, from the tribe of _Shabazz_! 'Negro' is afalse label 
"我说'所谓的'，是因为你们不是'黑人'。没有所谓的'黑人种族'。你们是来自沙巴兹部落的亚洲民族的成员！'黑人'是一个错误的标签。"
forced on you by your slavemaster! He has been pushing things onto you and me and our kindever since he brought the first slave shipload of us black people here-" 
"是你们的奴隶主强加给你们的！自从他第一次把一船黑人奴隶运到这里以来，他就一直在把东西推给我们和我们这样的人——"
When Mr. Muhammad paused, the Muslims before him cried out, "Little Lamb!" . . ."All praise isdue to Allah!" . . ."_Teach_, Messenger!" He would continue. 
当穆罕默德先生停顿时，他面前的穆斯林们高呼：“小羊羔！”“一切荣耀归于真主！”“教导我们吧，使者！”他会接着讲下去。
"The _ignorance_ we of the black race here in America have, and the _self-hatred_ we have, theyare fine examples of what the white slavemaster has seen fit to teach to us. Do we show the plaincommon sense, like every other people on this planet Earth, to unite among ourselves? No! Weare humbling ourselves, sitting-in, and begging-in, trying to _unite_ with the slavemaster! I don'tseem able to imagine any more ridiculous sight. A thousand ways every day, the white man istelling you 'You can't live here, you can't enter here, you can't eat here, drink here, walk here,work here, you can't ride here, you can't play here,you can't study here.' Haven't we yet seenenough to see that he has no plan to _unite_ with you? 
 "我们这些在美国的黑人种族所表现出的无知和自我憎恨，正是白人奴隶主认为适合教导我们的例子。我们是否像地球上其他民族一样表现出了基本的常识，团结在一起？不！我们正在让自己谦卑，静坐示威、乞求示威，试图与奴隶主团结在一起！我似乎无法想象更荒谬的景象。每天有一千种方式，白人告诉你'你不能在这里生活，不能进入这里，不能在这里吃饭、喝水、走路、工作、骑车、玩耍、学习。'我们还没有看到足够的证据表明他没有与你团结的计划吗？"
"You have tilled his fields! Cooked his food! Washed his clothes! You have cared for his wife andchildren when he was away. In many cases, you have even suckled him at your _breast_! Youhave been far and away better Christians than this slave-master who _taught_ you hisChristianity! 
"你们耕种了他的土地！煮了他的食物！洗了他的衣服！当他不在时，你们照顾他的妻子和孩子。
"You have sweated blood to help him build a country so rich that he can today afford to give awaymillions-even to his _enemies_! And when those enemies have gotten enough from him to thenbe able to attack him, you have been his brave soldiers, dying for him. And you have been alwayshis most faithful servant during the so-called 'peaceful' times- "And, _still_, this Christian American white man has not got it in him to find the human _decency_,and enough sense of _justice_, to recognize us, and accept us, the black people who have doneso much for him, as fellow human beings!" 
"你们为他建立了一个如此富有的国家，以至于今天他可以捐出数百万——甚至给他的敌人！当这些敌人从他那里得到了足够的支持来攻击他时，你们成为了他勇敢的士兵，为他献出了生命。在所谓的'和平'时期，你们一直是他最忠诚的仆人——"然而，这个基督教美国白人仍然没有找到人类的尊严和足够的正义感，来承认我们黑人为他的付出，并接受我们作为人类同胞的存在！"
"YAH, Man!" . . ."_Um-huh_!" "_Teach_, Messenger!" . . ."_Yah_!" . . ."_Tell 'em_!"  . . ."You_right_!" . . ."Take your _time_ up there, little Messenger!" . . ."Oh, _yes_!" 
"Yah, Man!"... "Um-huh!" "Teach, Messenger!"... "Yah!"... "Tell 'em!"... "You right!"... "Take your time up there, little Messenger!"... "Oh, yes!"
Others besides the Muslims would be shouting now. We Muslims were less extroverted thanChristian Negroes. It would sound now like an old-fashioned camp meeting. 
除了穆斯林，其他人也会开始喊叫。我们穆斯林比基督教黑人更内向。现在听起来就像是一个老式的营地会议。
"So let us, the black people, _separate_ ourselves from this white man slavemaster, whodespises us so much! You are out here begging him for some so-called '_integration_!' But whatis this slavemaster white, _rapist_, going about saying! He is saying _he_ won't integrate becauseblack blood will_mongrelize_ his race! _He_ says that-and look at _us_! Turn around in yourseats and look at each other! This slavemaster white man already has '_integrated_' us until youcan hardly find among us today any more than a very few who are the black color of ourforeparents!" 
"所以，让我们黑人把自己与这个白人奴隶主分开，他非常鄙视我们！你们在这里乞求他所谓的'融合'！但是这个白人奴隶主、强奸犯在说什么呢？他说他不会融合，因为黑人的血液会玷污他的种族！他说这话——看看我们！转过身来看看彼此！这个白人奴隶主已经把我们'融合'了，以至于今天在我们中间你几乎找不到比我们的祖先更黑的人了！"
"God-a-mighty, the man's right!" . . ."_'Teach_, Messenger-" "_Hear_ him! _Hear_ him!" 
"上帝啊，这个人是对的！"... "'教导我们吧，使者'—— '听他的话！听他的话！'"
"He has left such a little black in us," Mr. Muhammad would go on, "that now he despises us sobad-meaning he despises _himself_, for what he has _done_ to us-that he tells us that _legally_ ifwe have got _one drop_ of black blood in us, that means you are all-black as far as his laws areconcerned! Well, if that's all we've got left, we want to _reclaim_ that one drop!" 
"他在我们身上留下了这么少的黑人血统，"穆罕默德先生继续说道，"以至于他现在非常"他在我们身上留下了这么少的黑人血统，"穆罕默德先生继续说道，"以至于他现在非常鄙视我们——这意味着他鄙视自己，因为他对我们的所作所为——他告诉我们，从法律上来说，如果我们身上有一滴黑人血液，那么在他的法律眼中，你就是完全的黑皮肤！好吧，如果这是我们所拥有的一切，那么我们要重新夺回那一滴血！"
Mr. Muhammad's frail strength could be seen to be waning. But he would teach on: 
穆罕默德先生虚弱的力量似乎正在减弱。但他会继续教导：
"So let us _separate_ from this white man, and for the same reason _he_ says-in time to saveourselves from any more '_integration_! ' 
"所以让我们与这个白人分开，出于同样的原因——他所说的——及时拯救自己免受更多的'融合'！"
"Why _shouldn't_ this white man who likes to think and call himself so good, and so generous,this white man who finances even his enemies-why _shouldn't_ he subsidize a separate state, aseparate territory, for we black people who have been such faithful slaves and servants? Aseparate territory on which we can lift _ourselves_ out of these white man's _slums_ for us, andhis _breadlines_ for us. And even for _those_ he is complaining that we cost him too much! Wecan do something for _ourselves_! We never have done what we _could_-because we have beenbrainwashed so well by the slavemaster white man that we must come to him, begging him, foreverything we want, and need-" 
"为什么这个喜欢自认为善良、慷慨的白人不应该资助一个独立的国家，一个独立的领土，为我们这些一直如此忠诚的奴隶和仆人黑人？在一个独立的领土上，我们可以摆脱白人为我们提供的贫民窟和救济线。即使是对于那些他抱怨我们花费了他太多的人！我们可以为自己做些什么！我们从来没有做过我们能做的——因为我们被白人奴隶主洗脑了，以至于我们必须向他乞求我们想要和需要的一切——"
 After perhaps ninety minutes, behind Mr. Muhammad, every minister would have to restrainhimself from bolting up to his side, to urge him that it was enough. He would be pressing hishands tightly against the edges of the speaker's stand, to support himself. 
大约90分钟后，在穆罕默德先生身后，每一位部长都会不得不控制自己，不跳起来走到他身边，劝他够了。他会紧紧抓住讲台的边缘，以支撑自己。
"We black people don't _know_ what we can do. You never can know what _anything_ can do- until it is set _free_, to act by itself! If you have a cat in your house that you pamper and pet, youhave to free that cat, set it on its _own_, in the woods, before you can see that the cat had it inhim to shelter and feed itself! 
"我们黑人不知道自己能做什么。你永远不知道任何事情能做什么——直到它被释放，自己行动起来！如果你家里有一只你宠爱的猫，你必须让这只猫自由自在地在树林里生活，才能看到它有自己寻找食物和庇护的能力！"
"We, the black people here in America, we never have been _free_ to find _out_ what we reallycan _do_! We have knowledge and experience to pool to do for ourselves! All of our lives wehave farmed-we can grow our own food. We can set up factories to manufacture our ownnecessities! We can build other kinds of businesses, to establish trade, and commerce-andbecome independent, as other civilized people are- "We can _throw off_ our brainwashing, and our self-hate, and live as _brothers_ together . . . 
"我们，美国这里的黑人，从来没有自由地发现自己真正能做什么！我们有知识和经验可以共同为自己做点什么！我们一生都在务农——我们可以自己种植食物。我们可以建立自己的工厂来制造必需品！我们可以建立其他类型的企业，建立贸易和商业——像其他文明人一样变得独立——“我们可以摆脱我们的洗脑和自我仇恨，像兄弟一样生活在一起……"
". . . some land of our _own_! . . . Something for _ourselves_! .  . . leave this white slavemaster to_himself_. . . ." 
"……我们自己的土地！……为我们自己做些什么！……让这个白人奴隶主自生自灭吧……"
Mr. Muhammad always stopped abruptly when he was unable to speak any longer. 
当穆罕默德先生无法再继续说话时，他总是突然停下来。
The standing ovation, a solid wall of sound, would go on unabating. 
持续的起立鼓掌，像一堵坚实的墙一样的声音，将会毫不减弱地继续下去。
Standing up there, flailing my arms, finally I could quiet the audiences as Fruit of Islam ushersbegan to pass along the seating rows the large, waxed paperbuckets we used to take up thecollection. I would speak. 
我站在那里，挥舞着手臂，终于可以让观众安静下来，伊斯兰果实组织的引座员开始在座位上传递我们用来收钱的大纸桶。我开始讲话。
"You _know_, from what you have just heard, that no white money finances The Honorable ElijahMuhammad and his program-to 'advise' him and 'contain' him! Mr. Muhammad's program, and hisfollowers, are not 'integrated.' Mr. Muhammad's program and organization are _all_-black! 
"你们知道，从你们刚刚听到的，没有白人的钱资助尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德和他的计划——去'劝告'他并'遏制'他！穆罕默德先生的计划和他的追随者们不是'融合'的。穆罕默德先生的计划和组织都是全黑人的！"
"We are the _only_ black organization that _only_ black people support! These so-called 'Negroprogress' organizations-Why, they insult your intelligence, claiming they are fighting in yourbehalf, to get you the equal rights you are asking for . . . claiming they are _fighting_ the whiteman who refuses to give you your rights. Why, the white man _supports_ those organizations! Ifyou belong, you pay your two, or three, or five dollars a year-but _who_ gives those organizationsthose two, and three, and five _thousand_ dollar donations? The _white_ man! He _feeds_ thoseorganizations! So he controls those organizations! He _advises_ them-so he _contains_ them!Use your common sense-aren't you going to advise and control and contain anyone that yousupport, like your child? 
"我们是唯一一个只有黑人支持的黑人组织！这些所谓的'黑人进步'组织——为什么，他们侮辱你的智慧，声称他们在为你的利益而战，让你得到你所要求的平等权利……声称他们正在与拒绝给你权利的白人作斗争。为什么，白人支持那些组织！如果你属于那些组织，你每年支付两、三或五美元的会费——但是谁给那些组织两万、三万或五千美元的捐款呢？是白人！他喂养那些组织！所以他控制那些组织！他给他们建议——所以他遏制他们！用你的常识想一想——难道你不会像对待你的孩子一样去建议、控制和遏制你所支持的人吗？"
"The white man would love to support Mr. Elijah Muhammad. Because if Mr. Muhammad had torely on his support, he could _advise_ M r. Muhammad. My black brothers and sisters, it is _only_because _your_ money, _black_ money, supports Mr. Muhammad, that he can hold these all- black meetings from city to city, telling us black men the _truth_! That's why we are asking foryour all-black _support_!" 
"白人很乐意支持伊利亚·穆罕默德先生。因为如果穆罕默德先生完全依赖他的支持，他就可以给穆罕默德先生提建议。我的黑人兄弟姐妹们，正是因为你们的钱，黑人的钱，支持了穆罕默德先生，他才能在各个城市举行全黑人的会议，告诉我们黑人真相！这就是为什么我们要求你们全力支持的原因！"
Nearly all bills-and far from all one-dollar bills, either, filled the waxed buckets. The buckets wereswiftly emptied, then refilled, as the Fruit of Islam ushers covered the entire audience. 
几乎所有的钞票——远非所有的一美元钞票——都装满了蜡桶。随着伊斯兰果实组织的引座员覆盖整个观众席，这些桶子迅速地被清空，然后又重新装满。
The audience atmosphere was almost as if the people had gone limp. The collections alwayscovered the rally expenses, and anything beyond that helped to continue building the Nation ofIslam. 
观众的气氛几乎像是人们已经变得软弱无力了。这些捐款总是能够支付集会的费用，除此之外的任何费用都有助于继续建设伊斯兰国家。
After several big rallies, Mr. Muhammad directed that we would admit the white press. Fruit ofIslam men thoroughly searched them, as everyone else was searched-their notebooks, theircameras, camera cases, and whatever else they carried. Later, Mr. Muhammad said that _any_whites who wanted to hear the truth could attend our public rallies, until a small separate sectionfor whites was filled. 
在几次大型集会之后，穆罕默德先生指示我们允许白人媒体参加。伊斯兰果实组织的人像搜查其他人一样彻底搜查了他们——他们的笔记本、相机、相机包和他们携带的任何其他物品。后来，穆罕默德先生说，任何想要听到真相的白人都可以参加我们的公开集会，直到一个单独的白人分区被填满为止。
Most whites who came were students and scholars. I would watch their congealed and reddenedfaces staring up at Mr. Muhammad. "The white man _knows_ that his acts have been those of adevil!" I would watch also the faces of the professional black men, the so-called intellectuals whoattacked us. They possessed the academic know-how, they possessed the technical and thescientific skills that could help to lead their mass of poor, black brothers out of our condition. Butall these intellectual and professional black men could seem to think of was humbling themselves,and begging, trying to "integrate" with the so-called "liberal" white man who was telling them, "Intime . . . everything's going to work out one day . . . just wait and have patience." Theseintellectual and professional Negroes couldn't use what they knew for the benefit of their ownblack kind simply because even among themselves they were disunited. United amongthemselves, united with their own kind, they could have benefited black people all over the world! 
大多数白人都是学生和学者。我会看着他们凝固的、发红的脸仰望着穆罕默德先生。"白人知道他的行为就像一个魔鬼！"我也会看着那些攻击我们的专业黑人男子，那些所谓的知识分子的面孔。他们拥有学术知识，拥有技术和科学技能，可以帮助带领他们的大量贫困黑人兄弟摆脱我们的处境。但是所有这些知识分子和专业黑人男子似乎只能想到的是卑躬屈膝，乞求，试图与所谓的“自由”白人融合在一起，而这些人告诉他们：“迟早……一切都会好起来的……只要等待并保持耐心。”这些知识分子和专业黑人无法利用他们所知道的东西来造福他们自己的人种，仅仅是因为他们甚至在自己之间也是不团结的。如果他们之间团结一致，与自己的同类团结一致，他们本可以为全世界的黑人谋福利！
I would watch the faces of those intellectual and professional Negroes growing grave, and set-asthe truth hit home to them. We were watched. Our telephones were tapped. Still right today, onmy home telephone, if I said, "I'm going to bomb the Empire State Building," I guarantee you infive minutes it would be surrounded. When I was speaking publicly sometimes I'd guess whichwere F.B.I. faces in the audience, or other types of agents. Both thepolice and the F.B.I. intentlyand persistently visited and questioned us. "I do not fear them," Mr. Muhammad said. "I have allthat I need-the truth." 
我会看着那些知识分子和专业黑人男子的脸变得严肃，当真相击中他们时。我们被监视着。我们的电话被窃听。即使在今天，如果我在我的家里说：“我要炸掉帝国大厦”，我保证在五分钟内它就会被包围。当我公开演讲时，我有时会猜测观众中哪些是联邦调查局的人或其他类型的特工。警察和联邦调查局都密切而持久地访问和询问我们。“我不害怕他们，”穆罕默德先生说。“我拥有我所需要的一切——真相。”
Many a night, I drifted off to sleep, filled with wonder at how the two-edged-sword teachings sohurt, confused, concerned, and upset the government full of men trained highly in all of themodern sciences. I felt that it never could have been unless The Most Learned One, AllahHimself, had given the little fourth-grade-trained Messenger something. 
许多个夜晚，我入睡时充满了惊奇，思考着这把双刃剑的教义是如何伤害、困惑、关注和扰乱了政府，而政府里的人都是受过现代科学高度训练的。我觉得这不可能发生，除非最有学问的人——真主自己——给了这个只受过四年级教育的信使一些东西。

Black agents were sent to infiltrate us. But the white man's "secret" spy often proved, first of all, ablack man. I can't say _all_ of them, of course, there's no way to know-but some of them, afterjoining us , and hearing, seeing and _feeling_ the truth for every black man, revealed their roles tous. Some resigned from the white man's agencies and came to work in the Nation of Islam. A fewkept their jobs to counterspy, telling us the white man's statements and plans about our Nation.This was how we learned that after wanting to know what happened within our Temples, the whitelaw agencies' second major co ncern was the thing that I believe still ranks today as a big worryamong America's penologists: the steadily increasing rate at which black convicts embrace Islam. 
黑人特工被派来渗透我们。但是白人的“秘密”间谍往往首先被证明是黑人。当然，我不能说所有的特工都是如此，没有办法知道——但是他们中的一些人，在加入我们之后，听到、看到和感受到每个黑人的真相后，向我们透露了自己的角色。有些人辞去了白人机构的职务，来到伊斯兰国家工作。少数人保留了他们的工作以进行反间谍活动，告诉我们白人对我们国家的声明和计划。这就是我们如何得知，在想知道我们的寺庙里发生了什么之后，白人法律机构第二个主要关注的问题是，我相信这个问题仍然是今天美国刑法学家的一大担忧：黑人罪犯信奉伊斯兰教的比例不断增加。
Generally, while still in prison, our convict-converts preconditioned themselves to meet ourNation's moral laws. As it had happened with me, when they left prison, they entered a Templefully qualified to become registered Muslims. In fact, convict-converts usually were betterprepared than were numerous prospective Muslims who never had been inside a prison. 
通常，在监狱里时，我们的罪犯皈依者就为自己符合我们国家的宗教法律做好了准备。就像我一样，当他们离开监狱时，他们进入了一个清真寺，完全有资格成为注册的穆斯林。事实上，与从未进过监狱的众多潜在穆斯林相比，罪犯皈依者通常准备得更好。
We were not nearly so easy to enter as a Christian church. One did not merely declare himself afollower of Mr. Muhammad, then continue leading the same old, sinful, immoral life. The Muslimfirst had to change his physical and moralself to meet our strict rules. To remain a Muslim he hadto maintain those rules. 
我们并不像基督教会那样容易加入。一个人不能仅仅宣布自己是穆罕默德先生的追随者，然后继续过着同样的旧的、有罪的、不道德的生活。穆斯林首先必须改变自己的身心来符合我们的严格规则。为了保持穆斯林的身份，他必须遵守这些规则。
Few temple meetings were held, for instance, without the minister looking down upon somefreshly shaved bald domes of new Muslim brothers in the audience. They had just banished fromtheir lives forever that phony, lye-conked, metallic-looking hair, or "the process," as some call itthese days. It grieves me that I don't care where you go, you see this symbol of ignorance andself-hate on so many Negroes' heads. I know it's bound to hurt the feelings of some of my goodconked non-Muslim friends-but if you study closely any conked or "processed" Negro, you usuallyfind he is an ignorant Negro. Whatever "show" or "front" he affects, his hair lye-cooked to be"white-looking" fairly shouts to everyone who looks at his head, "I'm ashamed to be a Negro." Hewill discover, just as I did, that he will be much-improved mentally whenever he discovers enoughblack self-pride to have that mess clipped off, and then wear the natural hair that God gives blackmen to wear. 
例如，如果没有牧师俯视观众中一些新穆斯林兄弟剃光的秃头，那么很少有清真寺会议举行。他们刚刚永远地从他们的生活中驱逐了那种虚假的、染过色的、金属般的头发，或者像现在一些人所说的“过程”。无论您走到哪里，都会看到这种无知和自我憎恨的象征，这让我感到非常难过。我知道这肯定会伤害到我的一些好心的染发非穆斯林朋友的感情——但是如果您仔细观察任何染发或“处理”过的黑人，您通常会发现他是一个无知的黑人。无论他表现出什么样的“外表”或“形象”，他的头发被染成“白色”的样子向每个看着他的人大声呼喊：“我为是一个黑人而感到羞耻。”他会像我一样发现，每当他有足够的黑人自豪感来剪掉那团乱糟糟的头发，然后戴上上帝赋予黑人的自然头发时，他的精神状态会有很大的改善。
No Muslim smokes-that was another of our rules. Some prospective Muslims found it moredifficult to quit tobacco than others found quitting the dope habit. But black men and women quitmore easily when we got them to consider seriously how the white man's government cared lessabout the public's health than about continuing the tobacco industry's _billions_ in tax revenue."What does a serviceman pay for a carton of cigarettes?" a prospective Muslim convert would beasked. It helped him to see that every regularly priced carton he bought meant that the whiteman's government took around two dollars of a black man's hard-earned money for taxes, not fortobacco. 
没有穆斯林吸烟——这是我们的另一个规则。一些潜在的穆斯林发现戒烟比戒除毒瘾更难。但是当我们让黑人男女认真考虑白人政府对公众健康的关注程度不如继续烟草业的数十亿美元税收时，他们更容易戒烟。“一个军人买一盒香烟要花多少钱？”一个潜在的穆斯林皈依者会被问到。这有助于他看到，他每买一盒定价合理的香烟，就意味着白人政府从黑人辛苦挣来的钱中拿走了大约两美元的税款，而不是为了烟草。
You may have read somewhere-a lot has been written concerning it-about the Nation of Islam'sphenomenal record of dope-addiction cures of longtime junkies . In fact, the _New York Times_carried a story about how some of the social agencies have asked representatives of the Muslimprogram for clinical suggestions.The Muslim program began with recognizing that color and addiction have a distinct connection. Itis no accident that in the entire Western Hemisphere, the greatest localized concentration ofaddicts is in _Harlem_. 
您可能已经在某个地方读到过——关于这个问题已经写了很多——关于伊斯兰国家的非凡记录，即长期吸毒成瘾者的戒毒治疗。事实上
Our cure program's first major ingredie nt was the painfully patient work of Muslims who previouslywere junkies themselves. 
我们戒毒计划的第一个重要组成部分是以前曾是吸毒成瘾者的穆斯林所进行的极其耐心的工作。
In the ghetto's dope jungle, the Muslim ex-junkies would fish out addicts who knew them back inthose days. Then with an agonizing patience that might span anywhere from a few months to ayear, our ex-ju nkie Muslims would conduct the addicts through the Muslim six-point therapeuticprocess. 
在贫民窟的毒品丛林中，穆斯林前吸毒成瘾者会找出那些认识他们的人。然后，我们的前吸毒成瘾的穆斯林会以可能持续数月到一年的极度耐心，引导吸毒成瘾者通过穆斯林的六点治疗过程。
The addict first was brought to admit to himself that he was an addict. Secondly, he was taught_why_ he used narcotics. Third, he was shown that there was a _way_ to stop addiction. Fourth,the addict's shattered self-image, and ego, were built up until the addict realized that he had,_within_, the self-power to end his addiction. Fifth, the addict voluntarily underwent a cold turkeybreak with drugs. Sixth, finally cured, now an ex-addict completes the cycle by "fishing" up otheraddicts whom he knows, and supervising their salvaging. 
首先，吸毒成瘾者被带到承认自己是一个吸毒成瘾者。其次，他被教导为什么使用毒品。第三，他看到了一种停止成瘾的方法。第四，吸毒成瘾者的破碎的自我形象和自我被建立起来，直到吸毒成瘾者意识到他内在地有自我力量来结束他的成瘾。第五，吸毒成瘾者自愿地进行戒毒。第六，最终治愈后，现在一个前吸毒成瘾者通过“钓鱼”找到他知道的其他吸毒成瘾者，并监督他们的救助，完成了这个循环。
This sixth stage always instantly eliminated what so often defeats the average social agencies- the characteristic addict's hostility and suspicion. The addict who is "fished" up knew personallythat the Muslim approaching him very recently had the same fifteen to thirty dollar a day habit.The Muslim may be this addict's buddy; they had plied the same dope jungle. They even mayhave been thieves together. The addict had _seen_ the Muslim drifting off to sleep leaningagainst a building, or stepping as high over a matchstick as if it were a dog. And the Muslim,approaching the addict, uses the same old junkie jungle la nguage.Like the alcoholic, the junkie can never start to cure himself until he recognizes and accepts histrue condition. The Muslim sticks like a leech, drumming at his old junkie  buddy, "You're hooked,man!" It might take months before the addict comes to grips with this. The curative program isnever really underway until this happens. 
第六阶段总是立即消除了经常击败普通社会机构的特点——吸毒成瘾者的敌意和怀疑。被“钓”起来的吸毒成瘾者亲身知道，最近与他接触的穆斯林每天有15到30美元的习惯。这个穆斯林可能是这个吸毒成瘾者的伙伴；他们曾经在同一个毒品丛林中徘徊。他们甚至可能一起偷窃。吸毒成瘾者看到穆斯林靠在建筑物上打盹，或者像狗一样跳过一根火柴棍。而穆斯林在接近吸毒成瘾者时，使用同样的老吸毒者丛林语言。就像酗酒者一样，吸毒成瘾者永远不会开始治愈自己，直到他认识到并接受自己的真实情况。穆斯林像一只水蛭一样粘着，用他的老吸毒者朋友的语言敲打着他：“你上瘾了，伙计！”这可能需要几个月的时间才能让吸毒成瘾者接受这一点。治疗计划从未真正开始，直到这种情况发生。
The next cure-phase is the addict's realization of why he takes dope. Still working on his man,right in the old jungle locale, in dives that you wouldn't believe existed, the Muslim often collectsaudiences of a dozen junkies . They listen only because they know the clean-cut proud Muslimhad earlier been like them. 
下一阶段是吸毒成瘾者意识到自己为什么吸毒。穆斯林仍然在他的老丛林地区工作，在你不会相信存在的潜水中，他经常聚集了十几个吸毒成瘾者的听众。他们只听是因为 他们知道这个整洁自豪的穆斯林之前和他们一样。
Every addict takes junk to escape something, the Muslim explains. He explains that most blackjunkies  really are trying to narcotize themselves against being a black man in the white man'sAmerica. But, actually, the Muslim says, the black man taking dope is only helping the white manto "prove" that the black man is nothing. 
每个吸毒成瘾者都以吸食毒品来逃避某些事情，穆斯林解释说。他解释说，大多数黑人吸毒成瘾者实际上试图用麻醉自己来对抗成为白人美国中的黑人。但是，实际上，穆斯林说，吸食毒品的黑人只是在帮助白人“证明”黑人什么都不是。
The Muslim talks confidentially, and straight. "Daddy, you know I know how you feel. Wasn't I rightout here with you? Scratching like a monkey, smelling all bad, living mad, hungry, stealing andrunning and hiding from Whitey. Man, what's a black man buying Whitey's dope for but to makeWhitey richer-killing yourself!" 
穆斯林私下里坦诚地交谈。“爸爸，你知道我了解你的感受。我不是和你一起在这里吗？像猴子一样抓挠，闻起来很臭，疯狂地生活，饥饿，偷窃和奔跑，躲避白人。伙计，黑人买白人的毒品是为了什么，除了让白人更富有——自杀！”
The Muslim can tell when his quarry is ready to be shown that the way for him to quit dope isthrough joining the Nation of Islam. The addict is brought into the local Muslim restaurant, he mayoccasionally be exposed to some other social situations-among proud, clean Muslims who showeach other mutual affection and respect instead of the familiar hostility of the ghetto streets. Forthe first time in years, the addict hears himself called, genuinely, "Brother,""Sir" and "Mr." No onecares about his past. His addiction may casually be mentioned, but if so, it is spoken of as merelyan especially tough challenge that he must face. Everyone whom this addict meets is confidentthat he will kick his habit. 
当穆斯林知道他的猎物已经准备好被展示时，他可以通过加入伊斯兰国家来戒除毒品。吸毒成瘾者被带到当地的穆斯林餐厅，他可能会偶尔接触到一些其他社交场合——在自豪、干净的穆斯林人之间，他们彼此表达着相互的爱和尊重，而不是熟悉的贫民窟街道上的敌意。多年来，吸毒成瘾者第一次听到别人真诚地称呼他为“兄弟”、“先生”或“先生”。没有人关心他的过去。他的毒瘾可能只是被随意提及，但如果是的话，也只是把它当作一种特别艰难的挑战，他必须面对。每个吸毒成瘾者遇到的人都相信他会戒掉毒瘾。
As the addict's new image of himself builds, inevitably he begins thinking that he can break thehabit. For the first time he is feeling the effects of black self-pride. 
随着吸毒成瘾者对自己的新形象的建立，他不可避免地开始认为他可以戒掉毒瘾。第一次，他感受到了黑人自尊心的作用。
That's a powerful combination for a man who has been existing in the mud of society. In fact,once he is motivated no one can change more completely than the man who has been at thebottom. I call myself the best example of that. 
对于一个一直生活在社会底层的人来说，这是一个强大的组合。事实上，一旦他有了动力，没有人能比一直处于底层的人更能彻底地改变自己。我称自己是最好的例子。
Finally, vitally, this addict will decide for himself that he wants to go on cold turkey. This means toendure the physical agonies of abruptly quitting dope. 
最后，至关重要的是，这个吸毒成瘾者将决定自己想要继续戒毒。这意味着忍受突然戒毒的肉体痛苦。
When this time comes, ex-addict Muslims will arrange to spend the necessary days in around- the-clock shifts, attending the addict who intends to purge himself, on the way to becoming aMuslim. 
当这个时刻到来时，前吸毒成瘾的穆斯林会安排在全天候轮班中度过必要的日子，陪伴着打算净化自己的吸毒成瘾者，走上成为穆斯林的道路。
When the addict's withdrawal sets in, and he is screaming, cursing, and begging, "Just one shot,man!" the Muslims are right there talking junkie jargon to him. "Baby, knock that monkey off yourback! Kick that habit! Kick Whitey off your back!" The addict, writhing in pain, his nose and eyesrunning, is pouring sweat from head to foot. He's trying to knock his head against the wall, flailinghis arms, trying to fight his attendants, he is vomiting, suffering diarrhea. "Don't hold nothing back!Let Whitey go, baby! You're going to stand tall, man! I can see you now in the Fruit of Islam!" 
当吸毒成瘾者的戒断症状开始发作，他尖叫、咒骂、乞求：“就一次，老兄！”穆斯林们就在他身边用吸毒者的黑话和他交谈。“宝贝，把那猴子从你背上打下来！戒掉那个习惯！把白佬从你背上踢下去！”吸毒成瘾者痛苦地扭动着身体，鼻子和眼睛流着泪，汗水从头到脚流淌。他试图用头撞墙，挥舞着手臂，试图与他的看护人员搏斗，他呕吐、腹泻。“不要保留任何东西！让白佬走吧，宝贝！你要站得高高的，老兄！我现在可以在伊斯兰之果中看到你！”
When the awful ordeal is ended, when the grip of dope is broken, the Muslims comfort the weakex-addict, feeding him soups and broths, to get him onhis feet again. He will never forget thesebrothers who stood by him during this time. He will never forget that it was the Nation of Islam'sprogram which rescued him from the special hell of dope. And that black brother (or the sister,whom Muslim sisters attend) rarely ever will return to the use of narcotics. Instead, the ex-addictwhen he is proud, clean, renewed, can scarcely wait to hit the same junkie jungle he was in, to"fish" out some buddy and salvage _him_! 
当可怕的折磨结束时，当毒品的控制被打破时，穆斯林们安慰虚弱的前吸毒成瘾者，给他喝汤和肉汤，让他重新站起来。他永远不会忘记这些在他最困难时期陪伴他的兄弟们。他永远不会忘记是伊斯兰国家的计划将他从毒品的特别地狱中拯救出来。而这个黑人兄弟（或姐妹，由穆斯林姐妹照顾）很少会再次使用麻醉剂。相反，当自豪、干净、焕然一新的前吸毒成瘾者几乎迫不及待地回到他曾经所在的同样的吸毒者丛林中，去“钓”出一些伙伴并拯救他们！
If some white man, or "approved" black man, created a narcotics cure program as successful asthe one conducted under the aegis of the Muslims, why, there would be government subsidy, andpraise and spotlights, and headlines. But we were attacked instead. Why shouldn't the Muslimsbe subsidized to save millions of dollars a year for the government and the cities? I don't knowwhat addicts' crimes cost nationally, but it is said to be _billions_ a year in New York City. Anestimated $12 million a year is lost to thieves in Harlem alone. 
如果一些白人或“认可的”黑人创建了一个像穆斯林支持下进行的毒品治疗计划一样成功的计划，那么为什么政府会提供补贴、赞扬和关注，成为头条新闻。但我们却受到了攻击。为什么穆斯林不应该得到补贴，每年为政府和城市节省数百万美元？我不知道吸毒成瘾者的犯罪行为在全国造成了多少损失，但据说在纽约市每年高达数十亿美元。据估计，仅哈莱姆区每年就有1200万美元的财物被窃贼盗走。
An addict doesn't work to supply his habit, which may cost anywhere from ten to fifty dollars aday. How could he earn that much? No! The addict steals, he hustles in other ways; he preysupon other human beings like a hawk or a vulture-as I did. Very likely, he is a school drop-out, thesame as I was, an Army reject, psychologically unsuited to a job even if he was offered one, thesame as I was. 
一个吸毒成瘾者不会为了维持他每天花费10到50美元的习惯而工作。他怎么能赚到那么多钱呢？不！吸毒成瘾者会偷窃，他会用其他方式谋生；他会像鹰或秃鹫一样掠夺其他人——就像我曾经做过的那样。很可能，他是一个辍学的学生，和我一样，是一个被军队拒绝的人，即使他被提供了一份工作，在心理上也不适合这份工作，和我一样。
Women addicts "boost" (shoplift), or they prostitute themselves. Muslim sisters talk hard to blackprostitutes who are struggling to quit using dope in order to qualify morally to become registeredMuslims. "You are helping the white man to regard your body as a garbage can-" 
女性吸毒成瘾者会“刺激”（偷窃），或者她们会卖淫。穆斯林姐妹们对正在努力戒除毒瘾的黑人妓女进行严厉的谈话，以便在道德上符合注册穆斯林的标准。 “你正在帮助白人把你当作垃圾箱—— ”
Numerous "exposes" of the Nation of Islam have implied that Mr. Muhammad's followers werechiefly ex-cons and junkies. In the early years, yes, the converts from society's lowest levels werea sizable part of the Nation's broad base ofmembership. Always Mr. Muhammad instructed us,"Go after the black man in the mud." Often, he said, those converted made the best Muslims. 
无数关于伊斯兰国家的“揭露”暗示穆罕默德先生的追随者主要是前罪犯和吸毒成瘾者。在早期，是的，来自社会最底层的皈依者是该组织广泛的成员基础中相当大的一部分。穆罕默德先生总是指示我们：“去追求泥泞中的黑人。”他说，这些皈依者经常成为最好的穆斯林。
But gradually we recruited other black people-the "good Christians" whom we "fished" from theirchurches. Then, an increase began in the membership percentage of educated and trainedNegroes. For each rally attracted to the local temple a few more of that particular city's so-called"middle-class" Negroes, the type who previously had scoffed at us "Black Muslims" as"demagogues," and "hate-teachers," "black racists" and all the rest of the names. The Muslimtruths-listened to, thought about-reaped for us a growing quota of young black men and women.For those with training and talents, the Nation of Islam had plenty of positions where thoseabilities were needed. 
但是逐渐地，我们招募了其他黑人——那些“好基督徒”，我们从他们的教堂中“钓”出来的。然后，受过教育和训练的黑人的会员百分比开始增加。每次集会都会吸引更多该城市所谓的“中产阶级”黑人来到当地的清真寺，这些人以前曾嘲笑我们是“黑人穆斯林”，“煽动者”，“仇恨教师”，“黑人种族主义者”以及其他所有名字。听取并思考穆斯林真相为我们带来了越来越多的年轻黑人男女。对于那些有培训和才能的人，伊斯兰国家有许多需要这些能力的位置。
There were some registered Muslims who would never reveal their membership, except to otherMuslims, because of their positions in the white man's world. There were, I know, a few, whobecause of their positions were known only to their ministers and to Mr. Elijah Muhammad. 
有一些注册的穆斯林永远不会透露他们的成员身份，因为他们在白人世界中的地位。我知道有几个人，由于他们的地位，只有他们的部长和穆罕默德·伊利亚先生知道。
*     *     * 
In 1961, our Nation flourished. Our newspaper _Muhammad Speaks'_ full back page carried anarchitect's drawing of a $20 million Islamic Center proposed to be built in Chicago. Every Muslimwas making personal financial contribution toward the Center. It would include a beautifulmosque, school, library, and hospital, and a museum documenting the black man's glorioushistory. 
1961年，我们的国家繁荣昌盛。我们的报纸《穆罕默德之声》的整版广告刊登了一位建筑师设计的芝加哥伊斯兰中心的建筑图纸，价值2000万美元。每个穆斯林都为该中心的个人财务捐款。它将包括一个美丽的清真寺、学校、图书馆和医院，以及一个记录黑人光荣历史的博物馆。
Mr. Muhammad visited the Muslim countries, and upon his return he directed that we would begincalling our temples "mosques." 
穆罕默德先生访问了穆斯林国家，回来后他指示我们将开始称我们的寺庙为“清真寺”。
There was a sharp climb now, too, in the number of Muslim-owned small businesses. Ourbusinesses sought to demonstrate to the black people what black people could do forthemselves-if they would only unify, trade with each other-exclusively where possible-and hireeach other, and in so doing, keep black money within the black communities, just as otherminorities did. 
现在，穆斯林拥有的小企业数量也有了急剧的增长。我们的企业试图向黑人展示黑人可以为自己做什么事情——如果他们能够团结起来，相互交易——尽可能只与自己人交易——并相互雇佣，这样做可以让黑人的钱留在黑人社区中，就像其他少数族裔一样。
Recordings of Mr. Muhammad's speeches were now regularly being broadcast across Americaover small radio stations. In Detroit and Chicago, school-age Muslim children attended our twoUniversities of Islam-through high school in Chicago, and through junior high in Detroit. Startingfrom kindergarten, they learned of the black man's glorious history and from the third grade theystudied the black man's original language, Arabic. 
现在，穆罕默德先生的演讲录音定期通过小型广播电台在美国各地广播。在底特律和芝加哥，学龄穆斯林儿童就读于我们的两所伊斯兰大学——通过芝加哥的高中和底特律的初中。从幼儿园开始，他们学习黑人的光荣历史，从三年级开始学习黑人的原始语言阿拉伯语。
Mr. Muhammad's eight children now were all deeply involved in key capacities in the Nation ofIslam. I took a deep personal pride in having had something to do with that-at least in somecases, years before. When Mr. Muhammad had sent me out in his service as a minister, I beganto feel it was a shame that his children worked as some of them then did for the white man, infactories, construction work, driving taxis, things like that. I felt that I should work for Mr.Muhammad's family as sincerely as I worked for him. I urged Mr. Muhammad to let me put on aspecial drive within our few small mosques, to raise funds which would enable those of hischildren working for the white man to be instead employed within our Nation. Mr. Muhammadagreed, the special fund drive did prove successful, and his children gradually did begin workingfor the Nation. Emanuel, the oldest, today runs the dry-cleaning plant. Sister Ethel (Muhammad)Sharrieff is the Muslim Sisters' Supreme Instructor. (Her husband, Raymond Sharrieff, isSupreme Captain of the Fruit of Islam.) Sister Lottie Muhammad supervises the two Universitiesof Islam. Nathaniel Muhammad assists Emanuel in the dry-cleaning plant. Herbert Muhammadnow publishes _Muhammad Speaks_, the Nation's newspaper that I began. Elijah Muhammad,Jr., is the Fruit of Islam Assistant Supreme Captain. Wallace Muhammad was the PhiladelphiaMosque Minister, until finally he was suspended from the Nation along with me-for reasons I willgo into. The youngest child, Akbar Muhammad, the family student, attends the University of Cairoat El-Azhar. Akbar also has broken with his father. 
穆罕默德先生的八个孩子现在都深入参与伊斯兰国家的重要工作。我深感自豪，因为我也参与了其中——至少在一些情况下，早在几年前就开始了。当穆罕默德先生派我为他服务时，我开始感到遗憾的是他的孩子们为白人工作，在工厂、建筑工地、开出租车等工作，这样的事情。我觉得我应该像为穆罕默德先生一样真诚地为他的家人工作。我敦促穆罕默德先生让我在我们几个小清真寺里发起一项特别募捐活动，筹集资金，让他的孩子们能够在我们的国家工作。穆罕默德先生同意了，这项特别的募捐活动确实取得了成功，他的孩子们逐渐开始为这个国家工作。最大的儿子伊曼纽尔( Emanuel )现在经营着干洗厂。埃塞尔·穆罕默德( Ethel Muhammad )姐妹是穆斯林姐妹们的高级导师。（她的丈夫雷蒙德·沙利夫( Raymond Sharrieff )是伊斯兰果敢者的高级队长。）洛蒂·穆罕默德( Lottie Muhammad )姐妹负责管理两所伊斯兰大学。纳撒尼尔·穆罕默德( Nathaniel Muhammad )协助伊曼纽尔在干洗厂工作。赫伯特·穆罕默德( Herbert Muhammad )现在出版《穆罕默德之声》 ，这是由我开始出版的伊斯兰国家的报纸。小伊利亚·穆罕默德( Elijah Muhammad Jr. )是伊斯兰果敢者助理高级队长。华莱士·穆罕默德( Wallace Muhammad )曾是费城清真寺的部长，直到最后他和我都因某些原因被暂停参加该组织——我将在后面讨论这些原因。最小的孩子阿克巴·穆罕默德( Akbar Muhammad )是家里的学生，就读于开罗的爱资哈尔大学。阿克巴也与他的父亲断绝了关系。
I believe that it was too strenuous a marathon of long speeches that Mr. Muhammad made at ourbig rallies which, abruptly, badly aggravated his long-bothersome bronchial asthmatic condition. 
我相信，在大型集会上发表长篇大论的马拉松式演讲对穆罕默德先生来说太过劳累了，这突然严重加剧了他长期困扰的支气管哮喘症状。
Just in conversation, Mr. Muhammad would suddenly begin coughing, and the coughing tempowould increase until it racked his slight body. 
在谈话中，穆罕默德先生会突然开始咳嗽，咳嗽的节奏会增加，直到他瘦弱的身体被折磨得发抖。
Mr. Muhammad almost doubled up sometimes. Soon, he had to take to his bed. As hard as hetried not to, as deeply as it grieved him, he had to cancel several long-scheduled appearances atbig-city rallies. Thousands were disappointed to have to hear me instead, or other poorsubstitutes for Mr. Muhammad in person. 
穆罕默德先生有时会弯下腰来。很快，他不得不躺在床上。尽管他努力不想，但深深地感到悲痛，他不得不取消在大城市集会上的几个长期安排的露面。成千上万的人失望地听到我或其他可怜的穆罕默德先生的替身代替他发表演讲。
Members of the Nation were deeply concerned. Doctors recommended a dry climate. The Nationbought Mr. Muhammad a home in Phoenix, Arizona. One of the first times I visited Mr.Muhammad there, I stepped off a plane into flashing and whirring cameras until I wondered whowas behind me. Then I saw the cameramen's guns; they were from the Arizona IntelligenceDivision. 
国家的成员们非常担心。医生建议他去干燥的地方。国家为穆罕默德先生在亚利桑那州的凤凰城买了一所房子。我第一次去那里拜访他时，我走下飞机，闪光灯和旋转的相机围绕着我，直到我想知道谁在我身后。然后我看到了摄影师们的枪；他们来自亚利桑那州情报局。
The wire of our Nation of Islam brought all Muslims the joyful news that the Arizona climate didvastly relieve the Messenger's suffering. Since then he has spent most of each year in Phoenix.Despite the fact that Mr. Muhammad, convalescing, could no longer work the daily long hours hehad previously worked in Chicago, he was now more than ever burdened with heavy decision- making and administrative duties. In every respect, the Nation was expanded both internally andexternally. Mr. Muhammad simply could no longer allot as much time as previously to consideringand deciding which public-speaking, radio, and television requests he felt I should accept-as wellas to some organizational matters which I had always brought to him for advice or decision. 
伊斯兰国家的电报给所有穆斯林带来了令人高兴的消息，亚利桑那州的气候极大地缓解了先知的痛苦。从那时起，他每年都在凤凰城度过大部分时间。尽管康复中的穆罕默德先生不能再像以前在芝加哥那样每天长时间工作，但他现在比以往任何时候都更加背负着沉重的决策和行政责任。在各个方面，国家内部和外部都得到了扩展。穆罕默德先生根本无法像以前那样分配时间来考虑和决定他认为我应该接受的公开演讲、广播和电视请求，以及我一直向他寻求建议或决定的一些事情。
Mr. Muhammad evidenced the depth of his trust in me. In those areas I've described, he told meto make the decisions myself. He said that my guideline should be whatever I felt was wise- whatever was in the general good interests of our Nation of Islam. 
穆罕默德先生表现出他对我的信任。在我刚才描述的这些方面，他告诉我自己做出决定。他说，我的指导方针应该是我认为明智的事情——无论是否符合我们伊斯兰国家的总体利益。
"Brother Malcolm, I want you to become well known," Mr. Muhammad told me one day. "Becauseif you are well known, it will make _me_ better known," he went on. 
"马尔科姆兄弟，我希望你出名，"穆罕默德先生有一天告诉我。"因为如果你出名了，它会使我也变得更出名，"他继续说道。
"But, Brother Malcolm, there is something you need to know. You will grow to be hated when youbecome well known. Because usually people get jealo us of public figures." 
"但是，马尔科姆兄弟，有一些事情你需要知道。当你出名时，你会越来越不受欢迎。因为通常人们对公众人物感到嫉妒。"
Nothing that Mr. Muhammad ever said to me was more prophetic. 
穆罕默德先生对我说过的任何事情都没有比这更有预言性的了。
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
第十五章
ICARUS 
伊卡洛斯
The more places I represented Mr. Muhammad on television and radio, and at colleges andelsewhere, the more letters came from people who had heard me. I'd say that ninety-five per centof the letters were from white people. 
我在电视、广播和大学里代表穆罕默德先生出现得越多，我收到的来信就越多。我得说百分之九十五的信都是白人寄来的。
Only a few of the letters fell into the "Dear Nigger X" category, or the death-threats. Most of mymail exposed to me the white man's two major dreads.The first one was his own private beliefthat God wrathfully is going to destroy this civilization. And the white man's second mostpervading dread was his image of the black man entering the body of the white woman. 
只有少数几封信是"亲爱的黑鬼X"或死亡威胁之类的。我的大多数邮件暴露了白人的两个主要恐惧。第一个是他自己的私人信仰，即上帝愤怒地要摧毁这个文明。而白人的第二个最普遍的恐惧是黑人进入白人女性身体的形象。
An amazing percentage of the white letter-writers agreed entirely with Mr. Muhammad's analysisof the problem-but not with his solution. One odd ambivalence was how some letters, otherwiseall but championing Mr. Muhammad, would recoil at the expression "white devils." I tried toexplain this in subsequent speeches: 
令人惊讶的是，白人写信者中有相当一部分人完全同意穆罕默德先生对这个问题的分析，但不同意他的解决办法。一种奇怪的矛盾心理是，有些信在其他方面都支持穆罕默德先生，但却反感“白魔鬼”的说法。我后来试图在演讲中解释这一点：
"Unless we call one white man, by name, a 'devil,' we are not speaking of any _individual_ whiteman. We are speaking of the _collective_ white man's _historical_ record. We are speaking of thecollective white man's cruelties, and evils, and greeds, that have seen him _act_ like a deviltoward the non-white man. Any intelligent, honest, objective person cannot fail to realize that thiswhite man's slave trade, and his subsequent devilish actions are directly _responsible_ for notonly the _presence_ of this black man in America, but also for the _condition_ in which we findthis black man here. You cannot find _one_ black man, I do not care who he is, who has not beenpersonally damaged in some way by the devilish acts of the collective white man!" 
“除非我们点名道姓地称呼某个白人为‘魔鬼’，否则我们并不是在针对某个具体的白人。我们谈论的是整个白人群体的历史记录。我们谈论的是整个白人群体的残忍、邪恶和贪婪，他们对待非白人的行为就像魔鬼一样。任何有智慧、诚实、客观的人都不可避免地会认识到，这个白人的奴隶贸易以及随后的魔鬼行为不仅直接导致了这个黑人在美国的存在，而且也导致了我们在这里发现的这个黑人所处的状况。你找不到一个黑人，无论他是谁，没有在某种程度上受到整个白人群体魔鬼行为的个人伤害！”
Nearly every day, some attack on the "Black Muslims" would appear in some newspapers.Increasingly, a focal target was something that I had said, "Malcolm X" as a "demagogue." I wouldgrow furious reading any harsh attack upon Mr. Muhammad. I didn't care what they said aboutme. 
几乎每天，一些报纸上都会刊登攻击“黑穆斯林”的文章。越来越多的焦点目标是我曾说过的“马尔科姆·艾克斯”是一个“煽动者”。每当我看到对穆罕默德先生的严厉攻击时，我都会变得越来越愤怒。我不在乎他们对我说什么。
Those social workers and sociologists-they tried to take me apart. Especially the black ones, forsome reason. Of course, I knew the reason: the white man signed their paychecks. If I wasn't"polarizing the community," according to this bunch, I had "erroneously appraised the racialpicture." Or in some statement, Ihad "over-generalized." Or when I had made some absolutelytrue point, "Malcolm X conveniently manipulated. . . ." 
那些社会工作者和社会学者们——他们试图把我拆散。尤其是黑人，出于某种原因。当然，我知道原因：白人在给他们发工资。如果我不是“使社区两极分化”，根据这群人的说法，我就是“错误地评估了种族状况”。或者在某些陈述中，我“过度概括了”。或者当我提出一些绝对正确的观点时，“马尔科姆·艾克斯有意操纵……”
Once, one of my Mosque Seven Muslim brothers who worked with teenagers in a well-knownHarlem community center showed me a confidential report. Some black senior social worker hadbeen given a month off to investigate the "Black Muslims" in the Harlem area. Every paragraphsent me back to the dictionary-I guess that's why I've never forgotten one line about me. Listen tothis: "The dynamic interstices of the Harlem sub-culture have been oversimplified and distorted byMalcolm X to meet his own needs." 
有一次，我的第七清真寺的七位穆斯林兄弟之一，在哈莱姆社区中心与青少年一起工作的兄弟向我展示了一份机密报告。一位黑人高级社会工作者被休假一个月，以调查哈莱姆地区的“黑人穆斯林”。每个段落都让我回到了字典里——我想这就是为什么我从未忘记关于我的一句话。听这个：“马尔科姆·艾克斯为了自己的需求，过度简化和扭曲了哈莱姆亚文化的动态空隙。”
Which of us, I wonder, knew more about that Harlem ghetto "sub-culture"? I, who had hustled foryears in those streets, or that black snob status-symbol-educated social worker? 
我想知道，我们之中有谁更了解哈莱姆贫民窟的“亚文化”？是我，那些年在街头打拼的人，还是那个受过教育、自命不凡、以地位象征为荣的黑人社会工作者？
But that's not important. What's important, to my way of thinking about it, is that among America's22 million black people so relatively few have been lucky enough to attend a college-and herewas one of those who had been lucky. Here was, to my way of thinking, one of those "educated"Negroes who never had understood the true intent, or purpose, or application of education. Herewas one of those stagnant educations, never used except for parading a lot of big words. 
但这并不重要。在我看来，重要的是，在美国2200万黑人中，只有相对很少的人有幸上大学——而这个人就是其中之一。在我看来，这是那些“受过教育”的黑人之一，他们从未理解过教育的真谛、目的或应用。这是一种停滞不前的教育，除了炫耀一大堆大词之外，从未被使用过。
Do you realize this is one of the major reasons why America's white man has so easily containedand oppressed America's black man? Because until just lately, among the few educated Negroesscarcely any applied their education, as I am forced to say the white man does-in searching andcreative thinking, to 
你是否意识到，这是美国白人如此轻易地控制和压迫美国黑人的主要原因之一？因为直到最近，在少数受过教育的黑人中，几乎没有人像白人一样应用他们的教育——我不得不这样说——在探索和创造性思维方面。
further themselves and their own kind in this competitive, materialistic, dog-eat-dog white man'sworld. For generations, the so-called "educated" Negroes have "led" their black brothers byechoing the white man's thinking-which naturally has been to the exploitive white man'sadvantage. 
在这个竞争激烈、物质至上、弱肉强食的白人世界中，进一步推动他们自己和自己的种族。几代人以来，所谓的“受过教育”的黑人通过重复白人的思想来“领导”他们的黑人兄弟——这自然有利于剥削性的白人。
The white man-give him his due-has an extraordinary intelligence, an extraordinary cleverness.His world is full of proof of it. You can't name a thing the white man can't make. You can hardlyname a scientific problem he can't solve. Here he is now solving the problems of sending menexploring into outer space-and returning them safely to earth. 
白人——给他应有的赞誉——拥有非凡的智慧和聪明才智。他的世界充满了证据。你说不出白人不能制造的东西。你几乎说不出他不能解决的科学问题。现在他正在解决将人类送入外太空探索并安全返回地球的问题。
But in the arena of dealing with human beings, the white man's working intelligence is hobbled.His intelligence will fail him altogether if the humans happen to be non-white. The white man'semotions superseded his intelligence. He will commit against non-whites the most incrediblespontaneous emotional acts, so psyche-deep is his "white superiority" complex. 
但在处理人类事务的领域中，白人的工作智慧受到了限制。如果这些人碰巧是非白人，他的智力就会完全失效。白人的情绪超越了他的智力。他会对非白人做出最令人难以置信的自发情绪行为，因为他的“白色优越”情结太深了。
Where was the A-bomb dropped . . ."to save American lives"? Can the white man be so naive asto think the clear import of this ever will be lost upon the non-white two-thirds of the earth'spopulation? 
原子弹在哪里被投下……"以拯救美国人民的生命"?白人能如此天真地认为，这种明显的用意永远不会被地球上三分之二的非白人所理解吗？
Before that bomb was dropped-right over here in the United States, what about the one hundredthousand loyal naturalized and native-born Japanese-American citizens who were herded intocamps, behind barbed wire? But how many German-born naturalized Americans were herdedbehind barbed wire? They were _white_! 
在原子弹投放之前——就在美国这里，那十万忠诚的归化和本土出生的日裔美国公民被赶进了铁丝网后面的集中营，这又算什么？但是有多少德裔归化的美国人被赶进了铁丝网后面的集中营呢？他们是白人！
Historically, the non-white complexion has evoked and exposed the "devil" in the very nature ofthe white man. 
历史上，非白人的肤色唤起并暴露了白人本性中的“魔鬼”。
What else but a controlling emotional "devil" so blinded American white intelligence that it couldn'tforesee that millions of black slaves, "freed," then permitted even limited education, would oneday rise up as a terrifying monster within white America's midst?The white man's brains that today explore space should have told the slavemaster that any slave,if he is educated, will no longer fear his master. History shows that an educated slave alwaysbegins to ask, and next demand, equality with his master. 
除了一个控制情绪的“魔鬼”，还有什么能让美国白人的智力如此盲目，以至于无法预见到除了一个控制情绪的“魔鬼”，还有什么能让美国白人的智力如此盲目，以至于无法预见到数百万黑人奴隶在被“解放”后，即使接受有限的教育，也会有一天崛起成为美国白人中间一个可怕的怪物？今天探索太空的白人的大脑应该告诉奴隶主，任何受过教育的奴隶都不会再害怕他的主人。历史表明，受过教育的奴隶总是开始提问，然后要求与主人平等。
Today, in many ways the black man sees the collective white man in America better than thatwhite man can see himself. And the 22 million blacks realize increasingly that physically,politically, economically, and even to some degree socially, the aroused black man can create aturmoil in white America's vitals-not to mention America's international image. 
今天，在很多方面，黑人比白人更了解美国白人的集体形象。而2200万黑人越来越意识到，从身体上、政治上、经济上，甚至在某种程度上社会上，觉醒的黑人可以在白人美国的要害部位制造混乱——更不用说美国的国际形象了。
*     *     * 
I had not intended to stray off. I had been telling how in 1963, I was trying to cope with the whitenewspaper, radio, and television reporters who were determined to defeat Mr. Muhammad'steachings. 
我本不打算离题，我刚才在说63年时，我如何应付白报纸、电台和电视记者的穷追猛打。他们都决心要打败穆罕默德先生的教诲。
I developed a mental image of reporters as human ferrets-steadily sniffing, darting, probing forsome way to trick me, somehow to corner me in our interview exchanges. 
我在心里把记者们想象成人类用的雪貂——不停地嗅、冲、探，想找到一些办法来骗我，想方设法在采访中使我上当。
Let some civil rights "leader" make some statement, displeasing to the white public powerstructure, and the reporters, in an effort to whip him back into line, would try to use me. I'll give anexample. I'd get a question like this: "Mr. Malcolm X, you've often gone on record as disapprovingof the sit-ins and similar Negro protest actions-what is your opinion of the Montgomery boycottthat Dr. King is leading?" 
让一些民权“领袖”发表一些对白人公共权力机构不利的声明，记者们为了把他拉回到正轨上来，就会试图利用我。我来举个例子。我会得到这样一个问题：“马尔科姆· X 先生，你经常公开表示不赞成静坐示威和其他类似的黑人抗议行动——你对金博士领导的蒙哥马利抵制运动有什么看法？”
Now my feeling was that although the civil rights "leaders" kept attacking us Muslims, still theywere black people, still they were our own kind, and Iwould be most foolish to let the white manmaneuver me against the civil rights movement. 
现在我的感觉是，尽管民权“领袖”们不断攻击我们穆斯林，但他们仍然是黑人，仍然是我们自己人，如果我让白人操纵我反对民权运动，那将是最愚蠢的。
When I was asked about the Montgomery boycott, I'd carefully review what led up to it. Mrs. RosaParks was riding home on a bus and at some bus stop the white cracker bus driver ordered Mrs.Parks to get up and give her seat to some white passenger who had just got on the bus. I'd say,"Now, just _imagine_ that! This good, hard-working, Christian-believing black woman, she's paidher money, she's in her seat. Just because she's _black_, she's asked to get up! I mean,sometimes even for _me_ it's hard to believe the white man's arrogance!" 
当被问及蒙哥马利抵制运动时，我会仔细回顾导致它的原因。罗莎·帕克斯夫人在公交车上回家，在某个公交车站，白人司机命令帕克斯夫人站起来，把座位让给刚上车的白人乘客。我会说：“现在，想象一下！这个善良、勤劳、信仰基督教的黑人妇女已经付了钱，坐在自己的座位上。仅仅因为她是黑人，她就被要求站起来！我的意思是，有时候甚至对我来说也很难相信白人的傲慢！”
Or I might say, "No one will ever know exactly what emotional ingredient made this relativelytrivial incident a fuse for those Montgomery Negroes. There had been _centuries_ of the worstkind of outrages against Southern black people-lynchings, rapings, shootings, beatings! But youknow history has been triggered by trivial-seeming incidents. Once a little nobody Indian lawyerwas put off a train, and fed up with injustice, he twisted a knot in the British Lion's tail. _His_name was Mahatma Gandhi!" 
或者我可能会说：“没有人能确切知道是什么情感因素使得这个相对微不足道的事件成为了引爆蒙哥马利黑人的导火索。南方黑人遭受了数百年来最严重的暴行——私刑、强奸、枪击、殴打！但你知道，历史是由看似微不足道的事件引发的。曾经有一个不起眼的印度律师被赶出火车，他对不公正感到厌倦，于是他在英国狮子的尾巴上打了个结。他的名字是圣雄甘地！”
Or I might copy a trick I had seen lawyers use, both in life and on television. It was a way thatlawyers would slip in before a jury something otherwise inadmissable. (Sometimes I think I reallymight have made it as a lawyer, as I once told that eighth-grade teacher in Mason, Michigan, Iwanted to be, when he advised me to become a carpenter.) I would slide right over the reporter'squestion to drop into his lap a logical-extension hot potato for him. 
或者我可能会模仿我在生活和电视上看到的律师使用的技巧。这是一种律师在陪审团面前悄悄插入一些不可接受的东西的方法。（有时我想我真的可以成为一名律师，因为我曾经告诉密歇根州梅森的八年级老师，当他建议我成为一名木匠时，我想成为。）我会直接忽略记者的问题，把一个逻辑延伸的烫手山芋放在他的膝盖上。
"Well, sir, I see the same boycott reasoning for Negroes asked to join t he Army, Navy, and AirForce. Why should we go off to die somewhere to preserve a so-called 'democracy' that gives awhite immigrant of one day more than it gives the black man with four hundred years of slavingand serving in this country?" 
“嗯，先生，我看到同样的抵制理由是黑人被要求加入陆军、海军和空军。我们为什么要去某个地方死去以保护所谓的‘民主’，它给予一个白人移民的时间比给予这个国家四百年奴隶和服役的黑人的时间还要多一天？”
 Whites would prefer fifty local boycotts to having 22 million Negroes start thinking about what Ihad just said. I don't have to tell you that it never got printed the way I said it. It would be turnedinside out if it got printed at all. And I could detect when the white reporters had gotten their headstogether; they quit asking me certain questions. 
白人宁愿有50个地方的抵制，也不愿让2200万黑人开始思考我刚才所说的。我不必告诉你，它从来没有像我所说的那样被印刷出来。如果它被印刷出来，它会完全颠倒过来。当我看到白人记者们聚在一起时，我可以察觉到；他们不再问我某些问题了。
If I had developed a good point, though, I'd bait a hook to get it said when I went on radio ortelevision. I'd seem to slip and mention some recent so-called civil rights "advance." You know,where some giant industry had hired ten showpiece Negroes; some restaurant chain had begunmaking more money by serving Negroes; some Southern university had enrolled a blackfreshman without bayonets-like that. When I "slipped," the program host would leap on that bait:"Ahhh! Indeed, Mr. Malcolm X-you can't deny _that's_ an advance for your race!" 
如果我有一个好的观点，我会在上电台或电视时用一个钩子把它钓出来。我会故意说漏嘴，提到一些最近所谓的民权“进步”。例如，某个大型企业雇佣了十个黑人作为门面；某家连锁餐厅开始通过为黑人提供服务赚更多的钱；某个南方大学没有刺刀逼迫就录取了一个黑人新生——诸如此类的事情。当我“说漏嘴”时，节目主持人会抓住这个诱饵：“啊！确实如此，马尔科姆· X 先生——你不能否认那是你们种族的进步！”
I'd jerk the pole then. "I can't turn around without hearing about some 'civil rights advance'! Whitepeople seem to think the black man ought to be shouting 'hallelujah'! Four hundred years thewhite man has had his foot-long knife in the black man's back-and now the white man starts to_wiggle_ the knife out, maybe six inches! The black man's supposed to be _grateful_? W hy, if thewhite man jerked the knife _out_, it's still going to leave a _scar_!" 
然后我会猛地拉杆子。“我不能不听到一些‘民权进步’就转身离开！白人似乎认为黑人应该高呼‘哈利路亚’！四百年来，白人一直把他们一英尺长的刀插在黑人的背上——现在白人开始把刀子往外拔，也许只拔出了六英寸！黑人应该感激吗？为什么，如果白人把刀子拔出来，它仍然会留下伤疤！”
Similarly, just let some mayor or some city council somewhere boast of having "no Negroproblem." That would get off the newsroom teletypes and it would soon be jammed right in myface. I'd say they didn't need to tell me where this was, because I knew that all it meant was thatrelatively very few Negroes were living there. That's true the world over, you know. Take"democratic" England-when 100,000 black West Indians got there, England stopped the blackmigration. Finland welcomed a Negro U.S. Ambassador. Well, let enough Negroes follow him toFinland! Or in Russia, when Khrushchev was in power, he threatened to cancel the visas of blackAfrican students whose anti-discrimination demonstration said to the world, "Russia, too. . . ." 
同样地，只要让某个市长或某个市议会在某个地方吹嘘他们“没有黑人问题”。这个消息就会从新闻编辑室的电传打字机上消失，很快就会直接出现在我的脸上。我会说他们不需要告诉我这是哪里，因为我知道这仅仅意味着那里相对很少有黑人居住。你知道，这是全球普遍的情况。以“民主”的英国为例——当10万西印度黑人到达那里时，英国停止了黑人移民。芬兰欢迎一位黑人美国大使。好吧，让足够的黑人跟随他到芬兰！或者在苏联，当赫鲁晓夫掌权时，他威胁要取消反歧视示威的非洲黑人学生的签证，这些学生向世界宣告：“俄罗斯也有……”

The Deep South white press generally blacked me out. But they front-paged what I felt aboutNorthern white and black Freedom Riders going _South_ to "demonstrate." I called it "ridiculous";their own Northern ghettoes, right at home, had enough rats and roaches to kill to keep all of theFreedom Riders busy. I said that ultra-liberal New York had more integration problems thanMississippi. If the Northern Freedom Riders wanted more to do, they could work on the roots ofsuch ghetto evils as the little children out in the streets at midnight, with apartment keys on stringsaround their necks to let themselves in, and their mothers and fathers drunk, drug addicts,thieves, prostitutes. Or the Northern Freedom Riders could light some fires under Northern cityhalls, unions, and major industries to give more jobs to Negroes to remove so many of them fromthe relief and welfare rolls, which created laziness, and which deteriorated the ghettoes intosteadily worse places for humans to live. It was all-it is all-the absolute truth; but what did I wantto say it for? Snakes couldn't have turned on me faster than the liberal. 
深南地区的白人媒体通常把我屏蔽了。但是他们在头版上刊登了我对于北方白人和黑人自由骑士前往南方“示威”的看法。我称之为“荒谬”；他们自己北方的贫民窟，就在家门口，有足够的老鼠和蟑螂可以杀来让所有的自由骑士忙个不停。我说极端自由主义的纽约比密西西比有更多的种族融合问题。如果北方的自由骑士想要做更多的事情，他们可以解决这些贫民窟罪恶的根源，比如午夜时分在街上游荡的小孩子，脖子上挂着公寓钥匙让自己进去，而他们的父母则酗酒、吸毒、偷窃、卖淫。或者北方的自由骑士可以在北方市政厅、工会和主要行业之间点燃一些火焰，给黑人提供更多的工作机会，以减少他们在救济和福利名单上的人数，这创造了懒惰，使贫民窟逐渐恶化成为人类居住的更糟糕的地方。这一切都是——现在仍然是——绝对的事实；但是我为什么要说出来呢？蛇不可能比我更快地转向自由主义者。
Yes, I will pull off that liberal's halo that he spends such efforts cultivating! The North's liberalshave been for so long pointing accusing fingers at the South and getting away with it that theyhave fits when they are exposed as the world's worst hypocrites. 
是的，我会扯掉那个自由主义者花费如此多精力培养的光环！北方的自由主义者长期以来一直指责南方，并且逃脱了惩罚，当他们被揭露为世界上最虚伪的人时，他们会感到愤怒。
I believe my own life _mirrors_ this hypocrisy. I know nothing about the South. I am a creation ofthe Northern white man and of his hypocritical attitude toward the Negro. 
我相信我自己的生活反映了这种虚伪。我对南方一无所知。我是北方白人的创造物，也是他对黑人虚伪态度的产物。
The white Southerner was always given his due by Mr. Muhammad. The white Southerner, youcan say one thing-he is honest. He bares his teeth to theblack man; he tells the black man, to hisface, that Southern whites never will accept phony "integration." The Southern white goes further,to tell the black man that he means to fight him every inch of the way-against even the so-called"tokenism." The advantage of this is the Southern black man never has been under any illusionsabout the opposition he is dealing with. 
南方白人总是得到穆罕默德先生的应有尊重。南方白人，你可以说一件事——他很诚实。他对黑人露出牙齿；他当面告诉黑人，南方白人永远不会接受虚假的“融合”。南方白人更进一步，告诉黑人他打算在每一步都与他斗争——甚至反对所谓的“象征主义”。这样做的好处是南方黑人从未对他所面对的反对派产生任何幻想。
You can say for many Southern white people that, individually, they have been paternalisticallyhelpful to many individual Negroes. But the Northern white man, he grins with his teeth, and hismouth has always been full of tricks and lies of "equality" and "integration." When one day all overAmerica, a black hand touched the white man's shoulder, and the white man turned, and therestood the Negro saying "Me, too . . ." why, that Northern liberal shrank from that black man withas much guilt and dread as any Southern white man. 
对于许多南方白人来说，可以说他们个人对许多黑人个体都表现出了家长式的帮助。但是北方白人却咧着嘴笑，他的嘴里总是充满了“平等”和“融合”的诡计和谎言。当有一天整个美国，一只黑手触摸到白人的肩膀时，白人转过身来，站在那里的黑人说：“我也是……”为什么，那个北方自由主义者对这个黑人感到内疚和恐惧，就像任何一个南方白人一样。
Actually, America's most dangerous and threatening black man is the one who has been keptsealed up by the Northerner in the black ghettoes-the Northern white power structure's system tokeep talking democracy while keeping the black man out of sight somewhere, around the comer. 
事实上，美国最危险和最具威胁性的黑人是被北方人封锁在黑人贫民窟中的那个人——北方白人权力结构体系一直在谈论民主，同时将黑人隐藏在某个角落。
The word "integration" was invented by a Northern liberal. The word has no real meaning. I askyou: in the racial sense in which it's used so much today, whatever "integration" is supposed tomean, can it precisely be defined? The truth is that "integration" is an _image_, it's a foxyNorthern liberal's smokescreen that confuses the true wants of the American black man. Here inthese fifty racist and neo-racist states of North America, this word "integration" has millions ofwhite people confused, and angry, believing wrongly that the black masses want to live mixed upwith the white man. That is the case only with the relative handful of these "integration"-madNegroes. 
“融合”这个词是由一个北方自由主义者发明的。这个词没有实际意义。我问你：在今天经常使用的种族意义上，无论“融合”应该意味着什么，它能否被准确地定义？事实是“融合”是一个形象，它是一个狡猾的北方自由主义者的烟雾弹，混淆了美国黑人的真正需求。在北美这五十个种族主义和新种族主义的州中，这个单词“融合”让数百万白人感到困惑和愤怒，错误地认为黑人大众想要与白人混在一起生活。这只适用于那些疯狂的“融合”的黑人中的相对少数。
I'm talking about these "token-integrated" Negroes who flee from their poor, downtrodden blackbrothers-from their own self-hate, which is what they'rereally trying to escape. I'm talking aboutthese Negroes you will see who can't get enough of nuzzling up to the white man. These "chosenfew" Negroes are more white-minded, more anti-black, than even the white man is. 
我说的是那些“象征性融合”的黑人，他们逃离了贫穷、被压迫的黑人兄弟——逃离了他们自己的自我憎恨，这是他们真正试图逃避的东西。我说的是这些你看到的无法满足于亲近白人的黑人。这些“少数精英”黑人比白人更白人思维，更反黑人。
Human rights! Respect as _human beings_! That's what America's black masses want. That's thetrue problem. The black masses want not to be shrunk from as though they are plague-ridden.They want not to be walled up in slums, in the ghettoes, like animals. They want to live in anopen, free society where they can walk with their heads up, like men, and women! 
人权！作为人类而受到的尊重！这是美国黑人大众所想要的。这是真正的问题。黑人大众不想被缩小，好像他们被瘟疫折磨一样。他们不想被困在贫民窟和种族隔离区里，像动物一样。他们想生活在一个开放、自由的社会里，可以抬头挺胸地走路，像男人和女人一样！
Few white people realize that many black people today dislike and avoid spending any more timethan they must around white people. This "integration" image, as it is popularly interpreted, hasmillions of vain, self-exalted white people convinced that black people want to sleep in bed withthem-and that's a lie! Or you can't _tell_ the average white man that the Negro man's primedesire isn't to have a white woman-another lie! Like a black brother recently observed to me,"Look, you ever smell one of them wet?" 
很少有白人意识到，今天的许多黑人不喜欢和避免在白人周围花费比必须的时间更多的时间。这种“融合”的形象，就像通俗解释的那样，让数百万自负、自我膨胀的白人相信黑人想要和他们一起睡觉——这是一个谎言！或者你不能告诉普通的白人男子，黑人男子的主要愿望不是拥有一个白人女子——这是另一个谎言！就像一个黑人兄弟最近对我说：“你看，你闻过他们中的一个人湿漉漉的气味吗？”
The black masses prefer the company of their own kind. Why, even these fancy, bourgeoisNegroes-when they get back home from the fancy "integrated" cocktail parties, what do they dobut kick off their shoes and talk about those white liberals they just left as if the liberals weredogs. And the white liberals probably do the very same thing. I can't be sure about the whites, Iam never around them in private-but the bourgeois Negroes know I'm not lying. 
黑人大众更喜欢自己同类的陪伴。为什么，即使是这些花哨的、中产阶级的黑人——当他们从花哨的“融合”鸡尾酒会回到家里时，他们会做什么呢？除了脱掉鞋子谈论他们刚刚离开的那些白人自由主义者，好像自由主义者是狗一样。而白人自由主义者可能也会做同样的事情。我不能确定白人是否这样做，因为我从来没有私下和他们在一起——但是中产阶级的黑人知道我没有说谎。
I'm telling it like it _is_! You _never_ have to worry about me biting my tongue if something I knowas truth is on my mind. Raw, naked truth exchanged between the black man and the white man iswhat a whole lot more of is needed in this country-to clear the air of the racial mirages, clich‚s,and lies that this country's very atmosphere has been filled with for four hundred years.In many communities, especially small communities, white people have created a benevolentimage of themselves as having had so much "good-will toward our Negroes," every time any"local Negro" begins suddenly letting the local whites know the truth-that the black people are sickof being hind-tit, second-class, disfranchised, that's when you hear, uttered so sadly,"Unfortunately now because of this, our whites of good-will are starting to turn against theNegroes. . . . It's so regrettable 
我说的是事实！如果我知道真相，就不必担心我会闭口不言。黑人和白人之间交换原始的、赤裸裸的真相是这个国家所需要的更多的东西——为了清除空气中种族幻想、陈词滥调和谎言，这个国家的气氛已经被填满了四百年。在许多社区，特别是小社区，白人创造了一个仁慈的形象，他们对自己的“对我们的黑人有如此多的善意”，每次任何“当地黑人”开始突然让当地白人知道真相——黑人对被落后、二等公民、剥夺权利感到厌倦，那时你会听到，悲伤地说：“不幸的是，现在因为这一点，我们善意的白人开始反对黑人……这太令人遗憾了。”
. . . progress was being made . . . but now our communications between the races have brokendown!" 
我们种族之间的交流正在取得进展，但现在我们的种族之间的交流已经崩溃了！
What are they talking about? There never was any _communication_. Until after World War II,there wasn't a single community in the entire United States where the white man heard from anylocal Negro "leaders" the truth of what Negroes felt about the conditions that the white communityimposed upon Negroes. 
他们在谈论什么？从来没有任何交流。直到二战后，在整个美国没有一个社区，白人从任何当地黑人“领袖”那里听到过黑人对白人社区强加给黑人的条件的真实感受。
You need some proof? Well, then, why was it that when Negroes did start revolting acrossAmerica, virtually all of white America was caught up in surprise and even shock? I would hate tobe general of an army as badly informed as the American white man has been about the Negro inthis country. 
你需要一些证据吗？那么，为什么当黑人开始在美国各地反抗时，几乎所有的白人美国都感到惊讶甚至震惊呢？我很不愿意成为一支军队的将军，因为美国白人对这个国家黑人的了解是如此糟糕。
This is the situation which permitted Negro combustion to slowly build up to the revolution-point,without the white man realizing it. AH over America, the local Negro "leader," in order to surviveas a "leader," kept reassuring the local white man, in effect, "Everything's all right, everything'sright in hand, boss!" When the "leader" wanted a little something for his people: "Er, boss, someof the people talking about we sure need a better school, boss." And if the local Negroes hadn'tbeen causing any "trouble," the "benevolent" white man might nod and give them a school, orsome jobs.The white men belonging to the power structures in thousands of communities across Americaknow that I'm right! They know that I am describing what has been the true pattern of"communications" between the "local whites of good-will" and the local Negroes. It has been apattern created by domineering, ego-ridden whites. Its characteristic design permitted the whiteman to feel "noble" about throwing crumbs to the black man, instead of feeling guilty about thelocal community's system of cruelly exploiting Negroes. 
这种情况使得黑人的怒火慢慢积累到了爆发点，而白人却没有意识到。在整个美国，当地的黑人“领袖”为了生存作为“领袖”，不断向当地白人保证，实际上就是“一切都好，一切都在掌握之中，老板！”当“领袖”想要为他的人民争取一些东西时：“呃，老板，有些人说我们需要一所更好的学校，老板。”如果当地的黑人没有引起任何“麻烦”，那么“仁慈”的白人可能会点头给他们一所学校或一些工作。成千上万个社区中属于权力结构的白人知道我是对的！他们知道我说的是什么，这是“当地善意的白人”和当地黑人之间真正的交流模式。这是一种由傲慢自大的白人创造的模式。其特点设计让白人觉得自己对黑人施舍是“高尚”的，而不是对当地社区残酷剥削黑人感到内疚。
But I want to tell you something. This pattern, this "system" that the white man created, ofteaching Negroes to hide the truth from him behind a facade of grinning, "yessir-bossing," foot- shuffling and head-scratching-that system has done the American white man more harm than aninvading army would do to him. 
但我想告诉你一些事情。白人创造的这种模式，这种“系统”，经常教导黑人在微笑、“是的老板”的表面下向他隐藏真相，踱步和挠头——这个系统对美国白人造成的伤害比入侵的军队还要多。
Why do I say this? Because all this has steadily helped this American white man to build up, deepin his psyche, absolute conviction that he _is_ "superior." In how many, many communities have,thus, white men who didn't finish high school regarded condescendingly university-educated localNegro "leaders," principals of schools, teachers, doctors, other professionals? 
我为什么这么说？因为所有这些都稳定地帮助这个美国白人在他的内心深处建立起绝对的确信，他确实是“优越的”。因此，在许多社区中，没有完成高中教育的白人轻视大学教育背景的当地黑人“领袖”，学校校长、教师、医生和其他专业人士。
The white man's system has been imposed upon non-white peoples all over the world. This isexactly the reason why wherever people who are anything but white live in this world today, thewhite man's governments are finding themselves in deeper and deeper trouble and peril. 
白人的制度已经被强加于全世界的非白人。这就是为什么今天，除了白人以外的任何人生活在这个世上，白人政府的政府都发现自己越来越陷入更深的麻烦和危险之中。
Let's just face truth. Facts! Whether or not the white man of the world is able to face truth, andfacts, about the true reasons for his troubles-that's what essentially will determine whether or nothe will now survive. 
让我们面对现实吧。事实！世界上的白人是否能够面对真相和事实，关于他的麻烦的真正原因，这基本上将决定他现在是否能活下来。
Today we are seeing this revolution of the non-white peoples, who just a few years ago wouldhave frozen in horror if the mighty white nations so much aslifted an eyebrow. What it is, simply, isthat black and brown and red and yellow peoples have, after hundreds of years of exploitationand imposed "inferiority" and general misuse, become, finally, do-or-die sick and tired of the whiteman's heel on their necks. 
今天，我们正在看到非白人民族的革命，仅仅几年前，如果强大的白人国家稍微挑起眉头，他们就会惊恐地冻结。简单地说，黑人、棕色人种、红色人和黄色人种在数百年的剥削和强加的“劣等”和普遍滥用之后，最终变得生死攸关地厌倦了白人踩在他们脖子上的脚跟。
How can the white American government figure on selling "democracy" and "brotherhood" to non- white peoples-if they read and hear every day what's going on right here in America, and see thebetter-than-a-thousand-words photographs of the American white man denying "democracy" and"brotherhood" even to America's native-born non-whites? The world's non-whites know how thisNegro here has loved the American white man, and slaved for him, tended to him, nursed him.This Negro has jumped into uniform and gone off and died when this America was attacked byenemies both white and non-white. Such a faithful, loyal non-white as _this_-and _still_ Americabombs him, and sets dogs on him, and turns fire hoses on him, and jails him by the thousands,and beats him bloody, and inflicts upon him all manner of other crimes. 
美国白人政府如何能够向非白人推销“民主”和“兄弟情谊”，如果他们每天阅读和听到在美国发生的事情，看到美国白人否认甚至对美国本土的非白人实行“民主”和“兄弟情谊”的照片，这些照片胜过千言万语？世界上的非白人知道这个黑人是多么爱美国白人，为他工作，照顾他，护理他。当美国受到白人和非白人敌人的攻击时，这个黑人穿上军装去战斗并牺牲了。这样一个忠诚的非白人——而美国仍然对他进行轰炸，放狗咬他，用消防水龙带喷他，将他关进监狱数千人，打得他血肉模糊，还对他施加各种其他罪行。
Of course these things, known and refreshed every day for the rest of the world's non-whites, area vital factor in these burnings of ambassadors' limousines, these stonings, defilings, andwreckings of embassies and legations, these shouts of 
当然，对于世界其他非白人来说，这些事情是众所周知的，每天都会被刷新。这些燃烧大使轿车、这些对大使馆和领事馆的破坏和污损以及这些呐喊声中的一个重要因素是：
"White man, go home!" these attacks on white Christian missionaries, and these bombings andtearing down of flags. 
这些攻击白人基督教传教士的事件，以及这些炸弹袭击和降旗的行为中的一个重要因素是：“白人，回家！”
Is it clear why I have said that the American white man's malignant superiority complex has donehim more harm than an invading army? 
我为什么说美国白人的恶性优越感对他造成的伤害比入侵的军队还要多，原因很明显吗？
*     *     * 
The American black man should be focusing his every effort toward buildinghis _own_businesses, and decent homes for himself. As other ethnic groups have done, let the blackpeople, wherever possible, however possible, patronize their own kind, hire their own kind, andstart in those ways to build up the black race's ability to do for itself. That's the only way theAmerican black man is ever going to get respect. One thing the white man never can give theblack man is self-respect! The black man never can become independent and recognized as ahuman being who is truly equal with other human beings until he has what they have, and until heis doing for himself what others are doing for themselves. 
美国黑人应该把每一份努力都集中在建立自己的企业和为自己建造体面的住房上。就像其他种族群体一样，让黑人无论在何处、如何可能，支持自己的同类，雇佣自己的同类，并从这些方面开始建立起黑人自我发展的能力。这是美国黑人获得尊重的唯一途径。白人永远无法给予黑人的是自尊！黑人永远不会成为独立的人，并被认可为与其他人类真正平等的人，直到他拥有其他人所拥有的东西，直到他为自己做的事情与其他人为自己做的事情相同。
The black man in the ghettoes, for instance, has to start self-correcting his own material, moral,and spiritual defects and evils. The black man needs to start his own program to get rid ofdrunkenness, drug addiction, prostitution. The black man in America has to lift up his own senseof values. 
例如，在贫民窟中的黑人必须开始自我纠正自己的物质、道德和精神上的缺陷和邪恶。黑人需要开始自己的计划来摆脱酗酒、吸毒和卖淫。美国的黑人必须提高自己的价值观。
Only a few thousands of Negroes, relatively a very tiny number, are taking any part in"integration." Here, again, it is those few bourgeois Negroes, rushing to throw away their littlemoney in the white man's luxury hotels, his swanky nightclubs, and big, fine, exclusiverestaurants. The white people patronizing those places can afford it. But these Negroes you seein those places can't afford it, certainly most of them can't. Why, what does some Negro oneinstallment payment away from disaster look like somewhere downtown out to dine, grinning atsome headwaiter who has more money than the Negro? Those bourgeois Negroes out drapingbig tablecloth-sized napkins over their knees and ordering quail under glass and stewed snails- why, Negroes don't even _like_ snails! What they're doing is proving they're integrated. 
只有几千名黑人，相对来说是一个非常小的数字，正在参与“融合”。在这里，又是那些少数资产阶级黑人，急于在白人的豪华酒店、时髦的夜总会和大型、精美、高档的餐厅中扔掉他们的小钱。白人光顾这些地方是负担得起的。但是这些你在那些地方看到的黑人买不起，当然他们中的大多数也买不起。为什么，一些黑人离灾难只有一步之遥，他们在市中心外出就餐时会是什么样子？他们会对一些比黑人还有钱的领班服务员咧嘴笑吗？那些资产阶级黑人在外面用桌布大小的餐巾盖住膝盖，点玻璃下的鹌鹑和炖蜗牛——为什么，黑人甚至不喜欢蜗牛！他们所做的就是证明他们已经融入了社会。
If you want to get right down to the real outcome of this so-called "integration," what you've got toarrive at is intermarriage. 
如果你想得到这个所谓的“融合”的真正结果，你必须达到的是异族通婚。
I'm right _with_ the Southern white man who believes that you can't haveso-called "integration,"at least not for long, without intermarriage increasing. And what good is this for anyone? Let'sagain face reality. In a world as color-hostile as this, man or woman, black or white, what do theywant with a mate of the other race? 
我和南方白人的观点一致，他们认为如果没有异族通婚的增加，你就不能有所谓的“融合”，至少不能长久地维持。这对任何人有什么好处呢？让我们再次面对现实。在一个如此充满种族仇恨的世界中，无论男人还是女人，黑人还是白人，他们想要和另一个种族的人作为伴侣吗？
Certainly white people have served enough notice of their hostility to any blacks in their familiesand neighborhoods. And the way most Negroes feel today, a mixed couple probably finds thatblack families, black communities, are even more hostile than the white ones. So what's bound toface "integrated" marriages, except being unwelcomed, unwanted, "misfits" in whichever worldthey try to live in? What we arrive at is that "integration," socially, is no good for either side."Integration," ultimately, would destroy the white race . . . and destroy the black race. 
当然，白人已经充分表达了他们对家庭和社区中任何黑人的敌意。大多数黑人今天感受到的方式是，一对混合夫妻可能会发现黑人家庭、黑人社区甚至比白人家庭更加敌对。因此，除了在无论他们尝试生活的世界中不受欢迎、不需要的“不合适的人”之外，什么必然会面对“融合”的婚姻呢？我们得出的结论是，在社会上，“融合”对任何一方都没有好处。最终，“融合”将摧毁白人种族……也会摧毁黑人种族。
The white man's "integrating" with black women has already changed the complexion andcharacteristics of the black race in America. What's been proved by the "blacks" whosecomplexions are "whiter" than many "white" people? I'm told that there are in America todaybetween two and five million "white Negroes," who are "passing" in white society. Imagine theirtorture! Living in constant fear that some black person they've known might meet and exposethem. Imagine every day living a lie. _Imagine_ hearing their own white husbands, their ownwhite wives, even their own white children, talking about "those Negroes." 
白人与黑人女性的“融合”已经改变了美国黑人的肤色和特征。那些肤色比许多白人还要“白”的“黑人”证明了什么？我被告知，今天在美国有两百万到五百万的“白人黑人”，他们在白人社会中“混入”。想象一下他们的痛苦！生活在持续的恐惧中，担心他们认识的某个黑人可能会遇到并揭露他们。想象每天生活在谎言中。想象听到自己的白人丈夫、白人妻子甚至自己的白人孩子谈论“那些黑人”。
I would doubt if anyone in America has heard Negroes more bitter against the white man thansome of those I have heard. But I will tell you that, without any question, the _most_ bitter anti- white diatribes that I have ever heard have come from "passing" Negroes, living as whites,among whites, exposed every day to what white people say among themselves regardingNegroes-things that a recognized Negro never would hear. Why, if there was a racialshowdown,these Negroes "passing" within white circles would become the black side's mostvaluable "spy" and ally. 
我怀疑在美国是否有人听到过比我曾经听到过的黑人更苦于白人的人。但是我会告诉你，毫无疑问，我所听过的最苦涩的反白人抨击来自于“混入”白人社会的黑人，他们生活在白人中间，每天都暴露在白人之间关于黑人的言论中——这些事情是公认的黑人永远不会听到的。为什么，如果有一个种族摊牌，这些在白人圈子里“混入”的黑人将成为黑人方最有价值的“间谍”和盟友。
Europe's "brown babies," now young men and women who are starting to marry, and producefamilies of their own . . . have their experiences throughout their lives, scarred as racial freaks,proved anything positive for "integration"? 
欧洲的“棕色婴儿”，现在开始结婚并组建自己的家庭的男女青年……他们一生中的经历，作为种族怪物留下的伤痕，证明了“融合”有任何积极意义吗？
"Integration" is called "assimilation" if white ethnic groups alone are involved: it's fought againsttooth and nail by those who want their heritage preserved. Look at how the Irish threw the Englishout of Ireland. The Irish knew the English would engulf them. Look at the French-Canadians,fanatically fighting to keep their identity. 
如果只有白人种族群体参与，“融合”被称为“同化”：这是那些希望保留自己遗产的人拼死抵抗的。看看爱尔兰人是如何把英国人赶出爱尔兰的。爱尔兰人知道英国人会吞并他们。看看法裔加拿大人，狂热地为保持自己的身份而战。
In fact, history's most tragic result of a mixed, therefore diluted and weakened, ethnic identity hasbeen experienced by a white ethnic group-the Jew in Germany. 
事实上，历史上最悲惨的结果之一就是种族身份的混合、稀释和削弱，这已经在德国的白人种族群体犹太人身上得到了体现。
He had made greater contributions to Germany than Germans themselves had. Jews had wonover half of Germany's Nobel Prizes. Every culture in Germany was led by the Jew; he publishedthe greatest newspaper. Jews were the greatest artists, the greatest poets, composers, stagedirectors. But those Jews made a fatal mistake-assimilating. 
他为德国做出的贡献比德国人自己还要大。犹太人赢得了德国一半以上的诺贝尔奖。德国的每一种文化都由犹太人领导；他出版了最好的报纸。犹太人是最伟大的艺术家、最伟大的诗人、作曲家和舞台导演。但是那些犹太人犯了一个致命的错误——同化。
From World War I to Hitler's rise, the Jews in Germany had been increasingly intermarrying. Manychanged their names and many took other religions. Their own Jewish religion, their own richJewish ethnic and cultural roots, they anesthetized, and cut off. . . until they began thinking ofthemselves as "Germans." And the next thing they knew, there was Hitler, rising to power fromthe beer halls-with his emotional "Aryan master race" theory. And right at hand for a scapegoatwas the self-weakened, self-deluded "German" Jew. 
从第一次世界大战到希特勒的崛起，德国的犹太人越来越多地与异族通婚。许多人改了名字，许多人信仰其他宗教。他们自己的犹太教、自己丰富的犹太种族和文化根源，他们麻醉了自己，切断了……直到他们开始认为自己是“德国人”。而接下来他们所知道的就是希特勒在啤酒厅里崛起掌权——带着他充满情感的“雅利安人种优越论”。而眼前正好有一个替罪羊，那就是自我削弱、自我欺骗的“德国”犹太人。
 Most mysterious is how did those Jews-with all of their brilliant minds, with all of their power inevery aspect of Germany's affairs-how did those Jews stand almost as if mesmerized, watchingsomething which did not spring upon them overnight, but which was gradually developed-amonstrous plan for their own _murder_. 
最神秘的是，那些犹太人——拥有所有聪明才智、在德国事务的每个方面都拥有无限力量最神秘的是，那些犹太人——拥有所有聪明才智、在德国事务的每个方面都拥有无限力量——他们是如何几乎像被催眠一样，眼睁睁地看着一个不是一夜之间突然降临，而是逐渐发展出来的可怕计划——针对他们自己的计划。
Their self-brainwashing had been so complete that not long after, in the gas chambers, a lot ofthem were still gasping, "It can't be true!" 
他们的自我洗脑是如此彻底，以至于在毒气室不久之后，他们中的许多人仍然喘着气说：“不可能是真的！”
If Hitler had conquered the world, as he meant to-that is a shuddery thought for every Jew alivetoday. 
如果希特勒征服了世界，就像他打算的那样——这对今天每个活着的犹太人来说都是一个令人不寒而栗的想法。
The Jew never will forget that lesson. Jewish intelligence eyes watch every neo-Naziorganization. Right after the war, the Jews' Haganah mediating body stepped up the longtimenegotiations with the British. But this time, the Stern gang was shooting the British. And this timethe British acquiesced and helped them to wrest Palestine away from the Arabs, the rightfulowners, and then the Jews set up Israel, their own country-the one thing that every race of man inthe world respects, and understands. 
犹太人永远不会忘记这个教训。犹太情报机构监视着每一个新纳粹组织。就在战争结束后，犹太人的哈加纳调解机构加强了与英国的长期谈判。但这一次，斯特恩帮的目标是英国人。这一次，英国人默许并帮助他们从阿拉伯人手中夺取了巴勒斯坦，然后犹太人建立了以色列，他们自己的国家——这是世界上每个种族都尊重和理解的一件事。
*     *     * 
Not long ago, the black man in America was fed a dose of another form of the weakening, lullingand deluding effects of so-called "integration." It was that "Farce on Washington," I call it. 
不久前，美国黑人被灌输了另一种形式的弱化、安抚和欺骗效应，即所谓的“融合”。我称之为“华盛顿闹剧”。
The idea of a mass of blacks marching on Washington was originally the brainchild of theBrotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters' A. Philip Randolph. For twenty or more years the March onWashington idea had floated around among Negroes. And, spontaneously, suddenly now, thatidea caught on. 
黑人大规模游行到华盛顿的想法最初是由卧铺车搬运工工会的A.菲利普·伦道夫提出的。二十多年来，这个想法一直在黑人中间流传。现在，这个想法突然自发地流行起来。
 Overalled rural Southern Negroes, small town Negroes, Northern ghetto Negroes, eventhousands of previously Uncle Tom Negroes began talking "March!" 
南方农村黑人、小城镇黑人、北方贫民窟黑人，甚至成千上万以前是汤姆叔叔的黑人开始谈论“游行！”
Nothing since Joe Louis had so coalesced the masses of Negroes. Groups of Negroes weretalking of getting to Washington any way they could-in rickety old cars, on buses, hitch-hiking- walking, even, if they had to. They envisioned thousands of black brothers converging togetherupon Washington-to lie down in the streets, on airport runways, on government lawns-demandingof the Congress and the White House some concrete civil rights action. 
自乔·路易斯以来，没有什么能如此凝聚黑人群众。一群群黑人谈论着如何以任何方式到达华盛顿——乘坐破旧的旧车、公共汽车、搭便车——步行，即使他们必须这样做。他们想象着成千上万的黑人兄弟聚集在华盛顿——躺在街道上、机场跑道上、政府草坪上——要求国会和白宫采取一些具体的民权行动。
This was a national bitterness; militant, unorganized, and leaderless. Predominantly, it was youngNegroes, defiant of whatever might be the consequences, sick and tired of the black man's neckunder the white man's heel. 
这是全国性的苦闷，是好斗的、无组织的和没有领导的。主要是年轻的黑人，他们不顾一切后果，对黑人在白人脚下受屈辱感到厌倦。
The white man had plenty of good reasons for nervous worry. The right spark-some unpredictableemotional chemistry-could set off a black uprising. The government knew that thousands ofmilling, angry blacks not only could completely disrupt Washington-but they could erupt inWashington. 
白人有很多理由感到紧张和担忧。正确的火花——一些不可预测的情感化学反应——可能会引发黑人起义。政府知道，成千上万的愤怒的黑人不仅会完全扰乱华盛顿，而且会在华盛顿爆发。
The White House speedily invited in the major civil rights Negro "leaders." They were asked tostop the planned March. They truthfully said they hadn't begun it, they had no control over it-theidea was national, spontaneous, unorganized, and leaderless. In other words, it was a blackpowder keg. 
白宫迅速邀请了主要的民权黑人“领袖”。他们被要求停止计划中的游行。他们诚实地说，他们没有开始，他们无法控制它——这个想法是全国性的、自发的、无组织的和没有领导的。换句话说，这是一个火药桶。
Any student of how "integration" can weaken the black man's movement was about to observe amaster lesson. 
任何研究“融合”如何削弱黑人运动的人都要观察一堂大师课。
The White House, with a fanfare of international publicity, "approved," "endorsed," and"welcomed" a March on Washington. The big civil rights organizations right at this time had beenpublicly squabbling about donations.The _New York Times_ had broken the story. The N.A.A.C.P.had charged that other agencies' demonstrations, highly publicized, had attracted a major part ofthe civil rights donations-while the N.A.A.C.P. got left holding the bag, supplying costly bail andlegal talent for the other organizations' jailed demonstrators. 
白宫在国际舆论的喧嚣中“批准”、“支持”和“欢迎”了一次华盛顿游行。此时，大型民权组织正公开争吵着捐款事宜。
It was like a movie. The next scene was the "big six" civil rights Negro "leaders" meeting in NewYork City with the white head of a big philanthropic agency. They were told that their money- wrangling in public was damaging their image. And a reported $800,000 was donated to a UnitedCivil Rights Leadership council that was quickly organized by the "big six." 
就像电影一样。下一幕是“六大”民权黑人“领袖”在纽约市与一家大型慈善机构的白人负责人会面。他们被告知，他们在公开场合争夺钱财的行为有损形象。据报道，80万美元捐给了由“六大”迅速组织的联合民权领导委员会。
Now, what had instantly achieved black unity? The white man's money. What string was attachedto the money? Advice. Not only was there this donation, but another comparable sum waspromised, for sometime later on, after the March .  . . obviously if all went well. 
现在，是什么立刻实现了黑人的团结？白人的钱。钱附带了什么条件？建议。不仅有这笔捐款，而且还有一笔类似的款项承诺在游行后的某个时候支付，显然，如果一切顺利的话。
The original "angry" March on Washington was now about to be entirely changed. 
最初的“愤怒”的华盛顿游行现在即将完全改变。
Massive international publicity projected the "big six" as March on Washington leaders. It wasnews to those angry grassroots Negroes steadily adding steam to their March plans. Theyprobably assumed that now those famous "leaders" were endorsing and joining them. 
大量的国际宣传将“六大”塑造成华盛顿游行的领导者。对于那些愤怒的基层黑人，这是他们为游行计划不断增加动力的新闻。他们可能认为现在那些著名的“领袖”正在支持并加入他们。
Invited next to join the March were four famous white public figures: one Catholic, one Jew, oneProtestant, and one labor boss. 
接下来被邀请参加游行的有四位著名的白人公众人物：一位天主教徒、一位犹太人、一位新教徒和一位劳工领袖。
The massive publicity now gently hinted that the "big ten" would "supervise" the March onWashington's "mood," and its "direction." 
大量的宣传现在温和地暗示，“十大”将“监督”华盛顿游行的“情绪”和“方向”。
 The four white figures began nodding. The word spread fast among so-called "liberal" Catholics,Jews, Protestants, and laborites: it was "democratic" to join this black March. 
这四位白人开始点头。这个信息在所谓的“自由派”天主教徒、犹太人、新教徒和劳工党人中迅速传播：加入这场黑人游行是“民主的”。
And suddenly, the previously March-nervous whites began announcing _they_ were going. 
突然，之前对游行感到紧张的白人开始宣布他们也要参加。
It was as if electrical current shot through the ranks of bourgeois Negroes-the very so-called"middle-class" and "upper-class" who had earlier been deploring the March on Washington talk bygrass-roots Negroes. But white people, now, were going to march. Why, some downtrodden,jobless , hungry Negro might have gotten trampled. Those "integration"-mad Negroes practicallyran over each other trying to find out where to sign up. The "angry blacks" March suddenly hadbeen made chic. Suddenly it had a Kentucky Derby image. For the status-seeker, it was a statussymbol. "Were you _there_?" You can hear that right today. 
仿佛电流穿过了资产阶级黑人的队伍——那些所谓的“中产阶级”和“上层阶级”，他们早些时候曾对草根黑人谈论华盛顿游行感到惋惜。但现在，白人要参加游行了。为什么？一些被压迫、失业、饥饿的黑人可能会被踩死。那些“融合”疯狂的黑人几乎互相践踏，试图找出在哪里报名。“愤怒的黑人”游行突然变得时髦起来。突然间，它有了肯塔基德比的形象。对于追求地位的人来说，这是一种地位象征。“你在那里吗？”你现在就可以听到这句话。
It had become an outing, a picnic. 
它变成了一次郊游，一次野餐。
The morning of the March, any rickety carloads of angry, dusty, sweating small-town Negroeswould have gotten lost among the chartered jet planes, railroad cars, and air-conditioned buses.What originally was planned to be an angry riptide, one English newspaper aptly described nowas "the gentle flood." Talk about "integrated"! It was like salt and pepper. And, by now, therewasn't a single logistics aspect uncontrolled. 
游行当天早上，任何一辆摇摇晃晃的破旧小车里愤怒、灰尘满面、汗流浃背的小镇黑人都会被包租的喷气式飞机、火车车厢和空调巴士淹没。最初计划的愤怒的浪潮，现在被一家英国报纸恰当地描述为“温和的洪水”。说到“融合”！就像盐和胡椒一样。而且，到目前为止，没有一个后勤方面是失控的。
The marchers had been instructed to bring no signs-signs were provided. They had been told tosing one song: "We Shall Overcome." They had been told _how_ to arrive, _when_, _where_ toarrive, _where_ to assemble, when to _start_ marching, the _route_ to march. First-aid stationswere strategically located-even where to _faint_!Yes, I was there. I observed that circus. Who ever heard of angry revolutionists all harmonizing"We Shall Overcome . . . Suum Day . . ." while tripping and swaying along arm-in-arm with thevery people they were supposed to be angrily revolting against? Who ever heard of angryrevolutionists swinging their bare feet together with their oppressor in lily-pad park pools, withgospels and guitars and "I Have, A Dream" speeches? 
游行者被指示不要带标语——标语已经准备好了。他们被告知唱一首歌：“我们将克服。”他们被告知如何到达、何时到达、在哪里集合、什么时候开始游行、游行路线。急救站被战略性地布置好了——甚至还有晕倒的地方！是的，我在那里。我观察了这场表演。有谁听说过愤怒的革命者在与他们应该愤怒反抗的人一起跳舞和摇摆时，和谐地唱着“我们将克服……Suum Day……？”？有谁听说过愤怒的革命者在百合花公园的游泳池里，用福音书和吉他和“我有一个梦想”演讲，与他们的压迫者一起摇摆赤裸的脚？
And the black masses in America were-and still are-having a nightmare. 
而美国的黑人群众曾经——现在也是——正在经历一场噩梦。
These "angry revolutionists" even followed their final instructions: to leave early. With all of thosethousands upon thousands of "angry revolutionists," so few stayed over that the next morning theWashington hotel association reported a costly loss in empty rooms. 
这些“愤怒的革命者”甚至遵循了他们的最后指示：提前离开。在成千上万的“愤怒的革命者”中，只有很少一部分留下来，以至于第二天早上华盛顿酒店协会报告说空房间造成了巨大的损失。
Hollywood couldn't have topped it. 
好莱坞电影也不过如此。
In a subsequent press poll, not one Congressman or Senator with a previous record of oppositionto civil rights said he had changed his views. What did anyone expect? How was a one-day"integrated" picnic going to counter-influence these representatives of prejudice rooted deep inthe psyche of the American white man for four hundred years? 
在随后的媒体民意调查中，没有一个以前反对民权的国会议员或参议员表示改变了他们的观点。任何人期望什么？一天的“融合”野餐如何能对抗这些根深蒂固的偏见代表，这些偏见已经根植于美国白人的心理长达400年之久？
The very fact that millions, black and white, believed in this monumental farce is another exampleof how much this country goes in for the surface glossing over, the escape ruse, surfaces, insteadof truly dealing with its deep-rooted problems. 
数百万黑人和白人相信这个巨大的骗局，这一事实再次表明这个国家在表面光泽上投入了多少，逃避的诡计，表面，而不是真正解决其根深蒂固的问题。
What that March on Washington did do was lull Negroes for a while. But inevitably, the blackmasses started realizing they had been smoothly hoaxed again by the white man. And, inevitably,the black man's anger rekindled, deeperthan ever, and there began bursting out in different cities,in the "long, hot summer" of 1964, unprecedented racial crises. 
那次华盛顿游行确实让黑人安静了一段时间。但不可避免地，黑人开始意识到他们再次被白人顺利地欺骗了。而且，不可避免的是，黑人的愤怒比以往任何时候都更加深刻，在1964年的“漫长而炎热的夏天”，不同的城市开始爆发前所未有的种族危机。

About a month before the "Farce on Washington," the _New York Times_ reported me, accordingto its poll conducted on college and university campuses, as "the second most sought after"speaker at colleges and universities. The only speaker ahead of me was Senator BarryGoldwater. 
大约在“华盛顿闹剧”发生前一个月， 《纽约时报》根据其在高校校园进行的民意
I believe that what had generated such college popularity for me was Dr. Lincoln's book, _TheBlack Muslims in America_. It had been made required reading in numerous college courses.Then a long, candid interview with me was carried by _Playboy_ magazine, whose circulation oncollege campuses is the biggest of any magazine's. And many students, having studied first thebook and then the _Playboy_ interview, wanted to hear in person this so-called "fiery BlackMuslim." 
我相信，让我在大学里如此受欢迎的原因是林肯博士的书《美国黑人穆斯林》。这本书已经被许多大学的必读书目所采用。然后， 《花花公子》杂志对我进行了一次长时间的坦率采访，该杂志在大学校园中的发行量是任何其他杂志中最大的。许多学生在学习了这本书和《花花公子》的采访后，都想亲自听听这个所谓的“热情洋溢的黑人穆斯林”的声音。
When the _New York Times_ poll was published, I had spoken at well over fifty colleges anduniversities, like Brown, Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Rutgers, in the Ivy League, and othersthroughout the country. Right now, I have invitations from Cornell, Princeton and probably adozen others, as soon as my time and their available dates can be scheduled together. AmongNegro institutions, I had then been to Atlanta University and Clark 
当《纽约时报》的民意调查结果公布时，我已经在布朗大学、哈佛大学、耶鲁大学、哥伦比亚大学和拉特格斯大学等常春藤联盟的大学以及其他全国各地的大学演讲了50多次。目前，我收到了康奈尔大学、普林斯顿大学和其他十几个大学的邀请，只要我的时间和他们可用的日期能够安排在一起。在黑人机构中，我当时已经去过亚特兰大大学和克拉克
College down in Atlanta, to Howard University in Washington, D.C., and to a number of otherswith small student bodies. 
从亚特兰大的大学到华盛顿特区的霍华德大学，再到其他一些学生人数较少的大学。
Except for all-black audiences, I liked the college audiences best. The college sessionssometimes ran two to four hours-they often ran overtime. Challenges, queries, and criticismswere fired at me by the usually objective and alwaysalive and searching minds of undergraduateand graduate students, and their faculties. The college sessions never failed to be exhilarating.They never failed in helping me to further my own education. I never experienced one collegesession that didn't show me ways to improve upon my presentation and defense of Mr.Muhammad's teachings. Sometimes in a panel or debate appearance, I'd find a jam-packedaudience to hear me, alone, facing six or eight student and faculty scholars-heads of departmentssuch as sociology, psychology, philosophy, history, and religion, and each of them coming at mein his specialty. 
除了全是黑人的观众外，我最喜欢大学观众。大学的演讲有时会持续两到四个小时——经常会超时。挑战、质疑和批评来自通常客观、总是充满生气和探索精神的本科生和研究生以及他们的教师。大学的演讲总是令人兴奋不已。它们总能帮助我进一步提高自己的教育水平。我从未经历过一场大学演讲没有向我展示如何改进我对穆罕默德先生的教导的陈述和辩护。有时在小组讨论或辩论中，我会找到一个挤满人的观众来听我独自面对六到八个学生和教职学者——如社会学、心理学、哲学、历史和宗教等系的系主任，每个人都以他的专长来对付我。
At the outset, always I'd confront such panels with something such as: "Gentlemen, I finished theeighth grade in Mason, Michigan. My high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury,Massachusetts. My college was in the streets of Harlem, and my master's was taken in prison.Mr. Muhammad has taught me that I never need fear any man's intellect who tries to defend or tojustify the white man's criminal record against the non-white man-especially the white man andthe black man here in North America." 
一开始，我总是面对这样的小组讨论会说：“先生们，我在密歇根州的梅森完成了八年级。我的高中是在马萨诸塞州罗克斯伯里市的黑人贫民窟。我的大学是在哈莱姆区的街道上完成的，而我硕士学位是在监狱里获得的。穆罕默德先生教导我，我永远不需要害怕任何试图为白人对非白人——尤其是北美的白人和黑人——的犯罪记录辩护或辩解的人的智慧。”
It was like being on a battlefield-with intellectual and philosophical bullets. It was an excitingbattling with ideas. I got so I could feel my audiences' temperaments. I've talked with other publicspeakers; they agree that this ability is native to any person who has the "mass appeal" gift, whocan get through to and move people. It's a psychic radar. As a doctor, with his finger against apulse, is able to feel the heart rate, when I am up there speaking, I can _feel_ the reaction to whatI am saying.I think I could be speaking blindfolded and after five minutes, I could tell you if sitting out therebefore me was an all-black or an all-white audience. Black audiences and white audiences feeldistinguishably different. Black audiences feel warmer, there is almost a musical rhythm, for me,even in their silent response.Question-and-answer periods are another area where, by now, again blindfolded, I can often tellyou the ethnic source of a  question. The most easily recognizable of these to me are a Jew inany audience situation, and a bourgeois Negro in "integrated" audiences. 
这就像在战场上——用知识和哲学的子弹。这是一场激动人心的思想斗争。我变得可以感受到我的观众的情绪。我和其他公众演讲者交谈过；他们同意这种能力是天生的，任何具有“大众吸引力”天赋的人都可以与人们产生共鸣并感动他们。这是一种心理雷达。当医生用手指按压脉搏时，能够感受到心率，当我在那里讲话时，我可以感受到对我所说的话的反应。我想我可以在蒙着眼睛的情况下说话，五分钟后，我可以告诉你坐在我前面的是全黑人还是全白人的观众。黑人观众和白人观众的感觉明显不同。黑人观众感觉更温暖，几乎有一种音乐节奏，对我来说，即使是他们的沉默反应也是如此。问答环节是另一个领域，现在，再次蒙上眼睛，我经常可以告诉你一个问题的民族来源。最容易被我认出的是在任何观众情况下的犹太人和一个“融合”的观众中的资产阶级黑人。
My clue to the Jew's question and challenges is that among all other ethnic groups, his expressedthinking, his expressed concerns, are the most subjective. And the Jew is usually hypersensitive.I mean, you can't even say "Jew" without him accusing you of anti-Semitism. I don't care what aJew is professionally, doctor, merchant, housewife, student, or whatever-first he, or she, thinksJew. 
我对犹太人的问题和挑战的线索是，在所有其他种族群体中，他表达的思想、他表达的担忧是最主观的。而且犹太人通常非常敏感。我的意思是，你甚至不能说“犹太人”而不被他指控为反犹太主义。我不在乎一个犹太人的职业是什么，医生、商人、家庭主妇、学生或其他什么——首先，他或她认为自己是犹太人。
Now, of course I can understand the Jew's hypersensitivity. For two thousand years, religious andpersonal prejudices against Jews have been vented and exercised, as strong as white prejudicesagainst the non-white. But I know that America's five and a half million Jews (two million of themare concentrated in New York) look at it very practically, whether they know it or not: that all of thebigotry and hatred focused upon the black man keeps off the Jew a lot of heat that would be onhim otherwise. 
现在，我当然可以理解犹太人的敏感性。两千年来，宗教和个人对犹太人的偏见一直存在并得到发泄和实践，就像白人对非白人的偏见一样强烈。但我知道美国550万犹太人（其中200万人集中在纽约）非常实际地看待这个问题，无论他们是否知道：所有针对黑人的偏执和仇恨都让犹太人远离了很多本来会落在他们身上的麻烦。
For an example of what I am talking about-in every black ghetto, Jews own the major businesses.Every night the owners of those businesses go home with that black community's money, whichhelps the ghetto to stay poor. But I doubt that I have ever uttered this absolute truth before anaudience without being hotly challenged, and accused by a Jew of anti-Semitism. Why? I will betthat I have told five hundred such challengers that Jews as a group would never watch someother minority systematically siphoning out their community's resources without doing somethingabout it. I have told them that if I tell the simple truth, it doesn't mean that I am anti-Semitic; itmeans merely that I am anti-exploitation. 
举个例子，说明我所说的是什么——在每个黑人贫民窟中，犹太人拥有主要的商业。每天晚上，这些商业的所有者带着那个黑人社区的钱回家，这有助于贫民窟保持贫穷。但我怀疑我以前在观众面前说出这个绝对真理时没有被激烈地挑战过，也没有被犹太人指责为反犹太主义。为什么？我会打赌，我已经告诉过五百个这样的挑战者，作为一个群体，犹太人永远不会看着其他少数族裔系统地吸走他们社区的资源而不采取任何行动。我告诉他们，如果我说出了简单的事实，并不意味着我是反犹太主义的；这只意味着我只是反对剥削。
 The white liberal may be a little taken aback to know that from all-Negro audiences I never havehad one challenge, never one question that defended the white man. That has been true evenwhen a lot of those "black bourgeoisie" and "integration"-mad Negroes were among the blacks.All Negroes, among themselves, admit the white man's criminal record. They may not know asmany details as I do, but they know the general picture. 
白人自由主义者可能会有点吃惊地知道，从全黑人观众中，我从来没有遇到过一个挑战，也从来没有一个问题是捍卫白人的。即使在很多“黑人资产阶级”和“融合”狂热的黑人中间也是如此。所有的黑人都承认白人的犯罪记录。他们可能不知道像我一样的细节，但他们知道大致情况。
But, let me tell you something significant: This very same bourgeois Negro who, among Negroes,would never make a fool of himself in trying to defend the white man-watch that same Negro in amixed black and white audience, knowing he's overheard by his beloved "Mr. Charlie." Why, youshould hear those Negroes attack me, trying to justify, or forgive the white man's crimes! TheseNegroes are people who bring me nearest to breaking one of my principal rules, which is never tolet myself become over-emotional and angry. Why, sometimes I've felt I ought to jump down offthat stand and get _physical_ with some of those brainwashed white man's tools, parrots,puppets. At the colleges, I've developed some stock put-downs for them: "You must be a lawstudent, aren't you?" They have to say either yes, or no. And I say, "I thought you were. Youdefend this criminal white man harder than he defends his guilty self!" One particular university's"token-integrated" black Ph.D. associate professor I never will forget; he got me so mad I couldn'tsee straight. As badly as our 22 millions of educationally deprived black people need the help ofany brains he has, there he was looking like some fly in the buttermilk among white"colleagues"-and he was trying to _eat me up_! He was ranting about what a "divisivedemagogue" and what a "reverse racist" I was. I was racking my head, to spear that fool; finally Iheld up my hand, and he stopped. "Do you know what white racists call black Ph.D's?" He saidsomething like, "I believe that I happen not to be aware of that"-you know, one of these ultra- proper-talking Negroes. And I laid the word down on him, loud: "Nigger!" 
但是，让我告诉你一些重要的事情：正是这个同样的资产阶级黑人，在黑人中间永远不会试图为白人但是，让我告诉你一些重要的事情：正是这个同样的资产阶级黑人，在黑人中间永远不会试图为白人辩护而让自己出丑——看看他在黑白混合的观众中的表现，知道他被他心爱的“查理先生”听到了。为什么，你应该听到那些黑人攻击我，试图证明或原谅白人的罪行！这些黑人让我最接近打破我的一个主要规则之一，那就是永远不要让自己过于情绪化和愤怒。为什么，有时候我觉得我应该从讲台上跳下来，和那些被洗脑的白人工具、鹦鹉、木偶们进行身体上的对抗。在大学里，我为他们准备了一些贬低的话：“你一定是学法律的学生，不是吗？”他们必须回答是或否。我说：“我以为你是。你比这个犯罪的白人更努力地为他辩护！”我永远不会忘记一个特别的大学的“象征性融合”的黑人博士副教授；他让我气得看不清楚。尽管我们2200万教育匮乏的黑人需要他的任何智慧的帮助，但他却像白种人中的苍蝇一样——而且他还试图把我吃掉！他咆哮着说我是一个“分裂煽动者”和一个“逆向种族主义者”。我绞尽脑汁，想要打败那个傻瓜；最后我举起手来，他停了下来。“你知道白人种族主义者怎么称呼黑人博士吗？”他说：“我相信我并不了解这一点”——你知道，这是一个非常正式的谈话方式的黑人。我大声地向他宣布这个词：“黑鬼！”

Speaking in these colleges and universities was good for the Nation of Islam, I would report to Mr.Muhammad, because the devilish white man's best minds were developed and influenced in thecolleges and universities. But for some reason that I could never understand until much later, Mr.Muhammad never really wanted me to speak at these colleges and universities. 
在这些大学里演讲对伊斯兰国家有好处，我会向穆罕默德先生汇报，因为邪恶的白人最好的思想是在大学里发展和受到影响的。但是出于某种原因，我直到很久以后才理解，穆罕默德先生从来不真正希望我在这些大学里演讲。
I was to learn later, from Mr. Muhammad's own sons, that he was envious because he feltunequipped to speak at colleges himself. But nevertheless, in Mr. Muhammad's behalf at thistime, I was finding these highly intelligent audiences amazingly open-minded and objective intheir receptions of the raw, naked truths that I would tell them: 
我后来从穆罕默德先生自己的儿子那里得知，他感到自己没有能力在大学里演讲，因此感到嫉妒。但是，在这个时候，我代表穆罕默德先生发现这些非常聪明的听众在接受我所告诉他们的原始、赤裸裸的真相时，表现出令人惊讶的开放和客观：
"Time and time again, the black, the brown, the red, and the yellow races have witnessed andsuffered the white man's small ability to understand the simple notes of the spirit. The white manseems tone deaf to the total orchestration of humanity. Every day, his newspapers' front pagesshow us the world that he has created. 
一次又一次，黑人、棕色人种、红色人和黄色人种都见证了白人理解精神的简单音符的微小能力。白人似乎对人类的整体协调没有感觉。每天，他的报纸头版向我们展示了他所创造的世界。
"God's wrathful judgment is close upon this white man stumbling and groping blindly inwickedness and evil and spiritual darkness. 
"上帝愤怒的审判即将降临在这个蹒跚而行、盲目摸索着邪恶和灵性黑暗的白人身上。
"Look-remaining today are only two giant white nations, America and Russia, each of them withmistrustful, nervous satellites. America is propping up most of the remaining white world. TheFrench, the Belgians, the Dutch, the Portuguese, the Spanish and other white nations haveweakened steadily as non-white Asians and Africans have recovered their lands. 
"今天只剩下两个巨大的白人国家，美国和俄罗斯，它们各自都有着不信任、紧张的卫星国。美国正在支持着世界上大部分剩下的白人国家。随着非白人亚洲人和非洲人重新夺回他们的土地，法国、比利时、荷兰、葡萄牙、西班牙和其他白人国家的实力已经逐渐减弱。
"America is subsidizing what is left of the prestige and strength of the once mighty Britain. Thesun has set forever on that monocled, pith-helmeted resident colonialist, sipping tea with hisdelicate lady in the non-white coloniesbeing systematically robbed of every valuable resource.Britain's superfluous royalty and nobility now exist by charging tourists to inspect the oncebaronial castles, and by selling memoirs, perfumes, autographs, titles, and even themselves. 
"美国正在补贴曾经强大的英国所剩下的声望和实力。太阳永远落下了，那些戴着单片眼镜、头盔的殖民地居民，在被系统地抢劫走每一份宝贵资源的非白人殖民地中，与他们的优雅女士一起品茶。英国的多余皇室和贵族现在通过向游客收取费用来检查曾经的男爵城堡，并通过出售回忆录、香水、签名、头衔甚至自己来维持生计。
"The whole world knows that the white man cannot survive another war. If either of the two giantwhite nations pushes the button, white civilization will die! 
"全世界都知道，白人无法在另一场战争中生存下去。如果这两个巨大的白人国家中的任何一个按下按钮，白色文明将会灭亡！"
"And we see again that not ideologies, but race, and color, is what binds human beings. Is itaccidental that as Red Chinese visit African and Asian countries, Russia and America drawsteadily closer to each other? 
"我们再次看到，不是意识形态，而是种族和肤色，是人类团结在一起的东西。当红色中国人访问非洲和亚洲国家时，俄罗斯和美国逐渐接近彼此，这是偶然的吗？"
"The collective white man's history has left the non-white peoples no alternative, either, but todraw closer to each other. Characteristically, as always, the devilish white man lacks the moralstrength and courage to cast off his arrogance. He wants, today, to 'buy' friends among the non- whites. He tries, characteristically, to cover up his past record. He does not possess the humilityto admit his guilt, to try and atone for his crimes. The white man has perverted the simplemessage of love that the Prophet Jesus lived and taught when He walked upon this earth." 
"白人集体的历史也没有给非白人留下任何选择，只能彼此更加接近。典型的是，像往常一样，邪恶的白人缺乏道德力量和勇气来摆脱他的傲慢。今天，他想要在非白人中“购买”朋友。他试图掩盖自己的过去记录，这是典型的。他没有谦虚地承认自己的罪行，并试图弥补自己的罪行。白人歪曲了先知耶稣在地上行走时所生活和教导的简单的爱的信息。"
Audiences seemed surprised when I spoke about Jesus. I would explain that we Muslims believein the Prophet Jesus. He was one of the three most important Prophets of the religion of Islam,the others being Muhammad and Moses. In Jerusalem there are Muslim shrines built to theProphet Jesus. I would explain that it was our belief that Christianity did not perform what Christtaught. I never failed to cite that even Billy Graham, challenged in Africa, had himself made thedistinction, "I believe in Christ, not Christianity." 
当我谈到耶稣时，听众们似乎感到惊讶。我会解释说，我们穆斯林相信先知耶稣。他是伊斯兰教最重要的三位先知之一，另外两位是穆罕默德和摩西。在耶路撒冷，有为先知耶稣建造的穆斯林圣地。我会解释说，我们相信基督教没有践行基督所教导的东西。我总是会引用比利·格雷厄姆的话来说明这一点，他在非洲受到挑战时曾说过：“我相信基督，而不是基督教。”
I never will forget one little blonde co-ed after I had spoken at her New England college. She musthave caught the next plane behind that one I took to New York. She found the Muslim restaurantin Harlem. I just happened to be there when she came in. Her clothes, her carriage, her accent,all showed Deep South white breeding and money. At that college, I told how the antebellumwhite slavemaster even devilishly manipulated his own woman. He convinced her that she was"too pure" for his base "animal instincts." With this "noble" ruse, he conned his own wife to lookaway from his obvious preference for the "animal" black woman. So the "delicate mistress" satand watched the plantation's little mongrel-complexioned children, sired obviously by her father,her husband, her brothers, her sons. I said at that college that the guilt of American whitesincluded their knowledge that in hating Negroes, they were hating, they were rejecting, they weredenying, their own blood. 
我永远不会忘记在新英格兰的一所大学演讲后遇到的一个金发女学生。她一定是在我乘飞机去纽约后马上乘坐下一班飞机赶来的。她在哈莱姆找到了穆斯林餐厅。当我进去时，她刚好也在那里。她的衣着、举止和口音都显示出她是南方白人血统，家境富裕。在那所大学里，我讲述了美国内战前白人奴隶主如何狡猾地操纵自己的女人。他说服她认为自己“太纯洁”了，无法满足他卑劣的“动物本能”。通过这种“高尚”的花招，他欺骗了自己的妻子，让她不去注意他对“动物”黑人女人的明显偏爱。所以这位“优雅的情妇”坐在那里看着种植园里那些混血的孩子，他们显然是她的父亲、丈夫、兄弟、儿子所生。我在那所大学说，美国白人的罪恶包括他们知道在憎恨黑人的同时，他们也在憎恨、排斥和否认自己的血液。
Anyway, I'd never seen anyone I ever spoke before more affected than this little white college girl.She demanded, right up in my face, "Don't you believe there are any _good_ white people?" Ididn't want to hurt her feelings. I told her, "People's _deeds_ I believe in, Miss-not their words." 
不管怎样，我从来没有见过我以前说过的任何人比这个白人大学女生更受影响。她在我面前要求道：“难道你不相信有好的白人吗？”我不想伤害她的感情。我告诉她：“我相信人们的事迹，而不是他们的话。”
"What can I _do_?" she exclaimed. I told her, "Nothing." She burst out crying, and ran out and upLenox Avenue and caught a taxi. 
“我能做些什么？”她喊道。我告诉她：“什么也做不了。”她突然哭了起来，跑出去上了伦诺克斯大道，叫了一辆出租车。
*     *     * 
Mr. Muhammad-each time I'd go to see him in Chicago, or in Phoenix-would warm me with hisexpressions of his approval and confidence in me. 
穆罕默德先生— —每次我去芝加哥或凤凰城看他时，他都会对我表示赞许和信任，这让我倍感温暖。
He left me in charge of the Nation of Islam's affairs when he made an Omra pilgrimage to theHoly City Mecca. 
当他去圣地麦加朝圣时，他让我负责伊斯兰国家事务。
I believed so strongly in Mr. Muhammad that I would have hurled myself between him and anassassin.A chance event brought crashing home to me that there was something-one thing-greater thanmy reverence for Mr. Muhammad. 
我非常信任穆罕默德先生，以至于我会扑到他和刺客之间。一个偶然的事件使我彻底明白，有一件事— —只有一件事— —比我对穆罕默德先生的崇敬更重要。
It was the awesomeness of my reason to revere him. 
这是我崇敬他的理由的威力。
I was the invited speaker at the Harvard Law School Forum. I happened to glance through awindow. Abruptly, I realized that I was looking in the direction of the apartment house that was myold burglary gang's hideout. 
我是哈佛法学院论坛的受邀演讲者。我碰巧瞥了一眼窗户。突然，我意识到我正在朝着我曾经的老盗窃团伙藏身的公寓楼的方向看。
It rocked me like a tidal wave. Scenes from my once depraved life lashed through my mind._Living_ like an animal; _thinking_ like an animal! 
它像海啸一样震撼着我。我曾经堕落的生活场景在我脑海中闪现。 _生活_得像动物； _思考_得像动物！
Awareness came surging up in me-how deeply the religion of Islam had reached down into themud to lift me up, to save me from being what I inevitably would have been: a dead criminal in agrave, or, if still alive, a flint-hard, bitter, thirty-seven-year-old convict in some penitentiary, orinsane asylum. Or, at best, I would have been an old, fading Detroit Red, hustling, stealingenough for food and narcotics, and myself being stalked as prey by cruelly ambitious youngerhustlers such as Detroit Red had been. 
我突然意识到，伊斯兰教义已经深深地植根于我的内心，将我从深渊中拯救出来，让我免于成为不可避免的罪犯：一个坟墓里的死囚，或者如果还活着，就是一个坚硬如燧石、苦涩的37岁囚犯，被关在监狱或精神病院里。或者，充其量，我会成为一个年迈而褪色的底特律红人队球员，为了食物和毒品而奔波，自己也被残忍而有野心的年轻贩子所追逐，就像底特律红人队曾经追捕猎物一样。
But Allah had blessed me to learn about the religion of Islam, which had enabled me to lift myselfup from the muck and the mire of this rotting world. 
但是真主保佑我学习了伊斯兰教义，这让我能够从这个腐朽世界的泥沼中拯救自己。
And there I stood, the invited speaker, at Harvard. 
而我，作为受邀演讲者，站在哈佛大学。
A story that I had read in prison when I was reading a lot of Greek mythology flicked into myhead. 
我在监狱里读了很多希腊神话故事，其中有一则故事突然闪现在我的脑海中。
The boy Icarus. Do you remember the story? 
伊卡洛斯的故事。你还记得吗？
  Icarus' father made some wings that he fastened with wax. "Never fly but so high with thesewings," the father said. But soaring around, this way, that way, Icarus' flying pleased him so thathe began thinking he was flying on his own merit. Higher, he flew-higher-until the heat of the sunmelted the wax holding those wings. And down came Icarus-tumbling. 
伊卡洛斯的父亲用蜡做了一对翅膀，并告诉他：“用这对翅膀飞行时，不要飞得太高。”但是伊卡洛斯在空中翱翔时，感到非常愉悦，以至于他开始认为自己可以凭借自己的能力飞行。他越飞越高，直到太阳的热量融化了固定翅膀的蜡。伊卡洛斯坠落下来，摔得很惨。
Standing there by that Harvard window, I silently vowed to Allah that I never would forget that anywings I wore had been put on by the religion of Islam. That fact I never have forgotten . . . not forone second. 
站在哈佛大学的窗前，我默默地向真主发誓，我永远不会忘记我所穿戴的任何翅膀都是由伊斯兰教义赋予的。这个事实我从未忘记过……一秒也没有。
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
第十六章
OUT 
输出
In nineteen sixty-one, Mr. Muhammad's condition grew suddenly worse. 
1961年，穆罕默德先生的情况突然恶化。
As he talked with me when I visited him, when he talked with anyone, he would unpredictablybegin coughing harder, and harder, until his body was wracked and jerking in agonies that werepainful to watch, and Mr. Muhammad would have to take to his bed. 
在我拜访他的时候，只要他跟别人说话，就会不期而然地开始咳嗽得越来越厉害，直到他的身子剧烈抽搐，痛苦不堪，不得不卧床休息。
We among Mr. Muhammad's officials, and his family, kept the situation to ourselves, while wecould. Few other Muslims became aware of Mr. Muhammad's condition until there were last- minute cancellations of long-advertised personal appearances at some big Muslim rallies.Muslims knew that only something really serious would ever have stopped the Messenger fromkeeping his promise to be with them at their rallies. Their questions had to be answered, and thenews of our leader's illness swiftly spread through the Nation of Islam. 
我们作为穆罕默德先生的官员和他的家人，在可能的情况下，将情况保密。直到最后一刻才取消长期宣传的在一些大型穆斯林集会上的个人露面，很少有其他穆斯林知道穆罕默德先生的状况。穆斯林知道只有真正严重的事情才会阻止使者履行他与他们在集会上的承诺。他们的问题必须得到回答，而关于我们领袖疾病的消息迅速传遍了伊斯兰国家。
Anyone not a Muslim could not conceive what the possible loss of Mr.Muhammad would havemeant among his followers. To us, the Nation of Islam was Mr. Muhammad. What bonded us intothe best organization black Americans ever had was every Muslim's devout regard for Mr.Muhammad as black America's moral, mental, and spiritual reformer. 
任何非穆斯林都无法想象穆罕默德先生的追随者们可能失去他意味着什么。对我们来说，伊斯兰国家就是穆罕默德先生。将我们团结成美国黑人曾经拥有过的最好的组织的是每个穆斯林对穆罕默德先生的虔诚的尊重，他是美国黑人的道德、精神和精神改革者。
Stated another way, we Muslims regarded ourselves as moral and mental and spiritual examplesfor other black Americans, because we followed the personal example of Mr. Muhammad. Blackcommunities discussed with respect how Muslims were suspended if they lied, gambled, cheated,or smoked. For moral crimes, such as fornication or adultery, Mr. Muhammad personally wouldmete out sentences of from one to five years of "isolation," if not complete expulsion from theNation. And Mr. Muhammad would punish his officials more readily than the newest convert in amosque. He said that any defecting official betrayed both himself and his position as a leader andexample for other Muslims. For every Muslim, in his rejection of immoral temptation, the beaconwas Mr. Muhammad. All Muslims felt as one that without his light, we would all be in darkness. 
换句话说，我们穆斯林认为自己是美国黑人的道德、精神和精神榜样，因为我们遵循了穆罕默德先生的个人榜样。黑人社区尊重地讨论了如果穆斯林撒谎、赌博、欺骗或吸烟会有什么后果。对于道德犯罪，如通奸或婚外情，穆罕默德先生会亲自判处一年到五年的“隔离”，如果不是完全被驱逐出国家的话。穆罕默德先生对他的官员比对清真寺里最新的皈依者更容易惩罚。他说，任何叛变的官员都背叛了自己和他的领导地位，以及他作为其他穆斯林的榜样。对于每个穆斯林来说，在他拒绝不道德的诱惑时，灯塔就是穆罕默德先生。所有穆斯林都感到，没有他的指引，我们都将处于黑暗之中。
As I have related, doctors recommended a dry climate to ease Mr. Muhammad's condition.Quickly we found up for sale in Phoenix the home of the saxophone player, Louis Jordan. TheNation's treasury purchased the home, and Mr. Muhammad soon moved there. 
正如我所讲述的，医生建议干燥的气候可以缓解穆罕默德先生的状况。很快我们在凤凰城找到了萨克斯管演奏家路易斯·乔丹的房子出售。国家金库购买了这所房子，穆罕默德先生很快就搬了进去。
Only by being two people could I have worked harder in the service of the Nation of Islam. I hadevery gratification that I wanted. I had helped bring about the progress and national impact suchthat none could call us liars when we called Mr. Muhammad the most powerful black man inAmerica. I had helped Mr. Muhammad and his other ministers to revolutionize the American blackman's thinking, opening his eyes until he would never again look in the same fearful, worshipfulway at the white man. I had participated in spreading the truths that had done so much to help theAmerican black man rid himself ofthe mirage that the white race was made up of "superior"beings. I had been a part of the tapping of something in the black secret soul. 
只有作为两个人，我才能更努力地为伊斯兰国家服务。我得到了我想要的一切满足感。我帮助推动了进步和国家影响，以至于当我们称穆罕默德先生为美国最强大的黑人时，没有人可以称我们为骗子。我帮助穆罕默德先生和其他部长改变了美国黑人的思想，开阔了他的视野，直到他再也不会以同样恐惧、崇拜的方式看待白人。我参与了传播真相，这对帮助美国黑人摆脱白人种族是由“优越”生物组成的幻想起到了很大作用。我是挖掘黑人秘密灵魂中某些东西的一部分。
If I harbored any personal disappointment whatsoever, it was that privately I was convinced thatour Nation of Islam could be an even greater force in the American black man's overall struggle-ifwe engaged in more _action_. By that, I mean I thought privately that we should have amended,or relaxed, our general non-engagement policy. I felt that, wherever black people committedthemselves, in the Little Rocks and the Birminghams and other places, militantly disciplinedMuslims should also be there-for all the world to see, and respect, and discuss. 
如果我有任何个人的失望，那就是私下里我相信我们的伊斯兰国家可以成为美国黑人整体斗争中更强大的力量——如果我们参与更多的行动。我的意思是，我认为我们应该修改或放宽我们的一般不介入政策。无论黑人在哪里投入自己，在小石城、伯明翰和其他地方，受过军事训练的穆斯林也应该在那里——让全世界看到、尊重和讨论。
It could be heard increasingly in the Negro communities: "Those Muslims _talk_ tough, but theynever _do_ anything, unless somebody bothers Muslims." I moved around among outsiders morethan most other Muslim officials. I felt the very real potentiality that, considering the mercurialmoods of the black masses, this labeling of Muslims as "talk only" could see us, powerful as wewere, one day suddenly separated from the Negroes' front-line struggle. 
在黑人社区中，人们越来越多地听到这样的话：“那些穆斯林说话强硬，但他们从不采取任何行动，除非有人惹恼了穆斯林。”我比其他大多数穆斯林官员更多地与外界人士接触。考虑到黑人群众的情绪多变，我感到这种将穆斯林称为“只说不做”的标签可能会让我们突然从黑人前线斗争中分离出来，尽管我们很强大。
But beyond that single personal concern, I couldn't have asked Allah to bless my efforts any morethan he had. Islam in New York City was growing faster than anywhere in America. From the onetiny mosque to which Mr. Muhammad had originally sent me, I had now built three of the Nation'smost powerful and aggressive mosques-Harlem's Seven-A in Manhattan, Corona's Seven-B inQueens, and Mosque Seven-C in Brooklyn. And on a national basis, I had either directlyestablished, or I had helped to establish, most of the one hundred or more mosques in the fiftystates. I was crisscrossing North America sometimes as often as four times a week. Often, whatsleep I got was caught in the jet planes. I was maintaining a marathon schedule of press, radio,television, and public-speaking commitments. The only way that I could keep up with my job forMr. Muhammad was by flying with the wings that he had given me.*     *     * 
但是除了这个个人问题之外，我不能要求真主保佑我的努力了。纽约市的伊斯兰教比美国任何地方都发展得更快。从穆罕默德先生最初派我去的那个小清真寺开始，现在我已经在这个国家建立了三个最有影响力和攻击性的清真寺——曼哈顿的哈莱姆七A、皇后区的科罗娜七B和布鲁克林的七C清真寺。在全国范围内，我已经直接或帮助建立了五十个州中100多个清真寺中的大部分。我有时在北美穿梭，有时一周四次。经常，我在喷气式飞机上睡觉。我保持着与媒体、广播、电视和公众演讲的承诺马拉松式的日程安排。唯一能让我为穆罕默德先生工作的方法就是用他给我的翅膀飞翔。*
As far back as 1961, when Mr. Muhammad's illness took that turn for the worse, I had heardchance negative remarks concerning me. I had heard veiled implications. I had noticed other littleevidences of the envy and of the jealousy which Mr. Muhammad had prophesied. For example, itwas being said that "Minister Malcolm is trying to take over the Nation," it was being said that Iwas "taking credit" for Mr. Muhammad's teaching, it was being said that I was trying to "build anempire" for myself. It was being said that I loved playing "coast-to-coast Mr. Big Shot." 
早在1961年，当穆罕默德先生的病情恶化时，我就听到了一些关于我的负面言论。我听到了含糊其辞的暗示。我注意到了其他一些小证据，表明了嫉妒和嫉妒，这是穆罕默德先生预言过的。例如，有人说“马尔科姆部长试图接管这个国家”，有人说我在“为穆罕默德先生的教学工作争取荣誉”，还有人说我试图为自己“建立一个帝国”。有人说我喜欢玩“从东海岸到西海岸的大人物”游戏。
When I heard these things, actually, they didn't anger me. They helped me to re-steel my innerresolve that such lies would never become true of me. I would always remember that Mr.Muhammad had prophesied this envy and jealousy. This would help me to ignore it, because Iknew that _he_ would understand if _he_ ever should hear such talk. 
当我听到这些事情时，实际上并没有让我生气。它们帮助我重新坚定了我内心的决心，即这些谎言永远不会成为我的真相。我会一直记得穆罕默德先生预言的这种嫉妒和嫉妒。这将帮助我忽略它，因为我知道如果他曾经听到过这样的谈话，他会理解的。
A frequent rumor among non-Muslims was "Malcolm X is making a pile of money." All Muslims atleast knew better than that. _Me_ making money? The F.B.I. and the C.I.A. and the 
非穆斯林之间经常流传着一个谣言：“Malcolm X正在赚大钱。”所有穆斯林至少都比这个知道得更多。我赚钱？联邦调查局和中央情报局以及
I.R.S. all combined can't turn up a thing I got, beyond a car to drive and a seven-room house tolive in. (And by now the Nation of Islam is jealously and greedily trying to take away even thathouse.) I had _access_ to money. Yes! Elijah Muhammad would authorize for me any amountthat I asked for. But he knew, as every Muslim official knew, that every nickel and dime I ever gotwas used to promote the Nation of Islam. 
联邦调查局、中央情报局和国税局加在一起也找不到我拥有的东西，除了一辆车和一套七居室的房子。（现在，伊斯兰国家正嫉妒而贪婪地试图夺走这套房子。）我可以接触到钱。是的！伊利亚·穆罕默德会授权给我任何我想要的金额。但是他知道，就像每个穆斯林官员都知道的那样，我得到的每一分钱都被用来推广伊斯兰国家。
My attitude toward money generated the only domestic quarrel that I have ever had with mybeloved wife Betty. As our children increased in number, so didBetty's hints to me that I shouldput away _something_ for our family. But I refused, and finally we had this argument. I put my footdown. I knew I had in Betty a wife who would sacrifice her life for me if such an occasion everpresented itself to her, but still I told her that too many organizations had been destroyed byleaders who tried to benefit personally, often goaded into it by their wives. We nearly broke upover this argument. I finally convinced Betty that if anything ever happened to me, the Nation ofIslam would take care of her for the rest of her life, and of our children until they were grown. Icould never have been a bigger fool! 
我对金钱的态度引发了我和心爱的妻子贝蒂之间唯一的一次家庭争吵。随着我们的孩子越来越多，贝蒂也越来越频繁地向我暗示我应该为家庭存点钱。但我拒绝了，最终我们发生了争吵。我坚决地拒绝了她的要求。我知道如果我遇到什么困难，贝蒂会为我牺牲自己的生命，但我还是告诉她，太多的组织都被试图从中获得个人利益的领导人摧毁了，而这些领导人往往是被他们的妻子激怒的。我们因为这次争吵差点分手。最后，我说服贝蒂，如果有什么不幸降临到我身上，伊斯兰国家会在余生中照顾她和我们的孩子，直到他们长大成人。我再也不能比这更傻了！
In every radio or television appearance, in every newspaper interview, I always made it crystalclear that I was Mr. Muhammad's _representative_. Anyone who ever heard me make a publicspeech during this time knows that at least once a minute I said, "The Honorable ElijahMuhammad teaches-" I would refuse to talk with any person who ever tried any so-called "joke"about my constant reference to Mr. Muhammad. Whenever anyone said, or wrote, "Malcolm X,the number two Black Muslim-" I would recoil. I have called up reporters and radio and televisionnewscasters long-distance and asked them never to use that phrasing again, explaining to them:"_All_ Muslims are number two-after Mr. Muhammad." 
在每一次广播或电视露面，每一次报纸采访中，我总是清楚地表明我是穆罕默德先生的代理人。任何听过我在这段时间里的公开演讲的人都知道，我每分钟至少会说一句：“尊敬的伊利亚·穆罕默德教导……”如果有人试图对我不断提及穆罕默德先生进行所谓的“玩笑”，我会拒绝与他们交谈。每当有人说或写“马尔科姆X，第二号黑人穆斯林……”时，我都会退缩。我曾经打电话给记者、电台和电视台的新闻播音员，要求他们永远不要再使用这种措辞，并向他们解释：“所有的穆斯林都是第二号——仅次于穆罕默德先生。”
My briefcase was stocked with Mr. Muhammad's photographs. I gave them to photographers whosnapped my picture. I would telephone editors asking them, "Please use Mr. Muhammad's pictureinstead of mine." When, to my joy, Mr. Muhammad agreed to grant interviews to white writers, Irarely spoke to a white writer, or a black one either, whom I didn't urge to visit Mr. Muhammad inperson in Chicago-"Get the truth from the Messenger in person"-and a number of them did gothere and meet and interview him. 
我的公文包里装满了穆罕默德先生的照片。我把它们给了给我拍照的摄影师。我会打电话给编辑，请求他们“请用穆罕默德先生的照片代替我的照片”。当令我高兴的是，穆罕默德先生同意接受白人作家的采访时，我很少与白人或黑人作家交谈，除非我敦促他们亲自去芝加哥拜访穆罕默德先生——“从使者那里亲自了解真相”——其中一些人确实去了那里，并与他见面并采访了他。
Both white people and Negroes-even including Muslims-would make me uncomfortable, alwaysgiving me so much credit for the steady progress that theNation of Islam was making. "All praiseis due to Allah," I told everybody. "Anything creditable that I do is due to Mr. Elijah Muhammad." 
白人和黑人——甚至包括穆斯林——都会让我感到不舒服，总是对我在伊斯兰国家取得的稳步进展给予如此多的赞扬。“一切赞美都归功于真主，”我对每个人说。“我所做的任何值得赞扬的事情都是因为伊利亚·穆罕默德先生。”
I believe that no man in the Nation of Islam could have gained the international prominence Igained with the wings Mr. Muhammad had put on me-plus having the freedom that he granted meto take liberties and do things on my own-and still have remained as faithful and as selfless aservant to him as I was. 
我相信，在伊斯兰国家中没有人能够像我一样获得国际知名度——这是穆罕默德先生赋予我的翅膀所带来的——再加上他给予我自由去做自己想做的事情——并且仍然像我曾经那样忠实无私地为他服务。
I would say that it was in 1962 when I began to notice that less and less about me appeared inour Nation's _Muhammad Speaks_. I learned that Mr. Muhammad's son, Herbert, now thepaper's publisher, had instructed that as little as possible be printed about me. In fact, there wasmore in the Muslim paper about integrationist Negro "leaders" than there was about me. I couldread more about myself in the European, Asian, and African press. 
我想说的是，大约在1962年，我开始注意到《伊斯兰国家之声》上关于我的报道越来越少。我得知穆罕默德先生的儿子赫伯特现在是该报的出版商，他指示尽量少刊登关于我的内容。事实上，穆斯林报纸上关于融合主义黑人“领袖”的报道比关于我的报道更多。我可以在欧洲、亚洲和非洲的媒体上读到更多关于我自己的报道。
I am not griping about publicity for myself. I already had received more publicity than many worldpersonages. But I resented the fact that the Muslims' own newspaper denied them news ofimportant things being done in their behalf, simply because it happened that I had done thethings. I was conducting rallies, trying to propagate Mr. Muhammad's teachings, and because ofjealo usy and narrow-mindedness finally I got no coverage at all-for by now an order had beengiven to completely black me out of the newspaper. For instance, I spoke to eight thousandstudents at the University of California, and the press there gave big coverage to what I said ofthe power and program of Mr. Muhammad. But when I got to Chicago, expecting at least afavorable response and some coverage, I met only a chilly reaction. The same thing happenedwhen, in Harlem, I staged a rally that drew seven thousand people. At that time, Chicagoheadquarters was even discouraging me from staging large rallies. But the next week, I heldanother Harlem rally that was even bigger and more successfulthan the first one-and obviouslythis only increased the envy of the Chicago headquarters. 
我并不是在抱怨自己没有得到足够的宣传。我已经得到了比许多世界名人更多的宣传。但我对这样一个事实感到不满：穆斯林自己的报纸拒绝向他们报道为他们所做的重要事情，只是因为这些事情是由我来完成的。我正在组织集会，试图传播穆罕默德先生的教导，但由于嫉妒和狭隘的心态，最终我在报纸上完全被封锁了——因为现在有命令要求完全封锁我在报纸上的报道。例如，我在加利福尼亚大学向八千名学生发表了演讲，那里的媒体对我所说的关于穆罕默德先生的力量和计划给予了大量报道。但是当我回到芝加哥时，我期望至少能得到一些有利的回应和报道，却只遇到了冷淡的反应。同样的事情也发生在哈莱姆，我在那里组织了一场吸引了七千人参加的集会。当时，芝加哥总部甚至不鼓励我举办大型集会。但第二周，我在哈莱姆又举办了一场更大的、比第一次更成功的集会——这显然只会增加芝加哥总部的嫉妒之情。
But I would put these things out of my mind, as they occurred. 
但是我会把这些事从我的脑海中排除，因为它们发生了。
At least, as much as I humanly could, I put them out of my mind. I am not trying to make myselfseem right and noble. I am telling the truth. I _loved_ the Nation, and Mr. Muhammad. I _livedfor_ the Nation, and for Mr. Muhammad. 
至少，我尽力不去想这些事情。我不是想让自己看起来正确和高尚。我只是在讲述真相。我热爱这个国家和穆罕默德先生。我为这个国家和穆罕默德先生而活。
It made other Muslim officials jealous because my picture was often in the daily press. Theywouldn't remember that my picture was there because of my fervor in championing Mr.Muhammad. They wouldn't simply reason that as vulnerable as the Nation of Islam was todistorted rumors and outright lies, we needed nothing so little as to have our public spokesmanconstantly denying the rumors. Common sense would have told any official that certainly Mr.Muhammad couldn't be running all over the country as his own spokesman. And whoever heappointed as his spokesman couldn't avoid a lot of press focus. 
这引起了其他穆斯林官员的嫉妒，因为我的照片经常出现在每日新闻中。他们不会记得我的照片在那里是因为我对穆罕默德先生的拥护热情。他们不会简单地认为伊斯兰国家对于被歪曲的谣言和彻头彻尾的谎言是脆弱的，我们需要做的不仅仅是让我们的发言人不断否认谣言。常识会告诉任何官员，当然穆罕默德先生不可能自己作为发言人跑遍全国。而被指定为他发言人的人也无法避免媒体的关注。
Whenever I caught any resentful feelings hanging on in my mind, I would be ashamed of myself,considering it a sign of weakness in myself. I knew that at least Mr. Muhammad knew that my lifewas totally dedicated to representing him. 
每当我发现自己心中有任何怨恨的情绪时，我都会为自己感到羞耻，认为这是自己软弱的表现。我知道至少穆罕默德先生知道我的一生都致力于代表他。
But during 1963,I couldn't help being very hypersensitive to my critics in high posts within ourNation. I quit selecting certain of my New York brothers and giving them money to go and laygroundwork for new mosques in other cities-because slighting remarks were being made about"Malcolm's ministers." In a time in America when it was of arch importance for a militant blackvoice to reach mass audiences, _Life_ magazine wanted to do a personal story of me, and Irefused. I refused again when a cover story was offered by _Newsweek_. I refused again when Icould have been a guest on the top-rated "Meet thePress" television program. Each refusal was ageneral loss for the black man, and, for the Nation of Islam, each refusal was a specific loss-andeach refusal was made because of Chicago's attitude. There was jealousy because I had beenrequested to make these featured appearances. 
但在1963年，我不禁对我的批评者在国家高层职位上感到非常敏感。我停止了选择某些纽约的兄弟并给他们钱去其他城市为新的清真寺奠定基础——因为有人发表了关于“马尔科姆的部长”的轻蔑言论。在美国，一个激进的黑人声音能够达到大众观众至关重要的时代，《生活》杂志想做一个关于我个人的故事，我拒绝了。当《新闻周刊》提出封面故事时，我也再次拒绝了。当我可以成为收视率最高的“会见媒体”电视节目的嘉宾时，我也再次拒绝了。每一次拒绝都是黑人普遍的损失，而对于伊斯兰国家来说，每一次拒绝都是具体的损失——每一次拒绝都是因为芝加哥的态度而做出的。因为我被要求在这些特色节目中亮相而引起了嫉妒。
When a high-powered-rifle slug tore through the back of the N.A.A.C.P. Field Secretary MedgarEvers in Mississippi, I wanted to say the blunt truths that needed to be said. When a bomb wasexploded in a Negro Christian church in Birmingham, Alabama, snuffing out the lives of those fourbeautiful little black girls, I made comments-but not what should have been said about the climateof hate that the American white man was generating and nourishing. The more hate waspermitted to lash out when there were ways it could have been checked, the more bold the hatebecame-until at last it was flaring out at even the white man's own kind, including his own leaders.In Dallas, Texas, for instance, the then Vice President and Mrs. Johnson were vulgarly insulted.And the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson, was spat upon and hit on thehead by a white woman picket. 
当一颗高速步枪子弹穿过密西西比州美国有色人种协进会( N . A . A . C . P )外勤秘书梅加·埃弗斯的背部时，我想说出需要说的直白事实。当一枚炸弹在阿拉巴马州伯明翰市的一所黑人基督教堂爆炸，夺去那四名美丽的黑人小女孩的生命时，我发表了评论——但并没有说出关于美国白人正在制造和滋养仇恨气氛的话。当有办法可以遏制仇恨时，却允许更多的仇恨发泄出来，仇恨就会变得更加大胆——直到最后甚至白人自己的同类也受到了攻击，包括他们的领导人在内。例如，在得克萨斯州的达拉斯，当时的副总统约翰逊先生和夫人遭到了粗俗的侮辱。美国驻联合国大使阿德莱·史蒂文森被一名白人抗议者吐口水并击中头部。
Mr. Muhammad made me the Nation's first National Minister. At a late 1963 rally in Philadelphia,Mr. Muhammad, embracing me, said to that audience before us, "This is my most faithful, hard- working minister. He will follow me until he dies." 
穆罕默德先生让我成为国家的第一个国民部长。在1963年底费城的一场集会上，穆罕默德先生拥抱着我，对面前的观众说：“这是我最忠诚、最努力的部长。他会一直追随我直到死去。”
He had never paid such a compliment to any Muslim. No praise from any other earthly personcould have meant more to me. 
他从来没有对任何穆斯林这样称赞过。没有其他任何人的赞美能比这更让我感到高兴了。
But this would be Mr. Muhammad's and my last public appearance together. 
但这将是穆罕默德先生和我最后一次公开露面。
Not long before, I had been on the Jerry W illiams radio program in Boston, when someonehanded me an item hot off the Associated Press machine. I readthat a chapter of the LouisianaCitizens Council had just offered a $10,000 reward for my death.But the threat of death was much closer to me than somewhere in Louisiana. 
不久前，我在波士顿参加了杰里·威廉姆斯的广播节目，当时有人递给我一份刚从美联社机器上打印出来的消息。我读到路易斯安那州公民委员会的一个分会刚刚悬赏1万美元要取我的性命。但是死亡的威胁离我更近的地方不是路易斯安那州，而是就在这里。
What I am telling you is the truth. When I discovered who else wanted me dead, I am telling you-itnearly sent me to Bellevue. 
我告诉你的都是真的。当我发现了谁还想杀我时，我告诉你——这差点让我进了贝尔维医院。
*     *     * 
In my twelve years as a Muslim minister, I had always taught so strongly on the moral issues thatmany Muslims accused me of being "and-woman." The very keel of my teaching, and my mostbone-deep personal belief, was that Elijah Muhammad in every aspect of his existence was asymbol of moral, mental, and spiritual reform among the American black people. For twelveyears, I had taught that within the entire Nation of Islam; my own transformation was the bestexample I knew of Mr. Muhammad's power to reform black men's lives. From the time I enteredprison until I married, about twelve years later, because of Mr. Muhammad's influence upon me, Ihad never touched a woman. 
在我作为穆斯林牧师的十二年里，我一直强烈地教导道德问题，以至于许多穆斯林指责我是“男女不分”。我的教导的核心和我内心深处的个人信仰是，伊莱贾·穆罕默德在他的存在中的每一个方面都是美国黑人在道德、精神和精神上的改革的象征。十二年来，我在伊斯兰国家教过，我自己的转型是我所知道的穆罕默德先生改革黑人生活的力量的最好例子。从我进入监狱到我结婚，大约十二年后，由于穆罕默德先生对我的影响，我从未接触过女人。
But around 1963, if anyone had noticed, I spoke less and less of religion. I taught social doctrineto Muslims, and current events, and politics. I stayed wholly off the subject of morality. 
但在1963年左右，如果有人注意到了的话，我越来越少地谈论宗教。我向穆斯林传授社会教义、时事和政治。我完全避开道德问题。
And the reason for this was that my faith had been shaken in a way that I can never fullydescribe. For I had discovered Muslims had been betrayed by Elijah Muhammad himself. 
而原因是我的信念被动摇了，我无法完全描述。因为我发现穆斯林已经被伊莱贾·穆罕默德本人出卖了。
I want to make this as brief as I can, only enough so that my position and my reactions will beunderstood. As to whether or not I should reveal this, there'sno longer any need for any questionin my mind-for now the public knows. To make it concise, I will quote from one wire service storyas it appeared in newspapers, and was reported over radio and television, across the UnitedStates: 
我想尽可能简短地叙述，只够让我的立场和反应被理解。至于我是否应该透露这一点，我不再有任何疑问——因为现在公众已经知道了。为了简洁起见，我将引用一家通讯社的故事，它出现在报纸上，并在美国各地的广播和电视上报道：
"Los Angeles, July 3 (UPI)-Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim movement,today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their fourchildren. . . . Both women are in their twenties. . . .Miss Rosary and Miss Williams charged theyhad intimacies with Elijah Muhammad from 1957 until this year. Miss Rosary alleged he fatheredher two children and said she was expecting a third child by him . . . the other plaintiff said he wasthe father of her daughter. . . ." 
"洛杉矶，7月3日（UPI)-67岁的黑人穆斯林运动领袖伊莱贾·穆罕默德今天面临两名前秘书的亲子鉴定诉讼，她们指控他为她们的四个孩子的父亲。两个女人都二十多岁。罗斯里小姐和威廉姆斯小姐指控她们从1957年至今与伊莱贾·穆罕默德有亲密关系。罗斯里小姐声称他是她两个孩子的父亲，并说她正在期待他的第三个孩子。另一个原告说她的女儿是他的女儿。"
As far back as 1955, I had heard hints. But believe me when I tell you this: for me even toconsider believing anything as insane-sounding as any slightest implication of any immoralbehavior of Mr. Muhammad-why, the very idea made me shake with fear. 
早在1955年，我就听到过一些暗示。但是请相信我，当我告诉你这件事时：对我来说，即使考虑相信任何听起来像疯狂的暗示，比如穆罕默德先生的不道德行为，这个想法让我不寒而栗。
And so my mind simply refused to accept anything so grotesque as adultery mentioned in thesame breath with Mr. Muhammad's name. 
因此，我的头脑简单地拒绝接受任何如此怪诞的事情，就像通奸一样，与穆罕默德先生的名字相提并论。
_Adultery_! Why, any Muslim guilty of adultery was summarily ousted in disgrace. One of theNation's most closely kept scandals was that a succession of the personal secretaries of Mr.Muhammad had become pregnant. They were brought before Muslim courts and charged withadultery and they confessed. Humiliated before the general body, they received sentences offrom one to five years of "isolation." That meant they were to have no contact whatsoever withany other Muslims. 
通奸！为什么，任何有通奸行为的穆斯林都会立即被赶出去，蒙受耻辱。该组织最严密保守的丑闻之一是，穆罕默德先生的多位私人秘书相继怀孕。她们被带到穆斯林法庭上，被指控通奸并承认了罪行。在全体成员面前受到羞辱后，她们被判处一年到五年的“隔离”。这意味着她们不得与其他任何穆斯林有任何接触。
I don't think I could say anything which better testifies to my depth of faith in Mr. Muhammad thanthat I totally and absolutely rejected my own intelligence. I simply refused to believe.I didn't want Allah to "burn my brain" as I felt the brain of my brother Reginald had been burnedfor harboring evil thoughts about Mr. Elijah Muhammad. The last time I had seen Reginald, oneday he walked into the Mosque Seven restaurant. I saw him coming in the door. I went and methim. I looked into my own brother's eyes; I told him he wasn't welcome among Muslims, and heturned around and left, and I haven't seen him since. I did that to my own blood brother because,years before, Mr. Muhammad had sentenced Reginald to "isolation" from all other Muslims-and Iconsidered that I was a Muslim before I was Reginald's brother. 
我不认为我能够说出任何更好地证明我对穆罕默德先生的信仰深度的话，而不是完全、绝对地拒绝自己的智力。我只是拒绝接受。我不想真主烧掉我的大脑，因为我感觉到我的兄弟雷金纳德因为对伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生怀有邪恶的想法而受到了惩罚。最后一次见到雷金纳德的那天，他走进了七号清真寺餐厅。我看到他走进门来。我走过去和他见面。我看着我自己的兄弟的眼睛，告诉他在穆斯林中不受欢迎，他转身离开了，从那以后我就再也没有见过他了。我对我的亲兄弟这样做是因为几年前，穆罕默德先生判处雷金纳德与其他所有穆斯林“隔离”——我认为我是一个穆斯林，在我成为雷金纳德的兄弟之前。
No one in the world could have convinced me that Mr. Muhammad would betray the reverencebestowed upon him by all of the mosques full of poor, trusting Muslims nickeling and diming up tofaithfully support the Nation of Islam-when many of these faithful were scarcely able to pay theirown rents. 
在这个世界上，没有人能够让我相信穆罕默德先生会背叛所有贫穷、信任他的穆斯林所赋予他的在这个世界上，没有人能够让我相信穆罕默德先生会背叛所有贫穷、信任他的穆斯林所赋予他的崇敬——这些贫穷的穆斯林为了忠实地支持伊斯兰国家而省吃俭用，甚至有些人连自己的房租都付不起。
But by late 1962, I learned reliably that numerous Muslims were leaving Mosque Two in Chicago.The ugly rumor was spreading swiftly-even among non-Muslim Negroes. When I thought how thepress constantly sought ways to discredit the Nation of Islam, I trembled to think of such a thingreaching the ears of some newspaper reporter, either black or white. 
但是到了1962年底，我可靠地得知许多穆斯林正在离开芝加哥的第二清真寺。这个丑陋的谣言迅速传播——甚至在非穆斯林黑人中也是如此。当我想到媒体不断寻求诋毁伊斯兰国家的方法时，我一想到这样的事情会传到一些黑人或白人记者的耳朵里，我就感到不寒而栗。
I actually began to have nightmares . . . I saw _headlines_. 
我实际上开始做恶梦……我看到头条新闻。
I was burdened with a leaden fear as I kept speaking engagements all over America. Any time areporter came anywhere near me, I could _hear_ him ask, "Is it true, Mr. Malcolm X, this reportwe hear, that . . ." And what was I going to say? 
当我在美国各地演讲时，我背负着沉重的恐惧。每当记者靠近我时，我都能听到他问：“是真的吗，马尔科姆· X 先生，我们听到的这个报道是说……”我要说什么呢？
There was never any specific moment when I admitted the situation to myself. In the way that thehuman mind can do, somehow I slid over admitting tomyself the ugly fact, even as I begandealing with it. 
我从来没有任何特定的时刻向自己承认这种情况。以人类思维的方式，不知怎的，我开始处理这个问题时，我不知不觉地承认了这个丑陋的事实。
Both in New York and Chicago, non-Muslims whom I knew began to tell me indirectly they hadheard-or they would ask me if I had heard. I would act as if I had no idea whatever of what theywere talking about-and I was grateful when they chose not to spell out what they knew. I wentaround knowing that I looked to them like a total fool. I felt like a total fool, out there every daypreaching, and apparently not knowing what was going on right under my nose, in my ownorganization, involving the very man I was praising so. To look like a fool unearthed emotions Ihadn't felt since my Harlem hustler days. The worst thing in the hustler's world was to be a dupe. 
在纽约和芝加哥，我认识的非穆斯林开始间接地告诉我他们听说了——或者他们会问我是否听说过。我会装作对他们在说什么一无所知——当他们选择不把所知道的事情说出来时，我很感激。我知道我在他们眼中看起来像个十足的傻瓜。我觉得自己像个十足的傻瓜，每天在外面传道，显然不知道在我鼻子底下、我自己的组织里发生了什么，涉及到了我如此赞扬的那个人。看起来像个傻瓜让我感受到了自从我在哈莱姆当妓女以来从未有过的情感。在妓女的世界里，最糟糕的事情就是被欺骗。
I will give you an example. Backstage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem one day, the comedian DickGregory looked at me. "Man," he said, "Muhammad's nothing but a . . ."-I can't say the word heused. _Bam_! Just like that. My Muslim instincts said to attack Dick-but, instead, I felt weak andhollow. I think Dick sensed how upset I was and he let me get him off the subject. I knew Dick, aChicagoan, was wise in the ways of the streets, and blunt-spoken. I wanted to plead with him notto say to anyone else what he had said to me-but I couldn't; it would have been my ownadmission. 
我会给你一个例子。有一天，在哈莱姆的阿波罗剧院后台，喜剧演员迪克·格雷戈里看着我说：“伙计，穆罕默德只不过是一个……”——我不能说出他使用的词语。砰！就像那样。我的穆斯林本能告诉我要攻击迪克——但是，相反，我感到软弱和空虚。我想迪克感觉到我很难过，所以他让我转移话题。我知道迪克是芝加哥人，对街头智慧很聪明，而且直言不讳。我想恳求他不要向任何人再说他对我说的话——但我不能；那将是我自己的承认。
I can't describe the torments I went through. 
我无法形容我所经历的痛苦。
Always before, in any extremity, I had caught the first plane to Mr. Elijah Muhammad. He hadvirtually raised me from the dead. Everything I was that was creditable, he had made me . I feltthat no matter what, I could not let him down. 
以前，无论遇到什么困难，我总是搭第一班飞机去找伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生。他几乎把我从死亡线上救了回来。我所值得赞扬的一切，都是他给我的。我觉得无论如何，我不能让他失望。
There was no one I could turn to with this problem, except Mr. Muhammad himself. Ultimately thathad to be the case. But first I went to Chicago to see Mr. Muhammad's second youngest son,Wallace Muhammad. I felt that Wallacewas Mr. Muhammad's most strongly spiritual son, the sonwith the most objective outlook. Always, Wallace and I had shared an exceptional closeness andtrust. 
除了穆罕默德先生本人，我无法向任何人寻求解决这个问题的方法。最终必须如此。但首先我去了芝加哥，去见穆罕默德先生的第二个儿子华莱士·穆罕默德。我觉得华莱士是穆罕默德先生最坚强的精神之子，有着最客观的人生观。一直以来，我和华莱士之间有着特别的亲密和信任。
And Wallace knew, when he saw me, why I had come to see him. "I know," he said. I said Ithought we should rally to help his father. Wallace said he didn't feel that his father wouldwelcome any efforts to help him. I told myself that Wallace must be crazy. 
华莱士知道我为什么来找他。“我知道，”他说。我说我认为我们应该团结起来帮助他的父亲。华莱士说他觉得他的父亲不会欢迎任何帮助他的努力。我告诉自己华莱士一定是疯了。
Next, I broke the rule that no Muslim is supposed to have any contact with another Muslim in the"isolated" state. I looked up, and I talked with three of the former secretaries to Mr. Muhammad.From their own mouths, I heard their stories of who had fathered their children. And from theirown mouths I heard that Elijah Muhammad had told them I was the best, the greatest minister heever had, but that someday I would leave him, turn against him-so I was "dangerous." I learnedfrom these former secretaries of Mr. Muhammad that while he was praising me to my face, hewas tearing me apart behind my back. 
接下来，我打破了“隔离”状态下穆斯林之间不得有任何联系的规定。我抬起头来，与三位曾经担任穆罕默德先生秘书的人交谈。从他们自己的口中，我听到了他们的故事，是谁生下了他们的孩子。从他们自己口中，我听到伊莱贾·穆罕默德告诉他们，我是他拥有过的最好的、最伟大的部长，但有一天我会离开他，背叛他——所以我是“危险的”。我从这些前穆罕默德先生的秘书那里得知，当他当面赞扬我时，他在我背后却把我拆散了。
That deeply hurt me. 
那深深地伤害了我。
Every day, I was meeting the microphones, cameras, press reporters, and other commitments,including the Muslims of my own Mosque Seven. I felt almost out of my mind. 
每天，我都要面对麦克风、摄像机、新闻记者和其他承诺，包括我自己清真寺的七个穆斯林。我感到几乎要疯了。
Finally, the thing crystallized for me. As long as I did nothing, I felt it was the same as beingdisloyal. I felt that as long as I sat down, I was not helping Mr. Muhammad-when somebodyneeded to be standing up. 
最后，事情对我来说变得清晰了。只要我什么都不做，我就感到这和不忠是一样的。我感到只要我坐下来，我就不是在帮助穆罕默德先生——当有人需要站起来的时候。
So one night I wrote to Mr. Muhammad about the poison being spread about him. He telephonedme in New York. He said that when he saw me he would discuss it.I desperately wanted to find some way-some kind of a bridge-over which I was certain the Nationof Islam could be saved from self-destruction. I had faith in the Nation: we weren't some group ofChristian Negroes, jumping and shouting and full of sins. 
所以有一天晚上，我给穆罕默德先生写了一封信，告诉他有人在散布关于他的毒药。他在纽约给我打了电话。他说当他见到我时会讨论这个问题。我拼命地想找到某种方法——某种桥梁——通过它，我确信伊斯兰民族可以免于自我毁灭。我对这个国家有信心：我们不是一群基督教黑人，跳跃、喊叫、充满罪恶。
I thought of one bridge that could be used if and when the shattering disclosure should becomepublic. Loyal Muslims could be taught that a man's accomplishments in his life outweigh hispersonal, human weaknesses. Wallace Muhammad helped me to review the Quran and the Biblefor documentation. David's adultery with Bathsheba weighed less on history's scales, forinstance, than the positive fact of David's killing Goliath. Thinking of Lot, we think not of incest,but of his saving the people from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Or, our image of Noahisn't of his getting drunk-but of his building the ark and teaching people to save themselves fromthe flood. We think of Moses leading the Hebrews from bondage, not of Moses' adultery with theEthiopian women. In all of the cases I reviewed, the positive outweighed the negative. 
我想到了一座桥梁，如果和当粉碎性的披露成为公众的时候，它可以被使用。忠诚的穆斯林可以被教导一个人在生活中的成就超过了他的个人、人性弱点。华莱士·穆罕默德帮助我回顾了古兰经和圣经作为文献资料。例如，大卫与拔示巴通奸的历史重量比大卫杀死歌利亚的积极事实要轻。
I began teaching in New York Mosque Seven that a man's accomplishments in his life outweighedhis personal, human weaknesses. I taught that a person's good deeds outweigh his bad deeds. Inever mentioned the previously familiar subjects of adultery and fornication, and I nevermentioned immoral evils. 
我开始在纽约的第七清真寺教课，一个人一生中的成就超过了他的个人、人性弱点。我教导说一个人的善行胜过他的恶行。我从未提到以前熟悉的通奸和淫乱的话题，也从未提到不道德的邪恶行为。
By some miracle, the adultery talk which was so widespread in Chicago seemed to only leak alittle in Boston, Detroit, and New York. Apparently, it hadn't reached other mosques around thecountry at all. In Chicago, increasing numbers of Muslims were leaving Mosque Two, I heard, andmany non-Muslims who had been sympathetic to the Nation were now outspokenly anti-Muslim.In February 1963,I officiated at the University of Islam graduation exercises;when I introducedvarious members of the Muhammad family, I could feel the cold chill toward them from theMuslims in the audience. 
通过某种奇迹，在芝加哥如此广泛的通奸话题似乎只在纽约、波士顿和底特律泄露了一点。显然，它根本没有到达全国各地的其他清真寺。我听说，在芝加哥，越来越多的穆斯林正在离开第二清真寺，许多曾经同情这个国家的非穆斯林现在公开反对穆斯林。1963年2月，我在伊斯兰大学主持毕业典礼；当我介绍穆罕默德家族的各种成员时，我可以感受到观众中穆斯林对他们的冷漠。
Elijah Muhammad had me fly to Phoenix to see him in April, 1963. 
伊莱贾·穆罕默德让我在1963年4月飞往菲尼克斯见他。
We embraced, as always-and almost immediately he took me outside, where we began to walkby his swimming pool. 
我们像往常一样拥抱，几乎立刻就带我到外面，开始在他的游泳池边散步。
He was The Messenger of Allah. When I was a foul, vicious convict, so evil that other convictshad called me Satan, this man had rescued me. He was the man who had trained me, who hadtreated me as if I were his own flesh and blood. He was the man who had given me wings-to goplaces, to do things I otherwise never would have dreamed of. We walked, with me caught up in awhirlwind of emotions. 
他是真主的信使。当我还是一个肮脏、邪恶的罪犯，其他罪犯称我为魔鬼时，这个人拯救了我。他是训练我的人，他对待我就像对待自己的亲人一样。他是给我翅膀的人——去到不同的地方，做我从未想过的事情。我们走着，我沉浸在情感的旋风中。
"Well, son," Mr. Muhammad said, "what is on your mind?" 
"好吧，儿子，"穆罕默德先生说，"你在想什么？"
Plainly, frankly, pulling no punches, I told Mr. Muhammad what was being said. And withoutwaiting for any response from him, I said that with his son Wallace's help I had found in the Quranand the Bible that which might be taught to Muslims-if it became necessary-as the fulfillment ofprophecy. 
我直截了当地告诉穆罕默德先生别人在说什么。我没有等他回应，接着说在他儿子华莱士的帮助下，我在古兰经和圣经中找到了一些东西，如果有必要的话，可以教给穆斯林作为预言的实现。
"Son, I'm not surprised," Elijah Muhammad said. "You always have had such a goodunderstanding of prophecy, and of spiritual things. You recognize that's what all of this is- prophecy. You have the kind of understanding that only an old man has. 
"儿子，我并不惊讶，"伊莱贾·穆罕默德说。 "你一直对预言和灵性事物有着很好的理解。你认识到这就是所有这一切的意义——预言。你拥有只有老年人才有的理解力。"
"I'm David," he said. "When you read about how David took another man's wife,  I'm that David.You read about Noah, who got drunk-that's me. You read about Lot, who went and laid up with hisown daughters. I have to fulfill all of those things."*     *     * 
"我是大卫，"他说。 "当你读到关于大卫如何夺取了别人的妻子时，我就是那个大卫。你读到诺亚，他喝醉了——那就是我。
I remembered that when an epidemic is about to hit somewhere, that community's people areinoculated against exposure with some of the same germs that are anticipated-and this preparesthem to resist the oncoming virus. 
我记得当流行病即将袭击某个地方时，该社区的人们会接种一些预计的相同细菌以预防感染——这使他们能够抵抗即将到来的病毒。
I decided I had better prepare six other East Coast Muslim officials whom I selected. 
我决定最好也给其他六位东海岸穆斯林官员准备一些，这些人是我挑选出来的。
I told them. And then I told them why I had told them-that I felt they should not be caught bysurprise and shock if it became their job to teach the Muslims in their mosques the "fulfillment ofprophecy." I found then that some had already heard it; one of them, Minister Louis X of Boston,as much as seven months before. They had been living with the dilemma themselves. 
我告诉了他们。然后我告诉他们为什么我告诉他们——我觉得如果他们的工作是在他们的清真寺里教导穆斯林“预言的实现”，那么他们不应该感到惊讶和震惊。我发现有些人已经听说过了；其中一个人，波士顿的路易斯十世部长，早在七个月前就听过了。他们自己也在与这个困境作斗争。
I never dreamed that the Chicago Muslim officials were going to make it appear that I wasthrowing gasoline on the fire instead of water. I never dreamed that they were going to try tomake it appear that instead of inoculating against an epidemic, I had started it. 
我从未想过芝加哥的穆斯林官员会让事情看起来像是我往火上浇汽油而不是水。我从未想过他们会试图让事情看起来像是我没有接种疫苗来预防流行病，而是我自己引发了它。
The stage in Chicago even then was being set for Muslims to shift their focus off the epidemic- and onto me. 
即使在那时，芝加哥的舞台也在为穆斯林们转移他们的注意力做准备——从流行病转移到我身上。
Hating me was going to become the cause for people of shattered faith to rally around. 
 仇恨我将成为信仰破碎的人们聚集在一起的原因。 
Non-Muslim Negroes who knew me well, and even some of the white reporters with whom I hadsome regular contact, were telling me, almost wherever I went, "Malcolm X, you're looking tired.You need a rest." 
 认识我的非穆斯林黑人，甚至一些我经常接触的白人记者，几乎无论我走到哪里，都在告诉我：“马尔科姆· X ，你看起来很累。你需要休息一下。” 
 They didn't know a fraction of it. Since I had been a Muslim, this was the first time any whitepeople really got to me in a personal way. I could tell that some of them were really honest andsincere. One of these, whose name I won't call-he might lose his job-said, "Malcolm X, the whitesneed your voice worse than the Negroes." I remember so well his saying this because it prefacedthe first time since I became a Muslim that I had ever talked with any white man at any lengthabout anything except the Nation of Islam and the American black man's struggle today. 
 他们不知道其中的一小部分。自从我成为穆斯林以来，这是第一次白人真正以个人的方式接触到我。我可以感觉到其中一些人真的很诚实和真诚。其中一个，我不会说出他的名字——他可能会失去工作——说：“马尔科姆· X ，白人比黑人更需要你的声音。”我记得他说的这么清楚，因为它是自成为穆斯林以来我第一次与任何白人长时间谈论除了伊斯兰国家和美国黑人的斗争之外的任何事情。 
I can't remember how, or why, he somehow happened to mention the Dead Sea Scrolls. I cameback with something like, "Yes, those scrolls are going to take Jesus off the stained-glasswindows and the frescoes where he has been lily-white, and put Him back into the truemainstream of history where Jesus actually was non-white." The reporter was surprised, and Iwent on that the Dead Sea Scrolls were going to reaffirm that Jesus was a member of thatbrotherhood of Egyptian seers called the Essene-a fact already known from Philo, the famousEgyptian historian of Jesus' time. And the reporter and I got off on about two good hours of talkingin the areas of archaeology, history, and religion. It was so pleasant. I almost forgot the heavyworries on my mind-for that brief respite. I remember we wound up agreeing that by the year2000, every schoolchild will be taught the true color of great men of antiquity. 
 我不记得他是怎么或为什么提到死海古卷的。我回答他说：“是的，这些古卷将会把耶稣从彩色玻璃窗和壁画中移除，那里他一直是白人的形象，并将他放回到真实的历史主流中，在那里耶稣实际上不是白人。”记者感到惊讶，我继续说，死海古卷将重申耶稣是埃及预言家兄弟会的成员，这个事实已经从耶稣时代的著名埃及历史学家斐洛那里得知了。我和记者在考古学、历史和宗教等领域进行了大约两个小时的愉快谈话。这让我忘记了沉重的忧虑——因为短暂的喘息。我记得我们最终同意到2000年，每个学童都将被教导古代伟大人物的真实肤色。 
*     *     * 
I've said that I expected headlines momentarily. I hadn't expected the kind which came. 
 我已经说过，我预料到会有头条新闻。但我没有想到会是这样的头条新闻。 
No one needs to be reminded of who got assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. 
没有人需要提醒，1963年11月22日，在德克萨斯州达拉斯市，谁被暗杀了。 
Within hours after the assassination-I am telling nothing but the truth-everyMuslim ministerreceived from Mr. Elijah Muhammad a directive-in fact, _two_ directives. Every minister wasordered to make no remarks at all concerning the assassination. Mr. Muhammad instructed that ifpressed for comment, we should say: "No comment." 
在暗杀后的几个小时内——我所说的都是实话——每一位穆斯林牧师都收到了伊莱贾·穆罕默德先生的指令——事实上，是两份指令。每一位牧师都被命令不要对暗杀发表任何评论。穆罕默德先生指示说，如果被迫发表评论，我们应该说：“无可奉告。” 
During that three-day period where there was no other news to be heard except relating to themurdered President, Mr. Muhammad had a previously scheduled speaking engagement in NewYork at the Manhattan Center. He cancelled his coming to speak, and as we were unable to getback the money already paid for the rental of the center, Mr. Muhammad told me to speak in hisstead. And so I spoke. 
在那三天里，除了与总统有关的消息外，没有听到任何其他消息，穆罕默德先生在纽约曼哈顿中心有一个事先安排好的演讲活动。他取消了演讲，由于我们无法拿回已经支付的中心租金，穆罕默德先生让我代替他演讲。所以我说话了。
Many times since then, I've looked at the speech notes I used that day, which had been preparedat least a week before the assassination. The tide of my speech was "God's Judgment of WhiteAmerica." It was on the theme, familiar to me, of "as you sow, so shall you reap," or how thehypocritical American white man was reaping what he had sowed. 
 从那时起，我多次看过那天的演讲笔记，这份笔记至少在暗杀发生一周前就已经准备好了。我的演讲主题是“上帝对美国白人的审判”。这个主题对我来说很熟悉，即“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”，或者说虚伪的美国白人正在收获他播下的种子。 
The question-and-answer period opened, I suppose inevitably, with someone asking me, "Whatdo you think about President Kennedy's assassination? What is your opinion?" 
问答环节开始了，我想不可避免地，有人问我：“你对肯尼迪总统的暗杀有什么看法？你的意见是什么？” 
Without a second thought, I said what I honestly felt-that it was, as I saw it, a case of "thechickens coming home to roost." I said that the hate in white men had not stopped with the killingof defenseless black people, but that hate, allowed to spread unchecked, finally had struck downthis country's Chief of State. I said it was the same thing as had happened with Medgar Evers,with Patrice Lumumba, with Madame Nhu's husband. 
我毫不犹豫地说出了我真实的想法——在我看来，这是“恶有恶报”的一个例子。
The headlines and the news broadcasts promptly had it: "_Black Muslims' Malcolm X: 'ChickensCome Home to Roost._'" 
头条新闻和广播迅速报道了这一消息：“黑人穆斯林马尔科姆· X : '恶有恶报'。” 
It makes me feel weary to think of it all now. All over America, all over the world, some of theworld's most important personages were saying in various ways, and in far stronger ways than Idid, that America's climate of hate had been responsible for the President's death. But whenMalcolm X said the same thing, it was ominous. 
现在回想起来，这一切让我感到疲惫不堪。在全美国、全世界，一些世界上最重要的人物都在以各种方式——比我更强烈地——说，是美国的仇恨气候导致了总统的死亡。但是当马尔科姆· X 说出同样的话时，这却是不祥之兆。 
My regular monthly visit to Mr. Muhammad was due the next day. Somehow, on the plane, Iexpected something. I've always had this strong intuition. 
我每个月定期去拜访穆罕默德先生，第二天就是约定的日子。不知为什么，在飞机上，我预感到一些事情。我一直有这种强烈的直觉。 
Mr. Muhammad and I embraced each other in greeting. I sensed some ingredient missing fromhis usual amiability. And I was suddenly tense-to me also very significant. For years, I had pridedmyself that Mr. Muhammad and I were so close that I knew how he felt by how I felt. If he wasnervous, I was nervous. If I was relaxed, then I knew he was relaxed. Now, I felt the tension. . . . 
穆罕默德先生和我互相拥抱问候。我感觉到他平常的亲切中缺少了一些东西。我突然感到紧张——对我来说也很重要。多年来，我一直为自己感到自豪，因为穆罕默德先生和我很亲近，我可以通过自己的感受来了解他的感受。如果他紧张，我也会感到紧张。如果我放松，那么我知道他也放松了。现在，我感到紧张……
First we talked of other things, sitting in his living room. Then he asked me, "Did you see thepapers this morning?" 
我们坐在他的起居室里，先聊了些别的事情。然后他问我：“你今天早上看报纸了吗？”
I said, "Yes, sir, I did." 
我说：“是的，先生，我看了。”
"That was a very bad statement," he said. "The country loved this man. The whole country is inmourning. That was very ill-timed. A statement like that can make it hard on Muslims in general." 
“那是非常糟糕的声明，”他说。“这个国家爱戴这个人。整个国家都在哀悼。时机非常不合适。像这样的声明会让一般的穆斯林处境艰难。”
And then, as if Mr. Muhammad's voice came from afar, I heard his words: "I'll have to silence youfor the next ninety days-so that the Muslims everywhere can be disassociated from the blunder." 
然后，仿佛穆罕默德先生的声音从远处传来，我听到了他的话：“在接下来的90天里，我将不得不让你保持沉默——这样各地的穆斯林才能与这个错误划清界限。”
I was numb.But I was a follower of Mr. Muhammad. Many times I had said to my own assistants that anyonein a position to discipline others must be able to take disciplining himself. 
我感到麻木。但我是穆罕默德先生的追随者。我曾经多次对我的助手们说，任何有权惩罚他人的人都必须能够接受惩罚。
I told Mr. Muhammad, "Sir, I agree with you, and I submit, one hundred per cent." 
我对穆罕默德先生说：“先生，我同意你的看法，我完全服从。”
I flew back to New York psychologically preparing myself to tell my Mosque Seven assistants thatI had been suspended-or "silenced." 
我飞回纽约，心理上已经准备好告诉我的清真寺7号助手，我被停职了——或者说“被禁言”了。
But to my astonishment, upon arrival I learned that my assistants already had been informed. 
但令我惊讶的是，到达后我得知我的助手们已经知道了。
What astonished me even more-a telegram had been sent to every New York City newspaperand radio and television station. It was the most quick and thorough publicity job that I had everseen the Chicago officials initiate. 
更令我惊讶的是——一份电报已经发给了纽约市的每一家报纸、广播电台和电视台。这是我见过芝加哥官员发起的最快、最彻底的宣传工作。
Every telephone where I could possibly be reached was ringing. London. Paris. A.P., U.P.I. Everytelevision and radio network, and all of the newspapers were calling. I told them all, "I disobeyedMr. Muhammad. I submit completely to his wisdom. Yes, I expect to be speaking again afterninety days." 
每个我可能被联系到的电话都在响。伦敦、巴黎、美联社、合众国际社……每个电视和广播网络，以及所有的报纸都在打电话。我告诉他们所有人：“我违反了穆罕默德先生的命令。我完全服从他的智慧。是的，我希望在90天后再次发言。”
"_Malcolm X Silenced_!" It was headlines. 
“马尔科姆· X 被禁言！”这是头条新闻。
My first worry was that if a scandal broke for the Nation of Islam within the next ninety days, Iwould be gagged when I could be the most experienced Muslim in dealing with the news mediathat would make the most of any scandal within the Nation. 
我的第一个担忧是，如果在未来的90天内，伊斯兰民族发生了丑闻，我将会被禁言，而那时我可能是最能处理新闻媒体的穆斯林了，这些媒体会最大限度地利用任何在伊斯兰民族中的丑闻。
I learned next that my "silencing" was even more thorough than I had thought.I was not onlyforbidden to talk with the press, I was not even to teach in my own Mosque Seven. 
接下来，我了解到我的“禁言”比我想象的更彻底。我不仅被禁止与媒体交谈，甚至不允许在自己的第七清真寺里教学。
Next, an announcement was made throughout the Nation of Islam that I would be reinstatedwithin ninety days, "_if he submits_." 
接下来，在整个伊斯兰民族中宣布，如果我“服从”，我将在未来的90天内被重新任命。
This made me suspicious-for the first time. I had completely submitted. But, deliberately, Muslimswere being given the impression that I had rebelled. 
这让我产生了怀疑——第一次。我已经完全服从了。但是，故意地，穆斯林们被给了我反叛的印象。
I hadn't hustled in the streets for years for nothing. I knew when I was being set up. 
我多年来在街上的奋斗不是徒劳无功的。我知道当我被陷害时。
Three days later, the first word came to me that a Mosque Seven official who had been one of mymost immediate assistants was telling certain Mosque Seven brothers: "If you knew what theMinister did, you'd go out and kill him yourself ." 
三天后，我听到的第一个消息是，第七清真寺的一位官员曾经是我的最亲密的助手之一，他告诉第七清真寺的一些兄弟们：“如果你们知道部长做了什么，你们就会出去杀了他。”
And then I knew. As any official in the Nation of Islam would instantly have known, any death-talkfor me could have been approved of-if not actually initiated-by only one man. 
然后我知道。正如伊斯兰民族中的任何官员都会立即知道的那样，对我的任何死亡谈话都可能得到一个人的批准——如果不是实际发起的话。
*     *     * 
My head felt like it was bleeding inside. I felt like my brain was damaged. I went to see Dr. LeonaA. Turner, who has been my family doctor for years, who practices in East Elmhurst, Long Island.I asked her to give me a brain examination. 
我的头感觉像在流血。我感觉我的大脑受损了。我去见了多年来一直是我的家庭医生的莱昂娜·A·特纳医生，她在东埃尔姆赫斯特，长岛开了诊所。我请她给我做脑部检查。
She did examine me. She said I was under great strain-and I needed rest. 
她给我做了检查。她说我压力很大——需要休息。
Cassius Clay and I are not together today. But always I must be grateful to himthat at just t histime, when he was in Miami training to fight Sonny Liston, Cassius invited me, Betty, and thechildren to come there as his guests-as a sixth wedding anniversary present to Betty and me. 
卡修斯·克莱和我今天没有在一起。但是我永远感激他，就在那个时候，当他在迈阿密训练准备与桑尼·利斯顿比赛时，卡修斯邀请我和贝蒂以及孩子们作为他的客人到那里去——作为给我和贝蒂的第六个结婚周年纪念日的礼物。
I had met Cassius Clay in Detroit in 1962. He and his brother Rudolph came into the Student'sLuncheonette next door to the Detroit Mosque where Elijah Muhammad was about to speak at abig rally. Every Muslim present was impressed by the bearing and the obvious genuineness of thestriking, handsome pair of prizefighter brothers. Cassius came up and pumped my hand,introducing himself as he later presented himself to the world, "I'm Cassius Clay." He acted as if Iwas supposed to know who he was. So I acted as though I did. Up to that moment, though, I hadnever even heard of him. Ours were two entirely different worlds. In fact, Elijah Muhammadinstructed us Muslims against all forms of sports. 
我在1962年在底特律见过卡修斯·克莱。他和他的兄弟鲁道夫来到底特律清真寺隔壁的学生午餐店，伊利亚·穆罕默德正在那里举行一场大型集会。在场的每一个穆斯林都对这对引人注目的、英俊的拳击手兄弟的气质和明显的真诚印象深刻。卡修斯走过来握住我的手，自我介绍为“我是卡修斯·克莱”，就像他后来向世界介绍自己一样。他表现得好像我应该知道他是谁一样。所以我表现得好像我知道一样。然而，直到那一刻，我甚至从未听说过他。我们生活在两个完全不同的世界中。事实上，伊利亚·穆罕默德教导我们穆斯林要反对各种形式的体育运动。
As Elijah Muhammad spoke, the two Clay brothers practically led the applause, furtherimpressing everyone with their sincerity-since a Muslim rally was about the world's last place toseek fight fans. 
伊利亚·穆罕默德讲话时，克莱兄弟俩几乎领导了全场的掌声，进一步让大家对他们的真诚印象深刻——因为穆斯林集会是世界上最后一个寻找拳击迷的地方。
Thereafter, now and then I heard how Cassius showed up in Muslim mosques and restaurants invarious cities. And if I happened to be speaking anywhere within reasonable distance of whereverCassius was, he would be present. I liked him. Some contagious quality about him made him oneof the very few people I ever invited to my home. Betty liked him. Our children were crazy abouthim. Cassius was simply a likeable, friendly, clean-cut, down-to-earth youngster. I noticed howalert he was even in little details. I suspected that there was a plan in his public clowning. Isuspected, and he confirmed to me, that he was doing everything possible to con and "psyche"Sonny Liston into coming into the ring angry, poorly trained, and overconfident, expecting anotherof his vaunted one-round knockouts. Not only was Cassius receptive to advice, he solicited it.Primarily, I impressed upon him to what a great extent apublic figure's success depends uponhow alert and knowledgeable he is to the true natures and to the true motives of all of the peoplewho flock around him. I warned him about the "foxes," his expression for the aggressive, cuteyoung females who flocked after him; I told Cassius that instead of "foxes," they really werewolves. 
此后，我偶尔听说卡修斯出现在不同城市的穆斯林清真寺和餐馆里。如果我碰巧在卡修斯所在的地方的合理距离内演讲，他就会出席。我喜欢他。他身上有一些传染性的特质，使他成为我邀请到我家来的极少数人之一。贝蒂喜欢他。我们的孩子都为他疯狂。卡修斯只是一个可爱、友好、整洁、脚踏实地的年轻人。我注意到他在小细节上是多么敏锐。我怀疑他的公开滑稽表演是有计划的。我怀疑，他也向我证实，他正在尽一切可能欺骗和“心理”桑尼·利斯顿进入拳击场，愤怒、训练不足、过于自信，期待着他另一个夸耀的一回合击倒对手的胜利。卡修斯不仅接受建议，还主动征求建议。首先，我向他强调一个公众人物的成功在很大程度上取决于他对围绕在他身边的人的真实本质和真实动机的警觉性和知识性。我警告他关于“狐狸”，他用这个词来形容那些对他趋之若鹜的咄咄逼人的漂亮年轻女性；我告诉卡修斯，她们不是“狐狸”，而是狼。
This was Betty's first vacation since we had married. And our three girls romped and played withthe heavyweight contender. 
这是贝蒂和我结婚以来的第一个假期。我们的三个女儿和这位重量级拳击手一起嬉戏玩耍。
I don't know what I might have done if I had stayed in New York during that crucial time-besiegedby insistently ringing telephones, and by the press, and by all of the other people so anxious togloat, to speculate and to "commiserate." 
我不知道如果我留在纽约，在那个关键的时刻——被不断响起的电话铃声、媒体和所有其他急于幸灾乐祸、猜测和“同情”的人包围时，我可能会做什么。
I was in a state of emotional shock. I was like someone who for twelve years had had aninseparable, beautiful marriage-and then suddenly one morning at breakfast the marriage partnerhad thrust across the table some divorce papers. 
我陷入了情感休克的状态。就像一个人12年来拥有一段不可分割的美好婚姻——然后突然有一天早上在吃早餐时，配偶把离婚协议书猛地推到桌子对面。
I felt as though something in _nature_ had failed, like the sun, or the stars. It was that incredible aphenomenon to me-something too stupendous to conceive. I am not sparing myself. AroundCassius Clay's fight camp, around the Hampton House Motel where my family was staying, Italked with my own wife, and with other people, and actually I was only mouthing words that reallymeant nothing to me. W hatever I was saying at any time was being handled by a small corner ofmy mind. The rest of my mind was filled with a parade of a thousand and one different scenesfrom the past twelve years . . . scenes in the Muslim mosques . . . scenes with Mr. Muhammad . .. scenes with Mr. Muhammad's family . . . scenes with Muslims, individually, as my audiences,and at our social gatherings . . . and scenes with the white man in audiences, and the press. 
我感到仿佛自然界的某种东西失败了，比如太阳或星星。对我来说这是一个难以置信的现象——太不可思议了，无法想象。我没有对自己留情。在卡修斯·克莱的拳击训练营周围，在我家人居住的汉普顿旅馆附近，我和我自己的妻子以及其他人交谈，实际上我只是在说着一些对我毫无意义的话。无论我在任何时候说什么，都是由我大脑中的一个小角落处理的。我的头脑中的其他部分充满了过去12年来一千零一个不同的场景的游行……穆斯林清真寺的场景……与穆罕默德先生的场景……与穆罕默德先生的家人的场景……与作为我的观众和在我们的社交聚会上的穆斯林个人的场景……以及白人观众和媒体的场景。
I walked, I talked, I functioned. At the Cassius Clay fight camp, I told the various sportswritersrepeatedly what I gradually had come to know within myself was a lie-that I would be reinstatedwithin ninety days. But I could not yet let myself psychologically face what I knew: that already theNation of Islam and I were physically divorced. Do you understand what I mean? A judge'ssignature on a piece of paper can grant to a couple a physical divorce-but for either of them, ormaybe for both of them, if they have been a very close marriage team, to actually become_psychologically_ divorced from each other might take years. 
我走路、说话、工作。在卡修斯·克莱的拳击训练营里，我向各种体育记者反复讲述了我逐渐认识到自己内心的谎言——我会在90天内被重新任命。但我还不能让自己从心理上面对我所知道的事实：那就是，我已经和伊斯兰国家在身体上离婚了。你明白我的意思吗？法官在一张纸上签字可以授予一对夫妇身体上的离婚——但对于他们中的任何一个人，或者可能是他们两个，如果他们曾经是一对非常亲密的婚姻伴侣，要真正从心理上离婚可能需要数年时间。
But in the physical divorce, I could not evade the obvious strategy and plotting coming out ofChicago to eliminate me from the Nation of Islam . . . if not from this world. And I felt that Iperceived the anatomy of the plotting. 
但在身体上的离婚中，我无法逃避来自芝加哥的明显策略和阴谋，以将我从伊斯兰国家中除名……如果不是从这个世界。我感到我察觉到了阴谋的解剖结构。
Any Muslim would have known that my "chickens coming home to roost" statement had beenonly an excuse to put into action the plan for getting me out. And step one had been alreadytaken: the Muslims were given the impression that I had rebelled against Mr. Muhammad. I couldnow anticipate step two: I would remain "suspended" (and later I would be "isolated") indefinitely.Step three would be either to provoke some Muslim ignorant of the truth to take it upon himself tokill me as a "religious duty"-or to "isolate" me so that I would gradually disappear from the publicscene. 
任何穆斯林都会知道我的“鸡回到巢里”的说法只是一个借口，以实施将我赶出的计划。第一步已经采取了：穆斯林被给了我反叛了穆罕默德先生的印象。我现在可以预测第二步：我将无限期地保持“暂停”（后来会被“孤立”）状态。第三步将是要么煽动一些不了解真相的穆斯林，让他自己把我当作一种“宗教责任”来杀死我——或者让我“孤立”，这样我就会逐渐从公众视野中消失。
The only person who knew was my wife. I never would have dreamed that I would ever dependso much upon any woman for strength as I now leaned upon Betty. There was no exchangebetween us; Betty said nothing, being the caliber of wife that she is, with the depth ofunderstanding that she has-but I could feel the envelopment of her comfort. I knew that she wasas faithful a servant of Allah as I was, and I knew that whatever happened, she was with me. 
唯一知道我的人是我的妻子。我从未想过我会如此依赖任何女人的力量，就像我现在依靠贝蒂一样。我们之间没有交流；贝蒂什么也没说，因为她是一个有深度理解的好妻子——但我可以感受到她的安慰。我知道她和我一样是忠实的真主仆人，而且我知道无论发生什么事情，她都会在我身边。
The death talk was not my fear. Every second of my twelve years with Mr. Muhammad, I hadbeen ready to lay down my life for him. The thing to meworse than death was the betrayal. I couldconceive death. I couldn't conceive betrayal-not of the loyalty which I had given to the Nation ofIslam, and to Mr. Muhammad. During the previous twelve years, if Mr. Muhammad had committedany civil crime punishable by death, I would have said and tried to prove that I did it-to save him- and I would have gone to the electric chair, as Mr. Muhammad's servant. 
死亡谈话不是我所害怕的。我在与穆罕默德先生的十二年中的每一刻，都准备为他献出自己的生命。对我来说比死亡更糟糕的事情是背叛。我可以想象死亡。我不能想象背叛——不是对我给予伊斯兰国家和穆罕默德先生的忠诚的背叛。在过去的十二年中，如果穆罕默德先生犯了任何可判处死刑的民事罪行，我会说出来并试图证明是我做的——为了拯救他——并且作为穆罕默德先生的仆人，我会去电椅上。
There as Cassius Clay's guest in Miami, I tried desperately to push my mind off my troubles andonto the Nation's troubles. I still struggled to persuade myself that Mr. Muhammad had beenfulfilling prophecy. Because I actually had believed that if Mr. Muhammad was not God, then hesurely stood next to God. 
作为卡修斯·克莱在迈阿密的客人，我拼命地试图把我的思想从我的麻烦中转移开，转移到这个国家的麻烦上。我仍然努力说服自己，穆罕默德先生一直在履行预言。因为我真的相信，如果穆罕默德先生不是上帝，那么他肯定站在上帝旁边。
What began to break my faith was that, try as I might, I couldn't hide, I couldn't evade, that Mr.Muhammad, instead of facing what he had done before his followers, as a human weakness oras fulfillment of prophecy-which I sincerely believe that Muslims would have understood, or atleast they would have accepted-Mr. Muhammad had, instead, been willing to hide, to cover upwhat he had done. 
开始打破我的信仰的是，无论我如何努力，我都无法隐藏，无法逃避，穆罕默德先生并没有面对他在追随者面前所做的事情，而是把它当作一种人类的弱点或预言的实现——我真诚地相信穆斯林会理解这一点，或者至少他们会接受这一点——相反，穆罕默德先生愿意隐藏，掩盖他所做的事情。
That was my major blow. 
那是我遭受的重大打击。
That was how I first began to realize that I had believed in Mr. Muhammad more than he believedin himself. 
这就是我最初开始意识到，我比穆罕默德先生更相信自己。
And that was how, after twelve years of never thinking for as much as five minutes about myself, Ibecame able finally to muster the nerve, and the strength, to start facing the facts, to think formyself. 
这就是我如何在十二年中从未花五分钟时间考虑自己之后，最终能够鼓起勇气和力量，开始面对现实，为自己思考。
Briefly I left Florida to return Betty and the children to our Long Island home. I learned that theChicago Muslim officials were further displeased with mebecause of the newspaper reports of mein the Cassius Clay camp. They felt that Cassius hadn't a prayer of a chance to win. They felt theNation would be embarrassed through my linking the Muslim image with him. (I don't know if thechampion today cares to remember that most newspapers in America were represented at thepre-fight camp-except _Muhammad Speaks_. Even though Cassius was a Muslim brother, theMuslim newspaper didn't consider his fight worth covering.) 
简单地说，我离开佛罗里达州，带着贝蒂和孩子回到我们在长岛的家。我得知芝加哥的穆斯林官员对我在卡修斯·克莱营地接受报纸采访的报道更加不满。他们认为卡修斯没有机会赢得比赛。他们觉得通过我与他的关联，伊斯兰国家会感到尴尬。（我不知道今天的冠军是否还记得，美国大多数报纸都派代表参加了战斗前的营地——除了《穆罕默德之声》。即使卡修斯是一个穆斯林兄弟，穆斯林报纸也不认为他的比赛值得报道。）
I flew back to Miami feeling that it was Allah's intent for me to help Cassius prove Islam'ssuperiority before the world-through proving that mind can win over brawn. I don't have to remindyou of how people everywhere scoffed at Cassius Clay's chances of beating Listen. 
我飞回迈阿密，感觉这是真主的旨意，让我帮助卡修斯向世界证明伊斯兰教的优越性——通过证明思想可以战胜肉体。我不需要提醒你，人们到处嘲笑卡修斯·克莱击败利斯顿的机会。
This time, I brought from New York with me some photographs of Floyd Patterson and SonnyListen in their fight camps, with white priests as their "spiritual advisors." Cassius Clay, being aMuslim, didn't need to be told how white Christianity had dealt with the American black man. '"This fight is the truth," I told Cassius. "It's the Cross and the Crescent fighting in a prize ring-forthe first time. It's a modern Crusades-a Christian and a Muslim facing each other with television tobeam it off Telstar for the whole world to see what happens!" I told Cassius, "Do you think Allahhas brought about all this intending for you to leave the ring as anything but the champion?" (Youmay remember that at the weighing-in, Cassius was yelling such things as "It is prophesied forme to be successful!  I cannot be beaten!") 
这次，我从纽约带来了一些弗洛伊德·帕特森和索尼·利斯顿在战斗营地的照片，他们有白人牧师作为他们的“精神顾问”。卡修斯·克莱是一名穆斯林，不需要被告知白人基督教如何对待美国黑人。“这场比赛是真相，”我告诉卡修斯。“十字架和月牙形在拳击场上搏斗——这是第一次。这是一场现代的十字军东征——一个基督徒和一个穆斯林面对面地站着，电视将通过电星传送给全世界观看发生了什么！”我告诉卡修斯，“你认为真主要让你离开拳击场，除了冠军之外还有什么？”（你可能还记得，在称重时，卡修斯大喊大叫，说“我注定会成功！我不能被打败！”）
Sonny Liston's handlers and advisors had him fighting harder to "integrate" than he was trainingto meet Cassius. Liston finally had managed to rent a big, fine house over in a rich, wall-to-wallwhite section. To give you an idea, the owner of the neighboring house was the New YorkYankees baseball club owner, Dan Topping. In the early evenings, when Cassius and I wouldsometimes walk where the black people lived, those Negroes' mouths would hangopen insurprise that he was among them instead of whites as most black champions preferred. Againand again, Cassius startled those Negroes, telling them, "You're my own kind. I get my strengthfrom being around my own black people." 
索尼·利斯顿的经纪人和顾问让他更加努力地“融入”社会，而不是为了迎接卡修斯而训练。利斯顿最终设法在富裕的白人区租了一栋漂亮的大房子。给你一个概念，隔壁房子的主人是纽约扬基棒球俱乐部的老板，丹·托平。傍晚时分，当卡修斯和我有时会走到黑人居住的地方时，那些黑人惊讶地张大了嘴巴，因为他在他们中间而不是大多数黑人冠军更喜欢的白人中间。一次又一次，卡修斯震惊了那些黑人，告诉他们：“你们是我的同类。我的力量来自于我的黑人同胞。”
What Sonny Listen was about to meet, in fact, was one of the most awesome frights that ever canconfront any person-one who worships Allah, and who is completely without fear. 
事实上，索尼·利斯顿即将面对的，是任何敬畏真主、无所畏惧的人所能面对的最可怕的恐惧之一。
Among over eight thousand other seat holders in Miami's big Convention Hall, I received SeatNumber Seven. Seven has always been my favorite number. It has followed me throughout mylife. I took this to be Allah's message confirming to me that Cassius Clay was going to win. Alongwith Cassius, I really was more worried about how his brother Rudolph was going to do, fightinghis first pro fight in the preliminaries. 
在迈阿密大型会议厅的八千多名其他座位持有者中，我得到了七号座位。七一直是我最喜欢的数字。它一直伴随着我一生。我认为这是真主给我的信息，向我证实卡修斯·克莱将会获胜。与卡修斯一起，我真的很担心他的兄弟鲁道夫将如何做，这是他第一次在预赛中参加职业比赛。
While Rudolph was winning a four-round decision over a Florida Negro named "Chip" Johnson,Cassius stood at the rear of the auditorium watching calmly, dressed in a black tuxedo. After all ofhis months of antics, after the weighing-in act that Cassius had put on, this calmness should havetipped off some of the sportswriters who were predicting Clay's slaughter. 
当鲁道夫在四轮比赛中击败一名名叫“芯片”约翰逊的佛罗里达黑人时，卡修斯穿着黑色礼服冷静地站在观众席后面观看。在他所有的滑稽表演之后，在卡修斯举行的称重仪式之后，这种冷静应该会让一些预测克莱将被屠杀的体育记者们有所察觉。
Then Cassius disappeared, dressing to meet Listen. As we had agreed, I joined him in a silentprayer for Allah's blessings. Finally, he and Listen were in their corners in the ring. I folded myarms and tried to appear the coolest man in the place, because a television camera can showyou looking like a fool yelling at a prizefight. 
然后卡修斯消失了，打扮好去迎接利斯顿。按照我们的约定，我加入了他的沉默祈祷，祈求真主的祝福。最后，他和利斯顿在拳击场上的角落里。我双臂交叉，试图成为这个地方最冷静的人，因为电视摄像机可以拍到你像个傻瓜一样大喊大叫。
Except for whatever chemical it was that got into Cassius' eyes and blinded him temporarily in thefourth and fifth rounds, the fight went according to his plan. He evaded Liston's powerful punches.The third round automatically beganthe tiring of the aging Listen, who was overconfidently trainedto go only two rounds. Then, desperate, Listen lost. The secret of one of fight history's greatestupsets was that months before that night, Clay had out-thought Listen. 
除了在第四和第五轮中进入卡修斯眼睛并暂时使他失明的化学物质外，比赛按照他的计划进行。他躲避了利斯顿有力的拳击。第三轮自动开始让年迈的利斯顿感到疲惫不堪，他过于自信地只训练了两轮。然后，绝望的利斯顿输了。这是历史上最伟大的一次翻盘之一的秘密，几个月前的那个晚上，克莱已经想出了利斯顿的招数。
There probably never has been as quiet a new-champion party. The boyish king of the ring cameover to my motel. He ate ice cream, drank milk, talked with football star Jimmy Brown and otherfriends, and some reporters. Sleepy, Cassius took a quick nap on my bed, then he went backhome. 
可能从来没有过这样安静的新冠军派对。这个年轻的拳击王来到我的汽车旅馆。他吃着冰淇淋，喝着牛奶，和足球明星吉米·布朗和其他朋友以及一些记者交谈。卡修斯困了，在我床上小睡了一会儿，然后回家了。
We had breakfast together the next morning, just before the press conference when Cassiuscalmly made the announcement which burst into international headlines that he was a "BlackMuslim." 
第二天早上，在新闻发布会之前，我们一起吃了早餐。卡修斯平静地宣布自己是“黑人穆斯林”，这一消息登上了国际头条新闻。
But let me tell you something about that. Cassius never announced himself a member of any"Black Muslims." The press reporters made that out of what he told them, which was this: "Ibelieve in the religion of Islam, which means I believe there is no God but Allah, and Muhammadis His Apostle. This is the same religion that is believed in by over seven hundred million dark- skinned peoples throughout Africa and Asia." 
但是让我告诉你一些事情。卡修斯从来没有宣布自己是任何“黑人穆斯林”的成员。新闻记者从他告诉他们的话中得出了这个结论，他说：“我信仰伊斯兰教，这意味着我相信除了真主安拉之外没有上帝，穆罕默德是他的使者。这是非洲和亚洲超过7亿黑皮肤人民所信仰的宗教。”
Nothing in all of the furor which followed was more ridiculous than Floyd Patterson announcingthat as a Catholic, he wanted to fight Cassius Clay-to save the heavyweight crown from beingheld by a Muslim. It was such a sad case of a brainwashed black Christian ready to do battle forthe white man-who wants no part of him. Not three weeks later, the newspapers reported that inYonkers, New York, Patterson was offering to sell his $140,000 house for a $20,000 loss. He had"integrated" into a neighborhood of whites who had made his life miserable. None were friendly.Their children called his children "niggers." One neighbor trained his dog to deface Patterson'sproperty. Another erected a fence to hide the Negroes from sight. "I tried, it just didn't work,"Patterson told the press.*     *     * 
在随后的喧嚣中，最荒谬的事情莫过于弗洛伊德·帕特森宣布作为天主教徒，他想要与卡修斯·克莱战斗——从穆斯林手中拯救重量级冠军。这是一个可悲的例子，一个被洗脑的黑人基督徒准备为白人而战——而白人根本不需要他。不到三周后，报纸报道说在纽约扬克斯，帕特森愿意以2万美元的损失出售他的14万美元的房子。他已经“融入”了一个让他的生活变得痛苦的白人社区。没有人是友好的。他们的孩子们称他的孩子们为“黑鬼”。一个邻居训练他的狗去破坏帕特森的财产。另一个竖起一道栅栏来隐藏黑人。“我尝试过了，但没成功，”帕特森告诉媒体。*
The first direct order for my death was issued through a Mosque Seven official who previouslyhad been a close assistant. Another previously close assistant of mine was assigned to do thejob . He was a brother with a knowledge of demolition; he was asked to wire my car to explodewhen I turned the ignition key. But this brother, it happened, had seen too much of my total loyaltyto the Nation to carry out his order. Instead, he came to me . I thanked him for my life. I told himwhat was really going on in Chicago. He was stunned almost beyond belief. 
第一个直接命令我死亡的人是通过一个以前曾是我的亲密助手的清真寺七号官员发出的。另一个我以前的亲密助手被指派去执行这项任务。他是一个懂得爆破的兄弟，他被要求在我转动点火钥匙时引爆我的汽车。但是这个兄弟看到了太多我对国家的忠诚，以至于无法执行他的命令。相反，他来找我。我感谢他救了我的命。我告诉他芝加哥到底发生了什么事。他几乎难以置信地震惊了。
This brother was close to others in the Mosque Seven circle who might subsequently be calledupon to eliminate me. He said he would take it upon himself to enlighten each of them enough sothat they wouldn't allow themselves to be used. 
这个兄弟和清真寺七号圈子里的其他人关系密切，他们可能会被要求消灭我。他说他会亲自去启发他们中的每一个人，让他们不会让自己被利用。
This first direct death-order was how, finally, I began to arrive at my psychological divorce fromthe Nation of Islam. 
这个第一个直接的死亡命令最终让我开始从心理上脱离伊斯兰国家。
I began to see, wherever I went-on the streets, in business places, on elevators, sidewalks, inpassing cars-the faces of Muslims whom I knew, and I knew that any of them might be waiting theopportunity to try and put a bullet into me. 
无论我走到哪里——在街上、在商业场所、在电梯里、在人行道上、在路过的车里——我都能看到我所认识的穆斯林的面孔，我知道他们中的任何一个都可能在等待机会试图向我开枪。
I was racking my brain. What was I going to do? My life was inseparably committed to theAmerican black man's struggle. I was generally regarded as a "leader." For years, I had attackedso many so-called "black leaders" for their shortcomings. Now, I had to honestly ask myself what Icould offer, how I was genuinely qualified to help the black people win their struggle for humanrights. I had enough experience to know that in order to be a good organizer ofanything whichyou expect to succeed-including yourself-you must almost mathematically analyze cold facts. 
我绞尽脑汁。我该怎么办？我的生命与美国黑人的斗争密不可分。我被普遍认为是一个“领袖”。多年来，我一直抨击许多所谓的“黑人领袖”的缺点。现在，我必须诚实地问自己我能提供什么，我真正有资格帮助黑人赢得他们的人权斗争。我有足够的经验知道，要成为一个好组织者，任何你期望成功的事情——包括你自己——你必须几乎用数学分析冷酷的事实。
I had, as one asset, I knew, an international image. No amount of money could have bought that.I knew that if I said something newsworthy, people would read or hear of it, maybe even aroundthe world, depending upon what it was. More immediately, in New York City, where I wouldnaturally base any operation, I had a large, direct personal following of non-Muslims. This hadbeen building up steadily ever since I had led Muslims in the dramatic protest to the police whenour brother Hinton was beaten up. Hundreds of Harlem Negroes had seen, and hundreds ofthousands of them had later heard how we had shown that almost anything could beaccomplished by black men who would face the white man without fear. All of Harlem had seenhow from then on, the police gave Muslims respect. (This was during the time that the DeputyChief Inspector at the 28th Precinct had said of me, "No one man should have that much power.") 
我知道，我有一个国际形象。无论多少钱都买不来的。我知道，如果我说出一些有新闻价值的话，人们会读到或听到它，也许甚至是在世界各地，这取决于它是关于什么的。更直接的是，在纽约市，我自然会把任何行动都建立在这座城市上，我有一大批非穆斯林人士的直接个人追随者。自从我们带领穆斯林在警察殴打我们的兄弟亨顿时进行戏剧性的抗议以来，这种情况一直在稳步增长。数百名哈莱姆黑人看到了，数十万人后来听说了我们如何证明黑人男子可以毫无畏惧地面对白人男子完成几乎任何事情。整个哈莱姆都看到了从那时起，警察对穆斯林的尊重。（这是在第28分局副督察官对我说：“一个人不应该拥有那么大的权力。”）
Over the ensuing years, I'd had various kinds of evidence that a high percentage of New YorkCity's black people responded to what I said, including a great many who would not publicly sayso. For instance, time and again when I spoke at street rallies, I would draw ten and twelve timesas many people as most other so-called "Negro leaders." I knew that in any society, a true leaderis one who earns and deserves the following he enjoys. True followers are bestowed bythemselves, out of their own volition and emotions. I knew that the great lack of most of the big- named "Negro leaders" was their lack of any true rapport with the ghetto Negroes. How couldthey have rapport when they spent most of their time "integrating" with white people? I knew thatthe ghetto people knew that I never left the ghetto in spirit, and I never left it physically any morethan I had to. I had a ghetto instinct; for instance, I could feel if tension was beyond normal in aghetto audience. And I could speak and understand the ghetto's language. There was anexample of this that alwaysflew to my mind every time I heard some of the "big name" Negro"leaders" declaring they "spoke for" the ghetto black people. 
在接下来的几年里，我得到了各种各样的证据，证明纽约市的黑人中有很高比例的人对我所说的话做出了回应，包括许多不会公开说出来的人。例如，每当我在街头集会上演讲时，我会吸引比其他所谓的“黑人领袖”多十倍甚至十二倍的人。我知道在任何社会中，真正的领袖都是那些赢得并值得拥有追随者的人。真正的追随者是出于自愿和情感而自发地给予他们的。我知道大多数著名的“黑人领袖”最大的缺点是他们与贫民窟黑人之间缺乏真正的联系。当他们大部分时间都花在与白人“融合”在一起时，他们怎么可能有联系呢？我知道贫民窟的人们知道我从未离开过贫民窟的精神，而且我从未离开过它的身体，除了我必须这样做的时候。我有贫民窟的本能；例如，我可以感觉到如果贫民窟观众中的紧张情绪超出了正常范围。我可以说和理解贫民窟的语言。每当我听到一些“著名”的黑人“领袖”宣布他们“代表”贫民窟黑人时，我总是想起一个例子。
After a Harlem street rally, one of these downtown "leaders" and I were talking when we wereapproached by a Harlem hustler. To my knowledge I'd never seen this hustler before; he said tome, approximately: "Hey, baby! I dig you holding this all-originals scene at the track . . . I'm goingto lay a vine under the Jew's balls for a dime-got to give you a play . . . Got the shorts out heretrying to scuffle up on some bread . . . Well, my man, I'll get on, got to go peck a little, and cop mesome z's-" And the hustler went on up Seventh Avenue. 
在哈莱姆街头集会后，我和其中一位市中心的“领袖”正在交谈，这时一个哈莱姆的皮条客走近我们。据我所知，我以前从未见过这个皮条客；他对我说：“嘿，宝贝！我喜欢你在赛道上举办这场原创演出……我要花一分钱来给你一场表演……这里的人都很穷，试图争夺一些面包……好吧，我的男人，我会上去，去啄一点，然后睡一会儿……”然后皮条客继续沿着第七大道走去。
I would never have given it another thought, except that this downtown "leader" was standing,staring after that hustler, looking as if he'd just heard Sanskrit. He asked me what had been said,and I told him. The hustler had said he was aware that the Muslims were holding an all-blackbazaar at Rockland Palace, which is primarily a dancehall. The hustler intended to pawn a suit forten dollars to attend and patronize the bazaar. He had very little money but he was trying hard tomake some. He was going to eat, then he would get some sleep. 
我从来没有想过这个问题，除了这个市中心的“领袖”站在那里，盯着那个皮条客，看起来好像他刚刚听到了梵语。他问我说了什么，我告诉他了。皮条客说他知道他在岩石宫举办了一个全黑人市集，那是一个舞厅。皮条客打算把一套衣服当十美元去参加和光顾市集。他几乎没有钱，但他正在努力赚一些。他会吃饭，然后去睡觉。
The point I am making is that, as a "leader," I could talk over the ABC, CBS, or NBCmicrophones, at Harvard or at Tuskegee; I could talk with the so-called "middle class" Negro andwith the ghetto blacks (whom all the other leaders just talked _about_). And because I had been ahustler, I knew better than all whites knew, and better than nearly all of the black "leaders" knew,that actually the most dangerous black man in America was the ghetto hustler. 
我想说的是，作为一名“领导者”，我可以在哈佛或塔斯基吉通过美国广播公司（ABC）、哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）或美国国家广播公司（NBC）的麦克风讲话。我可以与所谓的“中产阶级”黑人和贫民区的黑人交谈（所有其他领导人只是_谈论_）。因为我曾经是个皮条客，所以我比所有的白人都清楚，也比几乎所有的黑人“领袖”都清楚，实际上美国最危险的黑人是贫民区的皮条客。
Why do I say this? The hustler, out there in the ghetto jungles, has less respect for the whitepower structure than any other Negro in North America. The ghetto hustler is internally restrainedby nothing. He has no religion, no concept of morality, no civic responsibility, no fear-nothing. Tosurvive, he is outthere constantly preying upon others, probing for any human weakness like aferret. The ghetto hustler is forever frustrated, restless, and anxious for some "action." Whateverhe undertakes, he commits himself to it fully, absolutely. 
我为什么这么说呢？因为在贫民窟里，皮条客比北美其他任何黑人都更不尊重白人的权力结构。贫民窟里的皮条客没有任何内在的约束。他没有宗教信仰，没有道德观念，没有公民责任，没有恐惧——什么都没有。为了生存，他不断地在外面寻找猎物，像一只雪貂一样探测着人类的弱点。贫民窟里的皮条客永远感到沮丧、不安和焦虑，渴望着一些“行动”。无论他做什么，他都全身心地投入其中，绝对地投入其中。
What makes the ghetto hustler yet more dangerous is his "glamor" image to the school-dropoutyouth in the ghetto. These ghetto teen-agers see the hell caught by their parents struggling to getsomewhere, or see that they have given up struggling in the prejudiced, intolerant white man'sworld. The ghetto teenagers make up their own minds they would rather be like the hustlerswhom they see dressed "sharp" and flashing money and displaying no respect for anybody oranything. So the ghetto youth become attracted to the hustler worlds of dope, thievery,prostitution, and general crime and immorality. 
 使贫民窟里的皮条客更加危险的是他在贫民窟里辍学的年轻人中的“魅力”形象。这些贫民窟的青少年看到他们的父母为了生存而拼命挣扎，或者看到他们在白人的偏见和不容忍的世界里放弃了奋斗。贫民窟的青少年下定决心，他们宁愿像他们看到的穿着时髦、炫耀钱财、对任何人或任何事都不尊重的皮条客一样。因此，贫民窟的年轻人被吸引到了皮条客的世界，包括赌博、盗窃、卖淫以及一般的犯罪和不道德行为。 
It scared me the first time I really saw the danger of these ghetto teen-agers if they are eversparked to violence. One sweltering summer afternoon, I attended a Harlem street rally whichcontained a lot of these teen-agers in the crowd. I had been invited by some "responsible" Negroleaders who normally never spoke to me; I knew they had just used my name to help them drawa crowd. The more I thought about it on the way there, the hotter I got. And when I got on thestand, I just told that crowd in the street that I wasn't really wanted up there, that my name hadbeen used-and I walked off the speaker's stand. 
 当我第一次真正看到这些贫民窟青少年的危险时，我感到非常害怕，如果他们被激发暴力行为的话。一个闷热的夏日午后，我参加了一场哈莱姆街头集会，人群中有很多这样的青少年。我是被一些“负责任”的黑人领袖邀请去的，他们通常从不和我说话；我知道他们只是利用我的名字来帮助他们吸引人群。在去的路上，我越想越生气。当我站在讲台上时，我只是告诉街上的人群，我并不是真的想在那里，我的名字被利用了——然后我从演讲台上走了下来。 
Well, what did I want to do that for? Why, those young, teenage Negroes got upset, and startedmilling around and yelling, upsetting the older Negroes in the crowd. The first thing you knowtraffic was blocked in four directions by a crowd whose mood quickly grew so ugly that I really gotapprehensive. I got up on top of a car and began waving my arms and yelling at them to quietdown. They did quiet, and then I asked them to disperse-and they did. 
 好吧，我为什么要这么做呢？为什么，那些年轻的十几岁的黑人青少年感到不安，开始四处乱转和大喊大叫，使人群中年长的黑人感到不安。你知道第一件事是，人群在四个方向上阻塞了交通，他们的情绪迅速变得如此丑陋，以至于我真的很担心。我爬上一辆车的顶部，开始挥舞手臂并大声喊叫让他们安静下来。他们确实安静了下来，然后我要求他们散开——他们也这样做了。 
This was when it began being said that I was America's only Negro who "couldstop a race riot-orstart one." I don't know if I could do either one. But I know one thing: it had taught me in a veryfew minutes to have a whole lot of respect for the human combustion that is packed among thehustlers and their young admirers who live in the ghettoes where the Northern white man hassealed-off the Negro-away from whites-for a hundred years. 
 这就是当人们开始说我是唯一一个能够“阻止或引发种族骚乱”的美国黑人时。我不知道我是否能做到其中的任何一个。但我知道一件事：这让我非常短的时间内对贫民窟里的皮条客和他们的年轻崇拜者之间的人类燃烧有了更多的尊重，在北方白人封锁了黑人一百年的地方，远离白人。 
The "long hot summer" of 1964 in Harlem, in Rochester, and in other cities, has given an idea ofwhat could happen-and that's all, only an idea. For all of those riots were kept contained withinwhere the Negroes lived. You let any of these bitter, seething ghettoes all over America receivethe right igniting incident, and become really inflamed, and explode, and burst out of theirboundaries into where whites live! In New York City, you let enraged blacks pour out of Harlemacross Central Park and fan down the tunnels of Madison and Fifth and Lexington and ParkAvenues. Or, take Chicago's South Side, an older, even worse slum-you let those Negroes swarmdowntown. You let Washington, D.C.'s festering blacks head down Pennsylvania Avenue. Detroithas already seen a peaceful massing of more than a _hundred thousand_ blacks-think aboutthat. You name the city. Black social dynamite is in Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, LosAngeles . . . the black man's anger is there, fermenting. 
1964年的“漫长炎热的夏天”在哈莱姆、罗切斯特和其他城市发生，让我们了解了可能会发生什么——仅此而已，只是想法。因为所有这些骚乱都局限在黑人居住的地方。如果你让美国各地那些愤怒的贫民窟接受点燃事件的权利，它们就会真的燃起来，爆炸并冲破边界进入白人居住的地方！在纽约市，你让愤怒的黑人从哈莱姆穿过中央公园，扑向麦迪逊、第五大道、列克星敦和公园大道隧道。或者，以芝加哥南部为例，一个更老、更糟糕的贫民窟——你让那些黑人涌入市中心。你让华盛顿特区腐烂的黑人头朝宾夕法尼亚大道走去。底特律已经看到了超过十万名黑人的和平集会——想想看。你可以说出任何一个城市的名字。黑人社会炸弹在克利夫兰、费城、旧金山、洛杉矶......那里的黑人愤怒正在发酵。
*     *     * 
I've strayed off onto some of the incidents and situations which have taught me to respect thedanger in the ghettoes. I had been trying to explain how I honestly evaluated my ownqualifications to be worthy of presenting myself as an independent "leader" among black men. 
我偏离了一些事件和情况，这些事件和情况教会了我在贫民窟中尊重危险。我一直试图解释我如何诚实地评估自己的资格，以使自己成为黑人男子中的独立“领袖”。
In the end, I reasoned that the decision already had been made for me. The ghetto massesalready had entrusted me with an image of leadership among them. I knew the ghetto instinctivelyextends that trust only to one who had demonstrated that he would never sell them out to thewhite man. I not onlyhad no such intention-to sell out was not even in my nature. 
最后，我推断出这个决定已经为我做出了。贫民窟的群众已经将我在他们中的领导形象托付给了我。我知道贫民窟本能地只将这种信任扩展到那些已经证明他永远不会出卖他们给白人的人。我不仅没有这样的意图——出卖甚至不是我的本性。
I felt a challenge to plan, and build, an organization that could help to cure the black man in NorthAmerica of the sickness which has kept him under the white man's heel. 
我感到挑战，计划和建立一个组织，可以帮助治愈北美黑人的病，这种病一直让他处于白人的脚下。
The black man in North America was mentally sick in his cooperative, sheeplike acceptance ofthe white man's culture. 
北美黑人在合作中，像羊一样接受白人的文化，这在心理上是病态的。
The black man in North America was spiritually sick because for centuries he had accepted thewhite man's Christianity-which asked the black so-called Christian to expect no true Brotherhoodof Man, but to endure the cruelties of the white so-called Christians. Christianity had made blackmen fuzzy, nebulous, confused in their thinking. It had taught the black man to think if he had noshoes, and was hungry, "we gonna get shoes and milk and honey and fish fries in Heaven." 
北美黑人在精神上是病态的，因为几个世纪以来，他接受了白人的基督教——要求北美黑人在精神上是病态的，因为几个世纪以来，他接受了白人的基督教——要求黑人所谓的基督徒不要期望真正的人类兄弟情谊，而是要忍受白人所谓的基督徒的残酷。基督教使黑人的思维变得模糊、模糊不清、混乱。它教导黑人思考，如果他没有鞋子，而且饥饿，“我们在天堂会得到鞋子和牛奶、蜂蜜和鱼。”
The black man in North America was economically sick and that was evident in one simple fact:as a consumer, he got less than his share, and as a producer gave _least_. The black Americantoday shows us the perfect parasite image-the black tick under the delusion that he is progressingbecause he rides on the udder of the fat, three-stomached cow that is white America. Forinstance, annually, the black man spends over $3 billion for automobiles, but America containshardly any franchised black automobile dealers. For instance, forty per cent of the expensiveimported Scotch whisky consumed in America goes down the throats of the status-sick blackman; but the only black-owned distilleries are in bathtubs, or in the woods somewhere. Or forinstance-a scandalous shame-in New York City, with over a million Negroes, there aren't twentyblack-owned businesses employing over ten people. It's because black men don't own andcontrol their own community's retail establishments that they can't stabilize their own community.The black man in North America was sickest of all politically. He let the white man divide him intosuch foolishness as considering himself a black "Democrat," a black "Republican," a black"Conservative," or a black "Liberal" . . . when a ten-million black vote bloc could be the decidingbalance of power in American politics, because the white man's vote is almost always evenlydivided. The polls are one place where every black man could fight the black man's cause withdignity, and with the power and the tools that the white man understands, and respects, andfears, and cooperates with. Listen, let me tell you something! If a black bloc committee toldWashington's worst "nigger-hater," "We represent ten million votes," why, that "nigger-hater"would leap up: "Well, how _are_ you? Come on _in_ here!" Why, if the Mississippi black manvoted in a bloc, Eastland would pretend to be more liberal than Jacob Javits-or Eastland wouldnot survive in his office. Why else is it that racist politicians fight to keep black men from thepolls? 
北美黑人在经济上也是病态的，这一点从一个简单事实中就可以看出来：作为消费者，他得到的比份额少；而作为生产者，他给予最少。
Whenever any group can vote in a bloc, and decide the outcome of elections, and it _fails_ to dothis, then that group is politically sick. Immigrants once made Tammany Hall the most powerfulsingle force in American politics. In 1880, New York City's first Irish Catholic Mayor was electedand by 1960 America had its first Irish Catholic President. America's black man, voting as a bloc,could wield an even more powerful force. 
每当任何团体可以以集团投票并决定选举结果时，如果它没有这样做，那么这个团体在政治上就是病态的。移民曾经使塔曼尼协会成为美国政治中最具影响力的单一力量。1880年，纽约市选出了第一位爱尔兰天主教市长，到1960年，美国选出了第一位爱尔兰天主教总统。美国的黑人作为一个集团投票，可以发挥更强大的力量。
U.S. politics is ruled by special-interest blocs and lobbies. What group has a more urgent specialinterest, what group needs a bloc, a lobby, more than the black man? Labor owns one ofWashington's largest non-government buildings-situated where they can literally watch the WhiteHouse-and no political move is made that doesn't involve how Labor feels about it. A lobby gotBig Oil its depletion allowance. The farmer, through his lobby, is the most government-subsidizedspecial-interest group in America today, because a millionfarmers vote, not as Democrats, orRepublicans, liberals, conservatives, but as farmers. 
美国政治被特殊利益集团和游说团体所主导。哪个群体比黑人拥有更紧迫的特殊利益，哪个群体比黑人更需要一个集团、一个游说团体？劳工拥有华盛顿最大的非政府建筑之一——位于他们可以实际监视白宫的地方——并且任何政治行动都涉及劳工对此的感受。一个大的游说团体让石油公司获得了耗竭补贴。农民通过他的游说团体成为今天美国政府补贴最多的特殊利益集团，因为一百万农民投票时不是作为民主党人或共和党人、自由派或保守派，而是作为农民。
Doctors have the best lobby in Washington. Their special-interest influence successfully fights theMedicare program that's wanted, and needed, by millions of other people. Why, there's a BeetGrowers' Lobby! A W heat Lobby! A Cattle Lobby! A China Lobby! Little countries no one everheard of have their Washington lobbies, representing their special interests. 
医生在华盛顿拥有最好的游说团体。他们的特殊利益影响力成功地抵制了数百万其他人想要和需要的医疗保险计划。为什么？因为有一个甜菜种植者游说团体！一个小麦种植者游说团体！一个养牛业游说团体！一个中国游说团体！从未听说过的小国家也有他们在华盛顿的游说团体，代表他们的特殊利益。
The government has departments to deal with the special-interest groups that make themselvesheard and felt. A Department of Agriculture cares for the fanners' needs. There is a Department ofHealth, Education and Welfare. There is a Department of the Interior-in which the Indians areincluded. Is the farmer, the doctor, the Indian, the greatest problem in America today? No-it is theblack man! There ought to be a Pentagon-sized Washington department dealing with everysegment of the black man's problems.Twenty-two million black men! They have given America four hundred years of toil; they have bledand died in every battle since the Revolution; they were in America before the Pilgrims, and longbefore the mass immigrations-and they are still today at the bottom of everything! 
政府有部门来处理那些让自己被听到和感受到的特殊利益团体。农业部关心农民的需求。有一个卫生、教育和福利部。有一个内政部——其中包括印第安人。农民、医生、印第安人是美国今天最大的问题吗？不，是黑人！应该有一个巨大的五角大楼规模的华盛顿部门来处理黑人问题的每个部分。2200万黑人！他们为美国付出了400年的劳动；他们在独立战争以来的每一场战斗中流血并死亡；他们在朝圣者之前就在美国，而且在大规模的移民之前很久——而今天他们仍然处于最底层！
Why, twenty-two million black people should tomorrow give a dollar apiece to build a skyscraperlobby building in Washington, D.C. Every morning, every legislator should receive acommunication about what the black man in America expects and wants and needs. Thedemanding voice of the black lobby should be in the ears of every legislator who votes on anyissue. 
为什么，2200万黑人应该明天每人给一美元来建造华盛顿特区的一座摩天大楼。每天早上，每个立法者都应该收到一份关于美国黑人期望、需要和想要的信息。黑人游说团体的要求应该被每一个投票决定任何问题的立法者听到。
The cornerstones of this country's operation are economic and political strength and power. Theblack man doesn't have the economic strength-and it will take time for him to build it. But rightnow the American black man has the political strength and power to change his destiny overnight. 
这个国家运作的基石是经济和政治实力。黑人没有经济实力——这需要时间来建立。但现在美国黑人拥有改变命运的政治力量和权力。
*     *     * 
It was a big order-the organization I was creating in my mind, one which would help to challengethe American black man to gain his human rights, and to cure his mental, spiritual, economic, andpolitical sicknesses. But if you ever intend to do anything worthwhile, you have to start with aworthwhile plan. 
这是一个庞大的组织——我在脑海中创造的组织，它将有助于挑战美国黑人获得人权，并治愈他们的精神、精神、经济和政治疾病。但是，如果你曾经打算做任何有价值的事情，你必须从一个有价值的计划开始。
Substantially, as I saw it, the organization I hoped to build would differ from the Nation of Islam inthat it would embrace all faiths of black men, and it would carry into practice what the Nation ofIslam had only preached. 
基本上，正如我所看到 ，我希望建立的组织将不同于伊斯兰国家，因为它将拥抱所有黑人的信仰，并将实践伊斯兰国家所宣扬的东西。
Rumors were swirling, particularly in East Coast cities-what was I going to do? Well, the first thingI was going to have to do was to attract far more willing heads and hands than my own. Each day,more militant, action brothers who had been with me in Mosque Seven announced their breakfrom the Nation of Islam to come with me. And each day, I learned, in one or another way, of moresupport from non-Muslim Negroes, including a surprising lot of the "middle" and "upper class"black bourgeoisie, who were sick of the status-symbol charade. There was a growing clamor:"When are you going to call a meeting, to get organized?" 
谣言四起，尤其是在东海岸的城市——我该怎么办？好吧，我要做的第一件事就是吸引更多的人加入我的组织。每天，更多比我更激进的行动兄弟宣布脱离伊斯兰国家与我一起前进。而且每天，我以某种方式了解到更多来自非穆斯林黑人的支持，包括许多令人惊讶的“中产阶级”和“上层阶级”的黑人资产阶级，他们厌倦了这种地位象征的闹剧。越来越多的人开始大声疾呼：“你什么时候召集会议，组织起来？”
To hold a first meeting, I arranged to rent the Carver Ballroom of the Hotel Theresa, which is atthe corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, which might be called one of Harlem's fuse-boxlocations. 
为了召开第一次会议，我安排在位于125街和第七大道拐角处的特里萨旅馆的卡弗舞厅里举行。这里也许可以被称为哈莱姆区的一个熔断器位置。
The _Amsterdam News_ reported the planned meeting and many readers inferred that we wereestablishing our beginning mosque in the Theresa. Telegrams and letters and telephone callscame to the hotel for me, from across the country. Their general tone was that this was a movethat people had waitedfor. People I'd never heard of expressed confidence in me in moving ways. 
《阿姆斯特丹新闻》报道了这次计划中的会议，许多读者推断我们将在特里萨旅馆建立我们的第一个清真寺。电报、信件和电话从全国各地打到旅馆找我。他们的总体语气是，这是人们期待已久的举动。我从未听说过的人们以令人感动的方式表达了对我行动的信心。
Numerous people said that the Nation of Islam's stringent moral restrictions had repelled them- and they wanted to join me. 
许多人说，伊斯兰国家的严格的道德限制已经排斥了他们-他们想加入我。
A doctor who owned a small hospital telephoned long-distance to join. Many others sentcontributions-even before our policies had been publicly stated. Muslims wrote from other citiesthat they would join me, their remarks being generally along the lines that "Islam is too inactive" . .."The Nation is moving too slow." 
一个拥有一家小医院的医生打长途电话要加入我们。还有许多人寄来了捐款——甚至在我们公开发表政策之前。来自其他城市的穆斯林写道，他们会加入我，他们的言论大致是“伊斯兰教太不活跃了” …… “这个国家行动太慢了”。
Astonishing numbers of white people called, and wrote, offering contributions, or asking could_they_ join? The answer was, no, they couldn't join; our membership was all black-but if theirconsciences dictated, they could financially help our constructive approach to America's raceproblems. 
令人惊讶的是，许多白人打电话或写信表示愿意捐款，或者问他们是否可以加入？答案是不可以，他们不能加入；我们的会员都是黑人——但如果他们的良心驱使他们，他们可以在经济上帮助我们对美国的种族问题采取建设性的方法。
Speaking-engagement requests came in-twenty-two of them in one particular Monday morning'smail. It was startling to me that an unusual number of the requests came from groups of whiteChristian ministers. 
演讲邀请纷至沓来——仅一个周一早上的邮件中就有22个。让我吃惊的是，这些邀请中有相当一部分来自白人基督教牧师团体。
I called a press conference. The microphones stuck up before me. The flashbulbs popped. Thereporters, men and women, white and black, representing media that reached around the world,sat looking at me with their pencils and open notebooks. 
我召开了一个新闻发布会。麦克风在我面前竖起来。闪光灯闪烁着。记者们，男人和女人，白人和黑人，代表世界各地的媒体，坐在那里看着我，手里拿着铅笔和打开的笔记本。
I made the announcement: "I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York Cityknown as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This will give us a religious base, and the spiritual forcenecessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. 
我宣布：“我将组织并领导纽约市一个新的清真寺，名为穆斯林清真寺有限公司。这将为我们提供一个宗教基地，以及消除摧毁我们社区道德纤维的邪恶的精神力量。”
"Muslim Mosque, Inc. will have its temporary headquarters in the HotelTheresa in Harlem. It willbe the working base for an action program designed to eliminate the political oppression, theeconomic exploitation, and the social degradation suffered daily by twenty-two million Afro- Americans." 
“穆斯林清真寺有限公司将在哈莱姆的特里萨旅馆设立临时总部。它将是一个行动方案的工作基地，旨在消除2200万非裔美国人每天遭受的政治压迫、经济剥削和社会退化。”
Then the reporters began firing questions at me. 
然后记者们开始向我提出问题。
*     *     * 
It was not all as simple as it may sound. I went few places without constant awareness that anynumber of my former brothers felt they would make heroes of themselves in the Nation of Islam ifthey killed me. I knew how Elijah Muhammad's followers thought; I had taught so many of them tothink. I knew that no one would kill you quicker than a Muslim if he felt that's what Allah wantedhim to do. 
事情并不像听起来那么简单。我去了一些地方，但我并没有意识到我的许多前兄弟们认为如果他们杀了我，他们将成为伊斯兰国家的英雄。我知道伊莱贾·穆罕默德的追随者们是怎么想的；我曾经教过他们中的许多人如何思考。我知道如果一个穆斯林觉得他是真主阿拉想要他这么做的话，没有人会比你更快地杀了你。
There was one further major preparation that I knew I needed. I'd had it in my mind for a longtime-as a servant of Allah. But it would require money that I didn't have. 
还有一项重大准备工作我知道自己需要。作为真主阿拉的仆人，我已经考虑了很长时间。但这需要钱，而我没有。
I took a plane to Boston. I was turning again to my sister Ella. Though at times I'd made Ellaangry at me, beneath it all, since I had first come to her as a teen-aged hick from Michigan, Ellahad never once really wavered from my corner. 
我乘飞机去了波士顿。我又去找我的妹妹艾拉。尽管有时我使艾拉生我的气，但在这一切之下，自从我第一次作为一个来自密歇根州的少年来到她身边以来，艾拉从未真正动摇过我的立场。
"Ella," I said, "I want to make the pilgrimage to Mecca." 
“艾拉，”我说，“我想去麦加朝圣。”
Ella said, "How much do you need?" 
艾拉说：“你需要多少钱？”
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
第十七章 
MECCA 
麦加
The pilgrimage to Mecca, known as Hajj, is a religious obligation that every orthodox Muslimfulfills, if humanly able, at least once in his or her lifetime. 
朝觐麦加，被称为哈吉，是一项宗教义务，每个正统的穆斯林履行，如果人类能够至少在他的或她一生中一次。
The Holy Quran says it, "Pilgrimage to the Ka'ba is a duty men owe to God; those who are able,make the journey." 
古兰经说， "朝觐克尔白是人对真主的义务；有能力的人，就应当去旅行。"
Allah said: "And proclaim the pilgrimage among men; they will come to you on foot and uponeach lean camel, they will come from every deep ravine." 
安拉说："你当向众人宣布朝觐；他们就会从每一个山谷里徒步或骑着瘦驼赶来。"
At one or another college or university, usually in the informal gatherings after I had spoken,perhaps a dozen generally white-complexioned people would come up to me, identifyingthemselves as Arabian, Middle Eastern or North African Muslims who happened to be visiting,studying, or living in the United States. They had said to me that, my white-indicting statementsnotwithstanding, they felt that I was sincere in considering myself a Muslim-and they felt if I wasexposed to what they always called "true Islam," I would "understand it, and embrace it."Automatically, as a follower of Elijah Muhammad, I had bridled whenever this was said. 
在一所或另一所学院或大学，通常是在我发表演讲后的非正式聚会中，大约有十几个通常面色白皙的人会来找我，他们自称是碰巧正在访问、学习或居住在美国的阿拉伯、中东或北非穆斯林。他们对我说，尽管我指责白人的声明，但他们觉得我是真诚地认为自己是一名穆斯林——他们觉得如果我接触到他们一直称之为“真正的伊斯兰教”的东西，我会“理解并接受它”。作为以利亚·穆罕默德的追随者，每当有人这样说时，我都会不自觉地感到愤怒。
But in the privacy of my own thoughts after several of these experiences, I did question myself: ifone was sincere in professing a religion, why should he balk at broadening his knowledge of thatreligion? 
但在经历了几次这样的经历后，我在自己的内心深处确实曾经问过自己：如果一个人真诚地信仰一种宗教，那他为什么要回避扩大对该宗教的了解呢？
Once in a conversation I broached this with Wallace Muhammad, Elijah Muhammad's son. Hesaid that yes, certainly, a Muslim should seek to learn all that he could about Islam. I had alwayshad a high opinion of Wallace Muhammad's opinion. 
有一次，在一次谈话中，我向伊莱贾·穆罕默德的儿子华莱士·穆罕默德提出了这个问题。他说，是的，当然，一个穆斯林应该努力学习关于伊斯兰教的一切。我一直对华莱士·穆罕默德的观点评价很高。
Those orthodox Muslims whom I had met, one after another, had urged me tomeet and talk with aDr. Manmoud Youssef Shawarbi. He was described to me as an eminent, learned Muslim, aUniversity of Cairo graduate, a University of London Ph.D., a lecturer on Islam, a United Nationsadvisor and the author of many books. He was a full professor of the University of Cairo, on leavefrom there to be in New York as the Director of the Federation of Islamic Associations in theUnited States and Canada. Several times, driving in that part of town, I had resisted the impulseto drop in at the F.I.A. building, a brown-stone at 1 Riverside Drive. Then one day Dr. Shawarbiand I were introduced by a newspaperman. 
那些我一个接一个遇到的正统派穆斯林敦促我去会见并和Manmoud Youssef Shawarbi博士谈谈。他被描述给我听为一位杰出的、博学的穆斯林，开罗大学的毕业生，伦敦大学的哲学博士，伊斯兰教的讲师，联合国的顾问以及许多书的作者。他是开罗大学的正教授，从那里请假到纽约担任美国和加拿大伊斯兰协会联合会的主任。有好几次，我开车经过那一带时，都忍住了去拜访FIA大楼(位于Riverside Drive 1号)的冲动。后来有一天，Shawarbi博士和我在一位新闻记者的介绍下见了面。
He was cordial. He said he had followed me in the press; I said I had been told of him, and wetalked for fifteen or twenty minutes. We both had to leave to make appointments we had, when hedropped on me something whose logic never would get out of my head. He said, "No man hasbelieved perfectly until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself." 
他非常热情。他说他在新闻上关注过我；我说我也听说过他，我们聊了十五到二十分钟。我们都不得不离开去赴约，这时他对我说了一句话，这句话的逻辑让我终生难忘。他说："除非一个人希望他的兄弟得到他所希望的，否则他就不会完全相信上帝。"
Then, there was my sister Ella herself. I couldn't get over what she had done. I've said before,this is a _strong_, big, black, Georgia-born woman. Her domineering ways had gotten her put outof the Nation of Islam's Boston Mosque Eleven; they took her back, then she left on her own. Ellahad started studying under Boston orthodox Muslims, then she founded a school where Arabicwas taught! _She_ couldn't speak it, she hired teachers who did. That's Ella! She deals in realestate, and _she_ was saving up to make the pilgrimage. Nearly all night, we talked in her livingroom. She told me there was no question about it; it was more important that I go. I thought aboutElla the whole flight back to New York. A _strong_ woman. She had broken the spirits of threehusbands, more driving and dynamic than all of them combined. She had played a verysignificant role in my life. No other woman ever was strong enough to point me in directions; Ipointed women in directions. I had brought Ella into Islam, and now she was financing me toMecca. 
然后，还有我的妹妹艾拉自己。我无法理解她所做的事情。我之前说过，她是一个坚强、高大、黑色皮肤的乔治亚州出生的女人。她的专横方式让她被赶出了伊斯兰国家波士顿清真寺11号；他们把她带了回去，然后她自己离开了。艾拉开始在波士顿正统穆斯林的指导下学习，然后她创办了一所学校教授阿拉伯语！她自己不会说，她雇佣了会说的老师。这就是艾拉！她从事房地产业，而且她自己也在存钱去朝觐。几乎整晚，我们在她家的客厅里交谈。她告诉我这是毫无疑问的；更重要的是我应该去。整个飞回纽约的航班上，我一直在想艾拉。一个坚强的女人。她已经打破了三个丈夫的精神，比他们所有人加起来都更有动力和活力。她在我生命中扮演了一个非常重要的角色。没有其他女人曾经足够坚强地指引我的方向；我指引女性的方向。我已经让艾拉加入了伊斯兰教，现在她又在资助我去麦加朝圣。
 Allah always gives you signs, when you are with Him, that He is with you. 
真主总是给你迹象，当你与他在一起时，他与你同在。
When I applied for a visa to Mecca at the Saudi Arabian Consulate, the Saudi Ambassador toldme that no Muslim converted in America could have a visa for the Hajj pilgrimage without thesigned approval of Dr. Manmoud Shawarbi. But that was only the beginning of the sign fromAllah. When I telephoned Dr. Shawarbi, he registered astonishment. "I was just going to get intouch with you," he said, "by all means come right over." 
当我在沙特阿拉伯领事馆申请去麦加朝圣的签证时，沙特大使告诉我，没有穆罕默德·优素福·沙尔比博士的签名批准，任何在美国皈依的穆斯林都不能获得哈吉朝圣的签证。但这只是真主的迹象的开始。当我打电话给Shawarbi博士时，他感到非常惊讶。“我正准备和你联系，”他说，“无论如何，请立即过来。”
When I got to his office, Dr. Shawarbi handed me the signed letter approving me to make the Hajjin Mecca, and then a book. It was _The Eternal Message of Muhammad_ by Abd-Al-RahmanAzzam. 
当我到达他的办公室时，Shawarbi博士递给我一封批准我去麦加朝圣的签名信，然后是一本书。它是Abd - Al - Rahman Azzam所写的《 Muhammad永恒的信息》。
The author had just sent the copy of the book to be given to me, Dr. Shawarbi said, and heexplained that this author was an Egyptian-born Saudi citizen, an international statesman, andone of the closest advisors of Prince Faisal, the ruler of Arabia. "He has followed you in the pressvery closely." It was hard for me to believe. 
作者刚刚寄送了这本书的副本给我，Shawarbi博士说，他解释说这位作者是一个出生在埃及的沙特公民，一位国际政治家，也是阿拉伯统治者费萨尔亲王最亲密的顾问之一。“他一直在密切关注你在媒体上的动向。”这让我很难相信。
Dr. Shawarbi gave me the telephone number of his son, Muhammad Shawarbi, a student inCairo, and also the number of the author's son, Omar Azzam, who lived in Jedda, "your last stopbefore Mecca. Call them both, by all means." 
Shawarbi博士给了我他儿子Muhammad Shawarbi在开罗读书时的电话号码，以及Shawarbi博士给了我他儿子Muhammad Shawarbi在开罗读书时的电话号码，以及作者的儿子Omar Azzam在Jedda的电话号码，“那是你前往麦加之前的最后一站。无论如何，给他们都打个电话。”
I left New York quietly (little realizing that I was going to return noisily). Few people were told Iwas leaving at all. I didn't want some State Department or other roadblocks put in my path at thelast minute. Only my wife, Betty, and my three girls and a few close associates came with me toKennedy International Airport. When the Lufthansa Airlines jet had taken off, my two seatrowmates and I introduced ourselves. Another sign! Both were Muslims, one was bound for Cairo, asI was, and the other was bound for Jedda, where I would be in a few days.All the way to Frankfurt, Germany, my seatmates and I talked, or I read the book I had beengiven. When we landed in Frankfurt, the brother bound for Jedda said his warm good-bye to meand the Cairo-bound brother. We had a few hours' layover before we would take another plane toCairo. We decided to go sightseeing in Frankfurt. 
我悄悄地离开了纽约（几乎没有意识到我会再次喧闹地回来）。很少有人知道我要离开。我不想在最后一刻被国务院或其他路障拦住。只有我的妻子贝蒂、我的三个女儿和几个亲密的同事和我一起来到肯尼迪国际机场。当汉莎航空公司的飞机起飞时，我和我的两个座位上的同伴互相介绍了自己。这是另一个迹象！他们都是穆斯林，一个和我要去开罗，另一个和我几天后要去的吉达有关。
在我们到达德国法兰克福之前，我和我的座位上的同伴一直在聊天，或者我看了那本书。当我们降落在法兰克福时，前往吉达的兄弟热情地向我和开罗的兄弟告别。我们在乘坐另一架飞机去开罗之前有几个小时的停留时间。我们决定去法兰克福观光。
In the men's room there at the airport, I met the first American abroad who recognized me, awhite student from Rhode Island. He kept eyeing me, then he came over. "Are you X?" I laughedand said I was, I hadn't ever heard it that way. He exclaimed, "You can't be! Boy, I know no onewill believe me when I tell them this!" He was attending school, he said, in France. 
在机场的男洗手间里，我遇到了第一个在国外认出我的美国人，一个来自罗德岛的白人学生。他一直盯着我看，然后走了过来。“你是X吗？”我笑了，说是的，我从没听过这样的称呼。他惊叹道：“不可能！孩子，我知道没有人会相信我！”他说他在法国上学。
The brother Muslim and I both were struck by the cordial hospitality of the people in Frankfurt. Wewent into a lot of shops and stores, looking more than intending to buy anything. We'd walk in,any store, every store, and it would be Hello! People who never saw you before, and knew youwere strangers. And the same cordiality when we left, without buying anything. In America, youwalk in a store and spend a hundred dollars, and leave, and you're still a stranger. Both you andthe clerks act as though you're doing each other a favor. Europeans act more human, or humane,whichever the right word is. My brother Muslim, who could speak enough German to get by,would explain that we were Muslims, and I saw something I had already experienced when I waslooked upon as a Muslim and not as a Negro, right in America. People seeing you as a Muslimsaw you as a human being and they had a different look, different talk, everything. In oneFrankfurt store-a little shop, actually-the storekeeper leaned over his counter to us and waved hishand, indicating the German people passing by: "This way one day, that way another day-" MyMuslim brother explained to me that what he meant was that the Germans would rise again. 
我和那位穆斯林兄弟都被法兰克福人的热情好客所感动。我们走进很多商店和店铺，看起来比打算买任何东西更有意思。我们会走进任何一家商店，每家商店都会说“你好！”那些从未见过你的人知道你是陌生人。当我们离开时，即使没有买东西，他们也同样热情。在美国，你走进一家商店，花了一百美元，然后离开了，你仍然是一个陌生人。你和店员们的行为就好像你们在互相帮忙一样。欧洲人表现得更像人类，或者说更有人情味，无论哪个词更准确。我的穆斯林兄弟会说足够多的德语来应付，他会解释说我们是穆斯林，我看到了一些我已经经历过的事情，当我被看作是一个穆斯林而不是一个黑人的时候，就在美洲。当人们看到你是穆斯林时，他们会把你当作一个人看待，他们的表情、谈话方式都不同。在法兰克福的一家小店里——实际上是一家小店——店主俯身向我们挥手，指着路过的德国人说：“今天这样走，明天那样走——”我的穆斯林兄弟向我解释说，他的意思是德国人会再次崛起。
 Back at the Frankfurt airport, we took a United Arab Airlines plane on to Cairo. Throngs ofpeople, obviously Muslims from everywhere, bound on the pilgrimage, were hugging andembracing. They were of all complexions, the whole atmosphere was of warmth and friendliness.The feeling hit me that there really wasn't any color problem here. The effect was as though I hadjust stepped out of a prison. 
回到法兰克福机场，我们乘坐阿拉伯联合航空公司的飞机前往开罗。成群的人，显然是来自各地的穆斯林，前往朝圣，互相拥抱。他们肤色各异，整个气氛温暖友好。这种感觉击中了我，这里真的没有任何肤色问题。这种感觉就像我刚从监狱里走出来一样。
I had told my brother Muslim friend that I wanted to be a tourist in Cairo for a couple of daysbefore continuing to Jedda. He gave me his number and asked me to call him, as he wanted toput me with a party of his friends, who could speak English, and would be going on thepilgrimage, and would be happy to look out for me. 
我已经告诉我的穆斯林兄弟朋友，我想在开罗做几天游客，然后再继续前往吉达。他给了我他的号码，让我给他打电话，因为他想把我介绍给他的一些朋友，他们会说英语，也会去朝圣，会很乐意照顾我。
So I spent two happy days sightseeing in Cairo. I was impressed by the modern schools, housingdevelopments for the masses, and the highways and the industrialization that I saw. I had readand heard that President Nasser's administration had built up one of the most highlyindustrialized countries on the African continent. I believe what most surprised me was that inCairo, automobiles were being manufactured, and also buses. 
所以我在开罗度过了愉快的两天观光。现代化的学校、为大众建造的住宅区、高速公路和工业化给我留下了深刻的印象。我曾阅读和听说纳赛尔总统的政府已经建立了非洲大陆上最高度工业化的国家之一。我相信最令我惊讶的是，在开罗，汽车和公共汽车都在制造中。
I had a good visit with Dr. Shawarbi's son, Muhammad Shawarbi, a nineteen-year-old, who wasstudying economics and political science at Cairo University. He told me that his father's dreamwas to build a University of Islam in the United States. 
我和Shawarbi博士的儿子Muhammad Shawarbi进行了一次愉快的交谈，他是一位19岁的学生，正在开罗大学学习经济学和政治学。他告诉我，他父亲的梦想是在美国建立一所伊斯兰大学。
The friendly people I met were astounded when they learned I was a Muslim-from America! Theyincluded an Egyptian scientist and his wife, also on their way to Mecca for the Hajj, who insisted Igo with them to dinner in a restaurant in Heliopolis, a suburb of Cairo. They were an extremelywell-informed and intelligent couple. Egypt's rising industrialization was one of the reasons whythe Western powers were so anti-Egypt, it was showing otherAfrican countries what they shoulddo, the scientist said. His wife asked me, "Why are people in the world starving when Americahas so much surplus food? What do they do, dump it in the ocean?" I told her, "Yes, but they putsome of it in the holds of surplus ships, and in subsidized granaries and refrigerated space andlet it stay there, with a small army of caretakers, until it's unfit to eat. Then another army ofdisposal people get rid of it to make space for the next surplus batch." She looked at me insomething like disbelief. Probably she thought I was kidding. But the American taxpayer knowsit's the truth. I didn't go on to tell her that right in the United States, there are hungry people. 
当我遇到的友好的人们知道我来自美国时，他们感到非常惊讶。其中包括一位埃及科学家和他的妻子，他们也在前往麦加朝圣的路上，坚持让我和他们一起去开罗郊区的赫利奥波利斯的一家餐厅用餐。他们是一对非常有见识和聪明的夫妇。埃及日益工业化是西方列强如此反埃及的原因之一，它向其他非洲国家展示了他们应该做什么，科学家说。他的妻子问我：“为什么当美国有这么多剩余食物时，世界上还有人在挨饿？他们做了什么，把它倒进海里吗？”我告诉她：“是的，但是他们把其中一些放在剩余船只的货舱里，以及补贴的谷仓和冷藏空间里，让它留在那里，由一小队看护人员照管，直到它不适合食用。然后另一支处理人员的队伍将其丢弃以腾出空间给下一批剩余的食物。”她看着我，好像不太相信我说的话。也许她认为我在开玩笑。但是美国的纳税人知道这是真的。我没有继续告诉她在美国境内也有饥饿的人。
I telephoned my Muslim friend, as he had asked, and the Hajj party of his friends was waiting forme. I made it eight of us, and they included a judge a nd an official of the Ministry of Education.They spoke English beautifully, and accepted me like a brother. I considered it another of Allah'ssigns, that wherever I turned, someone was there to help me, to guide me. 
我按照他的要求给我的穆斯林朋友打了电话，他的朋友们正在等待我。我们一共有八个人，其中包括一位法官和教育部的一位官员。他们英语说得很好，像兄弟一样接纳了我。我认为这是安拉的另一个迹象，无论我转向哪里，总有人在那里帮助我、指引我。

The literal meaning of Hajj in Arabic is to set out toward a definite objective. In Islamic law, itmeans to set out for Ka'ba, the Sacred House, and to fulfill the pilgrimage rites. The Cairo airportwas where scores of Hajj groups were becoming Muhrim, pilgrims, upon entering the state ofIhram, the assumption of a spiritual and physical state of consecration. Upon advice, I arrangedto leave in Cairo all of my luggage and four cameras, one a movie camera. I had bought in Cairoa small valise, just big enough to carry one suit, shirt, a pair of underwear sets and a pair ofshoes into Arabia. Driving to the airport with our Hajj group, I began to get nervous, knowing thatfrom there in, it was going to be watching others who knew what they were doing, and trying to dowhat they did. 
哈吉在阿拉伯语中的字面意思是朝着一个确定的目标出发。在伊斯兰法律中，它意味着前往圣屋卡巴，并履行朝觐仪式。开罗机场是数十个哈吉团体成为穆赫林（Muhrim），即进入精神与身体净化状态的朝圣者的地方。根据建议，我安排将所有行李和四台相机留在开罗，其中一台是电影摄像机。我在开罗买了一个小手提箱，大小刚好可以装进一套西装、衬衫、两套内衣和一双鞋子，然后进入阿拉伯地区。我们哈吉团体开车去机场时，我开始感到紧张，因为从这里开始，我将需要观察其他人的行动，并尝试模仿他们的行为。
Entering the state of Ihram, we took off our clothes and put on two white towels. One, the _Izar_,was folded around the loins. The other, the _Rida_, wasthrown over the neck and shoulders,leaving the right shoulder and arm bare. A pair of simple sandals, the _na'l_, left the ankle-bonesbare. Over the _Izar_ waist-wrapper, a money belt was worn, and a bag, something like awoman's big handbag, with a long strap, was for carrying the passport and other valuable papers,such as the letter I had from Dr. Shawarbi. 
进入伊赫拉姆状态后，我们脱掉衣服，穿上两条白色毛巾。一条是_Izar_，折叠在腰间。另一条是_Rida_，披在脖子和肩膀上，露出右肩和手臂。一双简单的凉鞋，_na'l_，露出脚踝骨。在_Izar_的腰包上，系着一个钱带，还有一个类似女人大手提包的袋子，带着一条长带子，用来携带护照和其他有价值的文件，比如我从Shawarbi博士那里得到的信。
Every one of the thousands at the airport, about to leave for Jedda, was dressed this way. Youcould be a king or a peasant and no one would know. Some powerful personages, who werediscreetly pointed out to me, had on the same thing I had on. Once thus dressed, we all hadbegun intermittently calling out "_Labbayka! Labbayka_!" (Here I come, O Lord!) The airportsounded with the din of _Muhrim_ expressing their intention to perform the journey of the Hajj. 
机场上成千上万即将前往吉达的人，每个人都穿着这样的衣服。你可能是国王或农民，没有人会知道。有些人向我谨慎指出，一些有权势的人物和我穿着同样的衣服。一旦穿上这样的衣服，我们开始间歇性地呼喊“_Labbayka! Labbayka_!”（我来了，主啊！）机场响起了穆赫林表达他们打算进行哈吉之旅的喧嚣声。
Planeloads of pilgrims were taking off every few minutes, but the airport was jammed with more,and their friends and relatives waiting to see them off. Those not going were asking others to prayfor them at Mecca. We were on our plane, in the air, when I learned for the first time that with thecrush, there was not supposed to have been space for me, but strings had been pulled, andsomeone had been put off because they didn't want to disappoint an American Muslim. I feltmingled emotions of regret that I had inconvenienced and discomfited whoever was bumped offthe plane for me, and, with that, an utter humility and gratefulness that I had been paid such anhonor and respect. 
每隔几分钟就有满载朝圣者的飞机起飞，但机场仍然挤满了更多的人，他们的朋友和亲戚等着为他们送行。那些不去的人请求其他人在麦加为他们祈祷。当我们的飞机在空中飞行时，我第一次得知由于拥挤，本来没有我的位置，但是有人拉了关系，让一些人下了飞机，因为他们不想让我这个美国穆斯林失望。我感到复杂的情绪，既遗憾自己给被赶下飞机的人带来了不便和困扰，又感到完全的谦卑和感激，因为我得到了如此的荣誉和尊重。
Packed in the plane were white, black, brown, red, and yellow people, blue eyes and blond hair,and my kinky red hair-all together, brothers! All honoring the same God Allah, all in turn givingequal honor to each other. 
飞机上挤满了白人、黑人、棕色人种、红色人和黄色人种，蓝眼睛和金发，还有我那卷曲的红头发——都是兄弟！所有人都尊敬同一个上帝安拉，也轮流给予彼此同等的尊重。
From some in our group, the word was spreading from seat to seat that I was a Muslim fromAmerica. Faces turned, smiling toward me in greeting. A boxlunch was passed out and as we atethat, the word that a Muslim from America was aboard got up into the cockpit. 
从我们团队中的一些人开始，这个词从座位传到座位，说我是美国的穆斯林。人们转过头来，微笑着向我打招呼。午餐盒被递出来，当我们吃着的时候，一个穆斯林从美国登机的消息传到了驾驶舱里。
The captain of the plane came back to meet me. He was an Egyptian, his complexion was darkerthan mine; he could have walked in Harlem and no one would have given him a second glance.He was delighted to meet an American Muslim. When he invited me to visit the cockpit, I jumpedat the chance. 
飞机的机长回来见我。他是一个埃及人，他的肤色比我的还要黑；他可以走在哈莱姆区，没有人会多看他一眼。他很高兴见到一个美国穆斯林。当他邀请我去参观驾驶舱时，我抓住了这个机会。
The co-pilot was darker than he was. I can't tell you the feeling it gave me. I had never seen ablack man flying a jet. That instrument panel: no one ever could know what all of those dialsmeant! Both of the pilots were smiling at me, treating me with the same honor and respect I hadreceived ever since I left America. I stood there looking through the glass at the sky ahead of us.In America, I had ridden in more planes than probably any other Negro, and I never had beeninvited up into the cockpit. And there I was, with two Muslim seatmates, one from Egypt, the otherfrom Arabia, all of us bound for Mecca, with me up in the pilots' cabin. Brother, I _knew_ Allahwas with me. 
副驾驶比他还黑。我无法形容这给我的感觉。我从没见过黑人开喷气式飞机。那个仪表板：没有人能知道那些指针都意味着什么！两个飞行员都在微笑着看着我，对我给予了同样的尊重和敬意，自从我离开美国以来就一直如此。我站在那里透过玻璃看着我们前方的天空。在美国，我可能比其他任何黑人都坐过更多的飞机，但我从来没有被邀请到驾驶舱里。而我就在那里，和两个穆斯林座位同伴一起，一个来自埃及，另一个来自阿拉伯，我们都前往麦加，而我则在飞行员的机舱里。兄弟，我知道安拉与我同在。
I got back to my seat. All of the way, about an hour's flight, we pilgrims were loudly crying out,"_Labbayka! Labbayka_!" The plane landed at Jedda. It's a seaport town on the Red Sea, thearrival or disembarkation point for all pilgrims who come to Arabia to go to Mecca. Mecca is aboutforty miles to the east, inland. 
我回到我的座位上。整个飞行过程中，大约一个小时的飞行时间，我们朝圣者大声呼喊着“_Labbayka! Labbayka_!”飞机降落在吉达。这是一个位于红海的港口城镇，是所有前往阿拉伯麦加的朝圣者的到达或下船点。麦加位于内陆东部约40英里处。
The Jedda airport seemed even more crowded than Cairo's had been. Our party became anothershuffling unit in the shifting mass with every race on earth represented. Each party was making itsway toward the long line waiting to go through Customs. Before reaching Customs, each Hajjparty was assigned a _Mutawaf_, who would be responsible for transferring that party from Jeddato Mecca. Some pilgrims cried "_Labbayka_!" Others, sometimes large groups, were chanting inunison a prayer that I will translate, "I submit to no one butThee, O Allah, I submit to no one butThee. I submit to Thee because Thou hast no partner. All praise and blessings come from Thee,and Thou art alone in Thy kingdom." The essence of the prayer is the Oneness of God. 
吉达机场似乎比开罗机场更拥挤。我们的团体成为这个流动的人群中的另一个不断变换的部分，来自地球上每个种族的人都在其中。每个团体都在向长长的等待通关的队伍前进。在到达海关之前，每个哈吉团体都被分配了一个_Mutawaf_，负责将该团体从吉达到麦加转移。一些朝圣者高呼“_Labbayka_！”其他人，有时是大团体，齐声念诵着一段祈祷文，我将翻译它：“我只向你屈服，只有你，真主安拉，我只向你屈服。我向你屈服是因为你没有伴侣。所有的赞美和祝福都来自你，你在你的王国中是独一无二的。”这段祈祷文的精髓是上帝的唯一性。
Only officials were not wearing the _Ihram_ garb, or the white skull caps, long, white, nightshirt- looking gown and the little slippers of the _Mutawaf_, those who guided each pilgrim party, andtheir helpers. In Arabic, an _mmmm_ sound before a verb makes a verbal noun, so "_Mu_tawaf"meant "the one who guides" the pilgrims on the "_Tawaf_," which is the circumam-bulation of theKa'ba in Mecca. 
只有官员没有穿着_Ihram_服装，或者白色的圆顶帽子，长长的白色睡衣样的长袍和_Mutawaf_的小拖鞋，这些人指导每个朝圣团体，以及他们的助手。在阿拉伯语中，动词前的“_mmmm_”声音可以构成一个动词名词，因此“_Mu_tawaf”意味着“在_Tawaf_上引导”朝圣者，即环绕麦加的Ka'ba。
I was nervous, shuffling in the center of our group in the line waiting to have our passportsinspected. I had an apprehensive 
我很紧张，在我们队伍中间来回踱步，等待护照检查。我有一种不安的感觉
feeling. Look what I'm handing them. I'm in the Muslim world, right at The Fountain. I'm handingthem the American passport which signifies the exact opposite of what Islam stands for. 
感觉。看看我递给他们的东西。我在穆斯林世界，就在喷泉旁边。我递给他们的是美国护照，它象征着与伊斯兰教所代表的完全相反的东西。
The judge i n our group sensed my strain. He patted my shoulder. Love, humility, and truebrotherhood was almost a physical feeling wherever I turned. Then our group reached the clerkswho examined each passport and suitcase carefully and nodded to the pilgrim to move on. 
我们组的法官感觉到了我的紧张。他拍了拍我的肩膀。爱、谦卑和真正的兄弟情谊几乎是一种身体上的感觉，无论我转向哪里都能感受到。然后我们的团队到达了仔细检查每本护照和手提箱的办事员那里，并向朝圣者点头示意继续前进。
I was so nervous that when I turned the key in my bag, and it didn't work, I broke open the bag,fearing that they might think I had something in the bag that I shouldn't have. Then the clerk sawthat I was handing him an American passport. He held it, he looked at me and said something inArabic. My friends around me began speaking rapid Arabic, gesturing and pointing, trying tointercede for me. The judge asked me in English for my letter from Dr. Shawarbi, and he thrust itat the clerk, who read it. He gave the letter back, protesting-I could tell that. An argument wasgoing on, _about_ me. I felt like astupid fool, unable to say a word, I couldn't even understandwhat was being said. But, finally, sadly, the judge turned to me. 
我非常紧张，当我在包里找钥匙时，它没有起作用，我害怕他们认为我包里有不该有的东西，于是打开了包。然后办事员看到我递给他的是美国护照。他拿着它看着我说了些什么阿拉伯语。我身边的朋友开始快速地说阿拉伯语，做手势和指点，试图为我辩护。法官用英语问我是否带有Shawarbi博士的信，并将信塞给了办事员，他读了信。他把信还给我，我可以感觉到他在抗议。关于我的争论正在进行中。我感到自己像一个愚蠢的傻瓜，无法说一句话，甚至听不懂正在说什么。但最终，可悲的是，法官转向了我。
I had to go before the _Mahgama Sharia_, he explained. It was the Muslim high court whichexamined all possibly nonauthentic converts to the Islamic religion seeking to enter Mecca. It wasabsolute that no non-Muslim could enter Mecca. 
他解释说，我必须前往_Mahgama Sharia_。这是穆斯林高等法院，审查所有可能非真实的伊斯兰宗教皈依者试图进入麦加。毫无疑问，非穆斯林不能进入麦加。
My friends were going to have to go on to Mecca without me. They seemed stricken with concernfor me. And _I_ was stricken. I found the words to tell them, "Don't worry, I'll be fine. Allah guidesme." They said they would pray hourly in my behalf. The white-garbed _Mutawaf_ was urgingthem on, to keep schedule in the airport's human crush. With all of us waving, I watched them go. 
我的朋友将不得不继续前往麦加，没有我。他们似乎很担心我。而我也感到震惊。我找到了话来告诉他们：“别担心，我会好的。真主指引着我。”他们说他们会为我每小时祈祷一次。穿着白色衣服的_Mutawaf_正在催促他们，以保持机场人群的时间表。我们所有人都挥手告别，我看着他们离开。
It was then about three in the morning, a Friday morning. I never had been in such a jammedmass of people, but I never had felt more alone, and helpless, since I was a baby. Worse, Fridayin the Muslim world is a rough counterpart of Sunday in the Christian world. On Friday, all themembers of a Muslim community gather, to pray together. The event is called _yawn al- jum u'a_-"the day of gathering." It meant that no courts were held on Friday. I would have to waituntil Saturday, at least. 
那时大约是凌晨三点钟，一个星期五的早晨。我从来没有在如此拥挤的人群中间，但自从我小时候以来，我从未感到过更加孤独和无助。更糟糕的是，在穆斯林世界中，星期五相当于基督教世界中的星期日。在星期五，所有穆斯林社区的成员聚集在一起，一起祈祷。这个活动被称为“聚礼日”。这意味着法院不会在星期五开庭。我至少要等到星期六。
An official beckoned a young Arab _Mutawaf's_ aide. In broken English, the official explained thatI would be taken to a place right at the airport. My passport was kept at Customs. I wanted toobject, because it is a traveler's first law never to get separated from his passport, but I didn't. Inmy wrapped towels and sandals, I followed the aide in his skull cap, long white gown, andslippers. I guess we were quite a sight. People passing us were speaking all kinds of languages. Icouldn't speak anybody's language. I was in bad shape. 
一名官员示意一位年轻的阿拉伯_Mutawaf's_助手。用蹩脚的英语，这位官员解释说，我将被带到机场附近的一个地方。我的护照被扣留在海关。我想反对，因为旅行者的第一定律是永远不要与自己的护照分离，但我没有。在我的包裹毛巾和凉鞋中，我跟随着戴着圆顶帽子、穿着白色长袍和拖鞋的助手。我猜我们一定很引人注目。路过我们的人说着各种各样的语言。我不会说任何人的语言。我的情况很糟糕。
 Right outside the airport was a mosque, and above the airport was a huge, dormitory-likebuilding, four tiers high. It was semi-dark, not long before dawn, and planes were regularly takingoff and landing, their landing lights sweeping the runways, or their wing and tail lights blinking inthe sky. Pilgrims from Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia, to mention some, were moving toand from the dormitory where I was being taken. I don't believe that motion picture cameras everhave filmed a human spectacle more colorful than my eyes took in. We reached the dormitoryand began climbing, up to the fourth, top, tier, passing members of every race on earth. Chinese,Indonesians, Afghanistanians. Many, not yet changed into the _Ihram_ garb, still wore theirnational dress. It was like pages out of the _National Geographic_ magazine. 
机场外是一座清真寺，机场上方是一座巨大的宿舍式建筑，有四层楼高。天还没亮多久，半暗半明的，飞机定期起飞和降落，它们的着陆灯扫过跑道，或者它们的机翼和尾灯在天空中闪烁。来自加纳、印度尼西亚、日本和俄罗斯等国家的朝圣者进出着我被带到的宿舍。我不相信电影摄像机曾经拍摄过比我的眼睛所看到的更加丰富多彩的人类景象。我们到达了宿舍并开始爬升，一直爬到第四层，最高层，经过地球上每个种族的成员。中国人、印度尼西亚人、阿富汗人。许多人还没有换上_Ihram_服装，仍然穿着他们的民族服装。这就像《国家地理》杂志中的页面一样。
My guide, on the fourth tier, gestured me into a compartment that contained about fifteen people.Most lay curled up on their rugs asleep. I could tell that some were women, covered head andfoot. An old Russian Muslim and his wife were not asleep. They stared frankly at me. TwoEgyptian Muslims and a Persian roused and also stared as my guide moved us over into acomer. With gestures, he indicated that he would demonstrate to me the proper prayer ritualpostures. Imagine, being a Muslim minister, a leader in Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam, andnot knowing the prayer ritual. 
我的向导在第四层向我示意进入一个隔间，里面大约有十五个人。大多数人卷着毯子睡着了。我可以看出其中一些是女人，头和脚都盖住了。一位年老的俄罗斯穆斯林和他的太太没有睡着。他们坦率地盯着我看。当向导带我们走到一个小角落时，两个埃及穆斯林和一个波斯人也醒了过来，也盯着我看。他用手势表示，他将向我展示正确的祈祷仪式姿势。想象一下，作为一个穆斯林牧师，在以利亚·穆罕默德的伊斯兰国家中是一个领袖，却不知道祈祷仪式。
I tried to do what he did. I knew I wasn't doing it right. I could feel the other Muslims' eyes on me.Western ankles won't do what Muslim ankles have done for a lifetime. Asians squat when they sit,Westerners sit upright in chairs. When my guide was down in a posture, I tried everything I couldto get down as he was, but there I was, sticking up. After about an hour, my guide left, indicatingthat he would return later. 
我试着做他所做的。我知道我做错了。我能感觉到其他穆斯林的目光注视着我。西方人的脚踝不能像穆斯林的脚踝一样一辈子都在做着同样的事情。亚洲人坐下时是蹲着的，而西方人则是笔直地坐在椅子上。当我的向导采取一种姿势时，我尝试了一切方法来像他一样蹲下，但我却无法做到，一直直立着。大约一个小时后，我的向导离开了，表示他会稍后再回来。
I never even thought about sleeping. Watched by the Muslims, 
我从来没有想过睡觉。在穆斯林的注视下，
I kept practicing prayer posture. I refused to let myself think how ridiculous Imust have looked tothem. After a while, though, I learned a lime trick that would let me get down closer to the floor.But after two or three days, my ankle was going to swell. 
我不断地练习祈祷姿势。我拒绝让自己去想他们一定觉得我多么可笑。过了一会儿，我学会了一个时间技巧，可以让我更接近地面。但是两三天后，我的脚踝开始肿胀。
As the sleeping Muslims woke up, when dawn had broken, they almost instantly became awareof me, and we watched each other while they went about their business. I began to see what animportant role the rug played in the overall cultural life of the Muslims. Each individual had a smallprayer rug, and each man and wife, or large group, had a larger communal rug. These Muslimsprayed on their rugs there in the compartment. Then they spread a tablecloth over the rug andate, so the rug became the dining room. Removing the dishes and cloth, they sat on the rug-aliving room. Then they curl up and sleep on the rug-a bedroom. In that compartment, before I wasto leave it, it dawned on me for the first time why the fence had paid such a high price for Orientalrugs when I had been a burglar in Boston. It was because so much intricate care was taken toweave fine rugs in countries where rugs were so culturally versatile. Later, in Mecca, I would seeyet another use of the rug. When any kind of dispute arose, someone who was respected highlyand who was not involved would sit on a rug with the disputers around him, which made the rug acourtroom. In other instances it was a classroom. 
当睡着的穆斯林们醒来时，天已经亮了，他们几乎立刻意识到了我，我们在他们忙着自己的事情时互相注视着。我开始明白地毯在穆斯林整体文化生活中扮演着多么重要的角色。每个人都有一块小祈祷地毯，每个男人和妻子或大团体都有一块更大的公共地毯。这些穆斯林在他们所在的隔间里往他们的地毯上喷水。然后他们在地毯上铺上桌布吃饭，所以地毯就成了餐厅。把盘子和布拿走后，他们就坐在地毯上——客厅。然后他们蜷缩起来睡在地毯上——卧室。在那个隔间里，在我离开之前，我第一次明白了为什么当我还是波士顿的一名窃贼时，围墙花了如此高的价格购买东方地毯。因为在那些地毯在文化上如此多才多艺的国家里，人们花费了很多心思来编织精美的地毯。后来，在麦加，我看到了地毯的另一种用途。当任何类型的争端出现时，一个受人尊敬且不涉及其中的人会坐在一块地毯上，与争端者围在他周围，这使得地毯成为了法庭。在其他情况下，它是一个教室。
One of the Egyptian Muslims, particularly, kept watching me out of the corner of his eye. I smiledat him. He got up and came over to me. "Hel-lo-" he said. It sounded like the Gettysburg Address.I beamed at him, "Hello!" I asked his name. "Name? Name?" He was trying hard, but he didn't getit. We tried some words on each other. I'd guess his English vocabulary spanned maybe twentywords. Just enough to frustrate me. I was trying to get him to comprehend anything. "Sky." I'dpoint. He'd smile. "Sky," I'd say again, gesturing for him to repeat it after me. He would. "Airplane .. . rug . . . foot. . . sandal . . . eyes. . . ." Like that. Then an amazing thing happened. I was so gladI had some communication with a human being, I was just saying whatever came to mind. Isaid"Muhammad Ali Clay-" All of the Muslims listening lighted up like a Christmas tree. "You?You?" My friend was pointing at me . I shook my head, "No, no. Muhammad Ali Clay my friend- _friend_!" They half understood me. Some of them didn't understand, and that's how it began toget around that I was Cassius Clay, world heavyweight champion. I was later to learn thatapparently every man, woman and child in the Muslim world had heard how Sonny Liston (who inthe Muslim world had the image of a man-eating ogre) had been beaten in Goliath-David fashionby Cassius Clay, who then had told the world that his name was Muhammad Ali and his religionwas Islam and Allah had given him his victory. 
其中一个埃及穆斯林特别地用眼角余光看着我。我朝他微笑。他起身走到我身边。“Hel-lo-”他说。听起来像葛底斯堡演说。我对他灿烂地笑着，“Hello!”我问了他的名字。“Name? Name?”他努力着，但他不明白。我们试着用一些单词交流。我猜他的英语词汇量大约只有二十个单词。这足以让我沮丧了。我试图让他理解任何事情。“Sky.”我会指出来。他会微笑。“Sky,”我会再次说，示意他跟着我重复它。他会的。“Airplane .. . rug . . . foot. . . sandal . . . eyes. . . .”像这样。然后一件令人惊奇的事情发生了。我很高兴能和一个人交流，我只是说出脑海中想到的任何话。我说“Muhammad Ali Clay-”所有的穆斯林都像圣诞树一样亮起来。“你？你？”我的朋友指着我。我摇摇头，“不，不。Muhammad Ali Clay我的朋友-_朋友_！”他们半懂不懂。有些人不理解，这就是我开始被称为卡修斯·克莱的世界重量级冠军的方式。后来我得知，显然穆斯林世界中的每个男人、女人和孩子都听说过桑尼·利斯顿（在穆斯林世界中被视为吃人的妖怪）如何被卡修斯·克莱以大卫击败歌利亚的方式打败，然后他告诉世界他的名字是穆罕默德·阿里，他的宗教是伊斯兰教，安拉给了他胜利。
Establishing the rapport was the best thing that could have happened in the compartment. Mybeing an American Muslim changed the attitudes from merely watching me to wanting to look outfor me. Now, the others began smiling steadily. They came closer, they were frankly looking meup and down. Inspecting me. Very friendly. I was like a man from Mars. 
建立这种友好关系是隔间里发生的最好的事情。我作为一个美国穆斯林改变了他们的态度，从仅仅观察我到想要照顾我。现在，其他人开始稳定地微笑。他们走近了，坦率地上下打量着我。检查我。非常友好。我就像一个来自火星的人。
The _Mutawaf_'s aide returned, indicating that I should go with him. He pointed from our tierdown at the mosque and I knew that he had come to take me to make the morning prayer, ElSobh, always before sunrise. I followed him down, and we passed pilgrims by the thousands,babbling languages, everything but English. I was angry with myself for not having taken the timeto learn more of the orthodox prayer rituals before leaving America. In Elijah Muhammad's Nationof Islam, we hadn't prayed in Arabic. About a dozen or more years before, when I was in prison, amember of the orthodox Muslim movement in Boston, named Abdul Hameed, had visited me andhad later sent me prayers in Arabic. At that time, I had learned those prayers phonetically. But Ihadn't used them since. 
_Mutawaf_的助手回来了，示意我跟着他走。他从我们的台阶上指着清真寺，我知道他是来带我去做晨祷的，ElSobh，总是在日出之前。我跟着他走，我们经过了成千上万的朝圣者，说着各种各样的语言，除了英语。我对自己很生气，因为我没有花时间在美国离开之前学习更多的正统祈祷仪式。在以利亚·穆罕默德的伊斯兰国家中，我们不使用阿拉伯语祈祷。大约十多年前，当我在监狱里时，波士顿的一位正统穆斯林运动成员Abdul Hameed曾拜访过我，并在后来给我送来了阿拉伯语的祷告。那时，我已经学会了这些祷告的发音。但从那以后我就再也没有用过它们了。
I made up my mind to let the guide do everything first and I would watch him. It wasn't hard to gethim to do things first. He wanted to anyway. Just outsidethe mosque there was a long trough withrows of faucets. Ablutions had to precede praying. I knew that. Even watching the _Mutawaf_'shelper, I didn't get it right. There's an exact way that an orthodox Muslim washes, and the exactway is very important. 
我决定让导游先做所有的事情，我会观察他。让他先做事并不难。无论如何他都想做。就在清真寺外面有一条长长的水槽，一排水龙头。在祈祷之前必须进行净化仪式。我知道这一点。即使看着_Mutawaf_的助手，我也做不对。正统穆斯林有一套精确的洗手方式，而这种精确的方式非常重要。
I followed him into the mosque, just a step behind, watching. He did his prostration, his head tothe ground. I did mine. "_Bi-smi-llahi-r- Rahmain-r-Rahim-_" ("In the name of Allah, the Beneficent,the Merciful-") All Muslim prayers began that way. After that, I may not have been mumbling theright thing, but I was mumbling. 
我跟着他走进清真寺，一步之遥，观察着。他做了鞠躬礼，头贴在地上。我也这样做了。“_Bi-smi-llahi-r- Rahmain-r-Rahim-_”（“奉真主之名，仁慈的，宽容的”）所有穆斯林的祷告都是这样开始的。在那之后，我可能没有喃喃自语正确的话，但我一直在咕哝着。
I don't mean to have any of this sound joking. It was far from a joke with me. No one whohappened to be watching could tell that I wasn't saying what the others said. 
我并不是想用这些话来开玩笑。这对我来说绝不是玩笑。任何碰巧看到的人都不会知道我没有说其他人说的话。
*     *     * 
After that Sunrise Prayer, my guide accompanied me back up to the fourth tier. By sign language,he said he would return within three hours, then he left. 
日出祈祷之后，我的导游陪我回到第四层。通过手势语言，他说他会在三小时内回来，然后他就离开了。
Our tier gave an excellent daylight view of the whole airport area. I stood at the railing, watching.Planes were landing and taking off like clockwork. Thousands upon thousands of people from allover the world made colorful patterns of movement. I saw groups leaving for Mecca, in buses,trucks, cars. I saw some setting out to walk the forty miles. I wished that I could start walking. Atleast, I knew how to do that. 
我们的台阶提供了一个绝佳的日光景观，可以看到整个机场区域。我站在栏杆上，看着飞机像钟表一样降落和起飞。成千上万来自世界各地的人们形成了丰富多彩的运动图案。我看到一群人乘坐巴士、卡车、汽车离开麦加。我看到一些人开始步行四十英里。我希望我也能开始走路。至少，我知道该怎么做。
I was afraid to think what might lie ahead. Would I be rejected as a Mecca pilgrim? I wonderedwhat the test would consist of, and when I would face the Muslim high court. 
我害怕去想未来会发生什么。我会被拒绝作为麦加朝圣者吗？我想知道测试会包括什么，以及何时面对穆斯林高等法院。
 The Persian Muslim in our compartment came up to me at the rail. He greeted me, hesitantly,"Amer . . . American?" He indicated that he wanted me to come and have breakfast with him andhis wife, on their rug. I knew that it was an immense offer he was making. You don't have tea witha Muslim's wife.  I didn't want to impose, I don't know if the Persian understood or not when Ishook my head and smiled, meaning "No, thanks." He brought me some tea and cookies,anyway. Until then, I hadn't even thought about eating. 
我们隔间的波斯穆斯林走到我旁边的栏杆上。他犹豫地问候我，“Amer... American？”（美国人）他示意他想让我和他妻子一起到他们的地毯上去吃早餐。我知道这是一个巨大的邀请。你不应该和穆斯林的妻子喝茶。我不想强求，我不知道波斯人是否理解我摇头微笑的意思，意思是“不，谢谢。”不管怎样，他还是给我带来了一些茶和饼干。直到那时，我甚至都没想过要吃东西。
Others made gestures. They would just come up and smile and nod at me. My first friend, the onewho had spoken a little English, was gone. I didn't know it, but he was spreading the word of anAmerican Muslim on the fourth tier. Traffic had begun to pick up, going past our compartment.Muslims in the _Ihram_ garb, or still in their national dress, walked slowly past, smiling. It wouldgo on for as long as I was there to be seen. But I hadn't yet learned that I was the attraction. 
其他人也做了手势。他们只是走过来，微笑着向我点头。我的第一个朋友，那个会说一点英语的人已经离开了。我不知道，但他正在第四层传播一个美国穆斯林的消息。交通开始变得繁忙起来，经过我们的隔间。穿着_Ihram_服装或仍然穿着本国服装的穆斯林缓慢地走过，微笑着。只要我还在那里被看到，这种情况就会持续下去。但我还不知道我是吸引点。
I have always been restless, and curious. The _Mutawaf_'s aide didn't return in the three hourshe had said, and that made me nervous.  I feared that he had given up on me as beyond help. Bythen, too, I was really getting hungry. All of the Muslims in the compartment had offered me food,and I had refused. The trouble was, I have to admit it, at that point I didn't know if I could go 
我一直都很不安，很好奇。_Mutawaf_的助手没有在他说的三小时内回来，这让我感到很紧张。我担心他已经放弃了我，认为我无法帮助。到那时，我也真的开始饿了。隔间里所有的穆斯林都给我提供了食物，但我拒绝了。问题是，我必须承认，在这一点上我不知道我是否能够去
for their manner of eating. Everything was in one pot on the dining-room rug, and I saw them justfall right in, using their hands. 
他们的饮食习惯。一切都在餐厅地毯上的一个大锅里，我看到他们直接用手吃。
I kept standing at the tier railing observing the courtyard below, and I decided to explore a bit onmy own. I went down to the first tier. I thought, then, that maybe I shouldn't get too far, someonemight come for me. So I went back up to our compartment. In about forty-five minutes, I wentback down. I went farther this time, feeling my way. I saw a little restaurant in the courtyard. I wentstraight in there. It was jam med, and babbling with languages. Using gestures, Ibought a wholeroasted chicken and something like thick potato chips. I got back out in the courtyard and I toreup that chicken, using my hands. Muslims were doing the same thing all around me. I saw men atleast seventy years old bringing both legs up under them, until they made a human knot ofthemselves, eating with as much aplomb and satisfaction as though they had been in a finerestaurant with waiters all over the place. All ate as One, and slept as One. Everything about thepilgrimage atmosphere accented the Oneness of Man under One God. 
我一直站在台阶的栏杆上观察下面的院子，我决定自己去探索一下。我走到第一层。我想，也许我不应该走得太远，有人会来找我。所以我回到我们的隔间。大约45分钟后，我又走了下去。这次我走得更远了，摸索着前进。我看到院子里有一家小餐馆。我直接走了进去。里面很拥挤，充满了各种语言的声音。我用手势买了一整只烤鸡和一些像厚薯片的东西。我回到院子里，用手撕开了那只鸡。穆斯林们就在我身边做着同样的事情。我看到至少有七十岁的老人把两条腿都盘起来，直到他们把自己变成了一个人形结，吃的时候表现得泰然自若、心满意足，仿佛他们身处一个精致的餐厅里，周围都是服务员。所有人都一起吃饭，一起睡觉。朝圣氛围中的一切都强调了在真主之下人类的一体性。
I made, during the day, several trips up to the compartment and back out in the courtyard, eachtime exploring a little further than before. Once, I nodded at two black men standing together. Inearly shouted when one spoke to me in British-accented English. Before their party approached,ready to leave for Mecca, we were able to talk enough to exchange that I was American and theywere Ethiopians. I was heartsick. I had found two English-speaking Muslims at last-and they wereleaving. The Ethiopians had both been schooled in Cairo, and they were living in Ryadh, thepolitical capital of Arabia. I was later going to learn to my surprise that in Ethiopia, with eighteenmillion people, ten million are Muslims. Most people think Ethiopia is Christian. But only itsgovernment is Christian. The West has always helped to keep the Christian government in power. 
白天，我多次往返于隔间和院子之间，每次都比之前走得更远一点。有一次，我向两个站在一起的黑人点了点头。当其中一个用带有英国口音的英语和我说话时，我差点叫了出来。在他们一行人准备离开前往麦加之前，我们得以交谈并交换了一些信息，我知道我是美国人，而他们是埃塞俄比亚人。我感到心如刀绞。最终我找到了两个会说英语的穆斯林——但他们要离开了。这两个埃塞俄比亚人都曾在开罗接受过教育，他们住在阿拉伯的政治首都利雅得。后来我惊讶地发现，在拥有1800万人口的埃塞俄比亚，有1000万人是穆斯林。大多数人认为埃塞俄比亚是基督教国家。但只有政府是基督教国家。西方一直帮助维持着这个基督教政府的掌权地位。
I had just said my Sunset Prayer, _El Maghrib_; I was lying on my cot in the fourth-tiercompartment, feeling blue and alone, when out of the darkness came a sudden light! 
我刚做完我的日落祈祷， _ El Maghrib _ ;我躺在第四层隔间的小床上，感到孤独和沮丧，这时黑暗中突然亮起了一盏灯！
It was actually a sudden thought. On one of my venturings in the yard full of activity below, I hadnoticed four men, officials, seated at a table with a telephone. Now, I thought about seeing themthere, and with _telephone_, my mind flashed to the connection that Dr. Shawarbi in New Yorkhad given me, the telephone number of the son of the author of the book which had beenboughta whole roasted chicken and something like thick potato chips. I got back out in the courtyard andI tore up that chicken, using my hands. Muslims were doing the same thing all around me. I sawmen at least seventy years old bringing both legs up under them, until they made a human knot ofthemselves, eating with as much aplomb and satisfaction as though they had been in a finerestaurant with waiters all over the place. All ate as One, and slept as One. Everything about thepilgrimage atmosphere accented the Oneness of Man under One God. 
这实际上是一个突然的想法。在我一次冒险到下面充满活动的院子里时，我注意到四个男人，官员们，坐在一张桌子旁，桌子上有一部电话。现在，我想到了看到他们在那里，并且有了电话，我的思绪闪过了纽约的Shawarbi博士给我的联系，那本书的作者的儿子的电话号码，这本书已经买了一整只烤鸡和一些像厚薯片的东西。我又回到院子里，用手撕开了那只鸡。穆斯林们就在我身边做着同样的事情。我看到至少有七十岁的老人把两条腿都盘起来，直到他们把自己变成了一个人形结，吃的时候表现得泰然自若、心满意足，仿佛他们身处一个精致的餐厅里，周围都是服务员。所有人都一起吃饭，一起睡觉。朝圣氛围中的一切都强调了在真主之下人类的一体性。

I had just said my Sunset Prayer, _El Maghrib_; I was lying on my cot in the fourth-tiercompartment, feeling blue and alone, when out of the darkness came a sudden light! 
我刚做完我的日落祈祷， _ El Maghrib _ ;我躺在第四层隔间的小床上，感到孤独和沮丧，这时黑暗中突然亮起了一盏灯！
It was actually a sudden thought. On one of my venturings in the yard full of activity below, I hadnoticed four men, officials, seated at a table with a telephone. Now, I thought about seeing themthere, and with _telephone_, my mind flashed to the connection that Dr. Shawarbi in New Yorkhad given me, the telephone number of the son of the author of the book which had beendone."My father will be so happy to meet you," said Dr. Azzam. The author who had sent me the book! 
这实际上是一个突然的想法。在我一次冒险到下面充满活动的院子里时，我注意到四个男人，官员们，坐在一张桌子旁，桌子上有一部电话。现在，我想到了看到他们在那里，并且有了电话，我的思绪闪过了纽约的Shawarbi博士给我的联系，那本书的作者的儿子的电话号码，这本书已经做完了。"我父亲会很高兴见到你，" Azzam博士说道。那位给我寄来书的作者！
I asked questions about his father. Abd-Al-Rahman Azzam was known as Azzam Pasha, or LordAzzam, until the Egyptian revolution, when President Nasser eliminated all "Lord" and "Noble"titles. "He should be at my home when we get there," Dr. Azzam said. "He spends much time inNew York with his United Nations work, and he has followed you with great interest." 
我问起了他父亲的事情。阿卜杜勒-拉赫曼·阿扎姆被称为阿扎姆帕夏，或阿扎姆勋爵，直到埃及革命时纳赛尔总统取消了所有“勋爵”和“贵族”的称号。“当我们到达那里时，他应该在我的家里，”阿扎姆博士说。“他在纽约联合国工作的时间很长，他一直非常关注你。”
I was speechless. 
我无言以对。
It was early in the morning when we reached Dr. Azzam's home. His father was there, his father'sbrother, a chemist, and another friend-all up that early, waiting. Each of them embraced me asthough I were a long-lost child. I had never seen these men before in my life, and they treated meso good! I am going to tell you that I had never been so honored in my life, nor had I everreceived such true hospitality. 
我们到达阿扎姆博士家时是清晨。他的父亲在那里，他父亲的兄弟，一位化学家，还有另一个朋友——都早早地起床等着。他们每个人都拥抱着我，好像我是一个失散多年的孩子。我一生中从未见过这些人，他们对我太好了！我要告诉你，我一生中从未受到过如此的荣誉，也从未受到过如此真诚的款待。
A servant brought tea and coffee, and disappeared. I was urged to make myself comfortable. Nowomen were anywhere in view. In Arabia, you could easily think there were no females. 
一个仆人端来了茶和咖啡，然后消失了。我被催促让自己感到舒适。现在到处都看不到女人。在阿拉伯，你很容易认为没有女性。
Dr. Abd-Al-Rahman Azzam dominated the conversation. Why hadn't I called before? Theycouldn't understand why I hadn't. Was I comfortable? They seemed embarrassed that I had spentthe time at the airport; that I had been delayed in getting to Mecca. No matter how I protested thatI felt no inconvenience, that I was fine, they would not hear it. "You must rest," Dr. Azzam said. Hewent to use the telephone. 
阿卜杜勒-拉赫曼·阿扎姆博士主导了谈话。为什么我之前没有打电话？他们无法理解我为什么没有。我是否感到舒适？他们似乎对我在机场度过的时间感到尴尬，我在前往麦加的路上被耽搁了。无论我怎么抗议说我没有感到任何不便，我都没事，他们都不听。“你必须休息，”阿扎姆博士说道。他走过去使用电话。
I didn't know what this distinguished man was doing. I had no dream. When I was told that I wouldbe brought back for dinner that evening, and that, meanwhile, I should get back in the car, howcould I have realized that I was about to see the epitome of Muslim hospitality? 
我不知道这位尊贵的人在做什么。我没有梦想。当我被告知我将在那天晚上被带回来吃晚饭时，同时我应该回到车里，我怎么会意识到我即将看到穆斯林好客的缩影呢？
Abd-Al-Rahman Azzam, when at home, lived in a suite at the Jedda Palace Hotel. Because I hadcome to them with a letter from a friend, he was going to stay at his son's home, and let me usehis suite, until I could get on to Mecca. 
阿卜杜勒-拉赫曼·阿扎姆在家中时住在吉达宫酒店的一间套房里。因为我带着朋友的一封信来找他们，所以他打算留在他儿子的家里，让我使用他的套房，直到我能够前往麦加。
When I found out, there was no use protesting: I was in the suite; young Dr. Azzam was gone;there was no one to protest to. The three-room suite had a bathroom that was as big as a doubleat the New York Hilton. It was suite number 214. There was even a porch outside, affording abeautiful view of the ancient Red Sea city. 
当我意识到这一点时，抗议已经没有用了：我住在套房里；年轻的阿扎姆博士已经离开了；没有人可以抗议。这个三居室的套房有一个浴室，和纽约希尔顿酒店的双人间一样大。这是214号套房。外面甚至还有一个门廊，可以欣赏到这座古老的红海城市的美丽景色。
There had never before been in my emotions such an impulse to pray-and I did, prostratingmyself on the living-room rug. 
我的情感中从未有过这样的祈祷冲动——我这样做了，在起居室里的地毯上跪下来。
Nothing in either of my two careers as a black man in America had served to give me anyidealistic tendencies. My instincts automatically examined the reasons, the motives, of anyonewho did anything they didn't have to do for me. Always in my life, if it was any white person, Icould see a selfish motive. 
我在美国当黑人的两次职业生涯中，没有任何东西能让我产生任何理想主义倾向。我的本能自动地检查任何人做任何他们不必为我做的事情的原因和动机。在我的生活中，如果有任何白人，我总是能看到一个自私的动机。
But there in that hotel that morning, a telephone call and a few hours away from the cot on thefourth-floor tier of the dormitory, was one of the few times I had been so awed that I was totallywithout resistance. That white man-at least he would have been considered "white" in America- related to Arabia's ruler, to whom he was a close advisor, truly an international man, with nothingin the world to gain, had given up his suite to me, for my transient comfort. He had _nothing_ togain. He didn't need me. He had everything. In fact, he had more to lose than gain. He hadfollowed the American press about me. If he did that, he knew there was only stigma attached tome. I was supposed to have horns. I was a "racist." I was "anti-white"-and he from allappearances was white. I wassupposed to be a criminal; not only that, but everyone was evenaccusing me of using his religion of Islam as a cloak for my criminal practices and philosophies.Even if he had had some motive to use me, he knew that I was separated from Elijah Muhammadand the Nation of Islam, my "power base," according to the press in America. The onlyorganization that I had was just a few weeks old. I had no job. I had no money. Just to get overthere, I had had to borrow money from my sister. 
但那天早上在那家旅馆里，一个电话和离宿舍四楼的床几个小时的距离，是我为数不多的几次感到敬畏的时刻之一，我完全没有抵抗。那个白人——至少他在美国会被认为“白人”——与阿拉伯的统治者有联系，他是她的亲密顾问，一个真正的国际人物，在这个世界上没有什么可得到的，却把他的套房让给了我，为了我的短暂舒适。他没有任何可得到的。他不需要我。他已经拥有了一切。事实上，他失去的比得到的更多。他一直关注着美国媒体对我报道。如果他这样做了，他知道我只是被贴上了污名。我应该长着角。我是一个“种族主义者”。“反白人”——而他外表上是白人。我应该是一个罪犯；不仅如此，每个人都甚至指责我用他的宗教伊斯兰教作为我的犯罪行为和哲学的掩护。即使他有利用我的动机，他知道我已经与美国媒体所说的“权力基础”分离了，即我和伊利贾·穆罕默德以及伊斯兰国家组织。我唯一的组织只是成立了几个星期。我没有工作。我没有钱。只是为了到达那里，我不得不向我姐姐借钱。
That morning was when I first began to reappraise the "white man." It was when I first began toperceive that "white man," as commonly used, means complexion only secondarily; primarily itdescribed attitudes and actions. In America, "white man" meant specific attitudes and actionstoward the black man, and toward all other non-white men. But in the Muslim world, I had seenthat men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been. 
那天早上是我第一次开始重新评价“白人”。那是我第一次开始意识到，通常所说的“白人”只是肤色的次要描述；它主要描述了态度和行为。在美国，“白人”意味着对黑人和其他所有非白人男性的特定态度和行为。但在穆斯林世界，我看到了拥有白皙肤色的人比任何人都更真诚地表现出兄弟情谊。
That morning was the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about "white" men. 
那天早上是我开始彻底改变对“白人”的看法的起点。
I should quote from my notebook here. I wrote this about noon, in the hotel: "My excitement,sitting here, waiting to go before the Hajj Committee, is indescribable. My window faces to thesea westward. The streets are filled with the incoming pilgrims from all over the world. Theprayers are to Allah and verses from the Quran are on the lips of everyone. Never have I seensuch a beautiful sight, nor witnessed such a scene, nor felt such an atmosphere. Although I amexcited, I feel safe and secure, thousands of miles from the totally different life that I have known.Imagine that twenty-four hours ago, I was in the fourth-floor room over the airport, surrounded bypeople with whom I could not communicate, feeling uncertain about the future, and very lonely,and then _one_ phone call, following Dr. Shawarbi's instructions. I have met one of the mostpowerful men in the Muslim world. I will soon sleep in his bed at theJedda Palace. I know that Iam surrounded by friends whose sincerity and religious zeal I can feel. I must pray again to thankAllah for this blessing, and I must pray again that my wife and children back in America willalways be blessed for their sacrifices, too." 
我应该在这里引用我的笔记本。这是我在中午的时候在旅馆里写的：“我坐在这里，等待前往哈吉委员会面前，兴奋之情难以言表。我的窗户面向西面的大海。街道上挤满了来自世界各地的朝圣者。大家都在向真主祈祷，口中念着古兰经的诗句。我从未见过如此美丽的景象，也从未目睹过这样的场景，更没有感受过这样的氛围。尽管我很兴奋，但我感到非常安全和安心，距离我所知的完全不同生活的数千英里之外。想象一下，二十四小时前，我还在机场上方四楼的房间里，周围都是与我无法交流的人，对未来感到不确定，非常孤独，然后按照Shawarbi博士的指示打了一个电话。我已经遇到了穆斯林世界中最有权势的人之一。我很快就会在他的床上睡觉了。我知道我身边都是真诚的朋友，我可以感受到他们的宗教热情。我必须再次祈祷感谢真主给予我这个祝福，我也必须再次祈祷我的妻子和孩子在美国永远受到祝福，因为他们也做出了牺牲。”
I did pray, two more prayers, as I had told my notebook. Then I slept for about four hours, until thetelephone rang. It was young Dr. Azzam. In another hour, he would pick me up to return me therefor dinner. I tumbled words over one another, trying to express some of the thanks I felt for all oftheir actions. He cut me off. "Ma sha'a-llah"-which means, "It is as Allah has pleased." 
我按照笔记本上所写的那样做了两次祈祷。然后我睡了大约四个小时，直到电话响了。是年轻的阿扎姆博士打来的。再过一个小时，他就会来接我回去吃晚饭。我语无伦次地试图表达一些感激之情，感谢他们所做的一切。他打断了我的话：“Ma sha'a-llah”，意思是“真主的意愿如此”。
I seized the opportunity to run down into the lobby, to see it again before Dr. Azzam arrived.When I opened my door, just across the hall from me a man in some ceremonial dress, whoobviously lived there, was also headed downstairs, surrounded by attendants. I followed themdown, then through the lobby. Outside, a small caravan of automobiles was wailing. My neighborappeared through the Jedda Palace Hotel's front entrance and people rushed and crowded him,kissing his hand. I found out who he was: the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Later, in the hotel, Iwould have the opportunity to talk with him for about a half-hour. He was a cordial man of greatdignity. He was well up on world affairs, and even the latest events in America. 
我抓住机会跑到大厅，想在阿扎姆博士到达之前再看一眼。当我打开房门时，我看到对面的大厅里有一个穿着仪式服装的男人，显然是住在这里的，周围围着随从正往楼下走。我跟在他们后面穿过大厅。外面，一队小汽车正在哀号。我的邻居从Jedda Palace酒店的前门出现，人们冲过去拥挤着他，亲吻他的手。我发现他是谁：耶路撒冷的大穆夫提。后来，在酒店里，我有机会和他交谈了大约半个小时。他是一个和蔼可亲、非常尊贵的人。他对世界事务了如指掌，甚至对美国最新的事件也很了解。
I will never forget the dinner at the Azzam home. I quote my notebook again: "I couldn't say in mymind that these were 'white' men. W hy, the men acted as if they were brothers of mine, the elderDr. Azzam as if he were my father. His fatherly, scholarly speech. I _felt_ like he was my father.He was, you could tell, a highly skilled diplomat, with a broad range of mind. His knowledge wasso worldly. He was as current on world affairs as some people are to what's going on in theirliving room. 
我永远不会忘记在阿扎姆家吃的晚餐。我再引用一下我的笔记本：“我无法在我的脑海中说这些人是‘白人’。为什么，这些男人表现得好像他们是我兄弟一样，年长的阿扎姆博士表现得好像他是我父亲一样。他慈父般的、学者般的言论。我感觉他就像我父亲一样。你可以看得出来，他是一个高超的外交官，思维开阔。他的知识如此广泛。他对世界事务的了解程度和有些人对他们客厅里发生的事情的了解程度一样。”
"The more we talked, the more his vast reservoir of knowledge and its varietyseemed unlimited.He spoke of the racial lineage of the descendants of Muhammad the Prophet, and he showedhow they were both black and white. He also pointed out how color, the complexities of color, andthe problems of color which exist in the Muslim world, exist only where, and to the extent that,that area of the Muslim world has been influenced by the West. He said that if one encounteredany differences based on attitude toward color, this directly reflected the degree of Westerninfluence." 
我们谈得越多，他广博的知识储备和它的多样性似乎就无限无尽。他谈到先知穆罕默德的后代的种族血统，并展示了他们既有黑人也有白人。他还指出，穆斯林世界中存在的肤色、肤色的复杂性和肤色问题只存在于受西方影响的地区和程度上。他说，如果遇到任何基于对颜色的态度不同的情况，这直接反映了西方影响的程度。
I learned during dinner that while I was at the hotel, the Hajj Committee Court had been notifiedabout my case, and that in the morning I should be there. And I was. 
在晚餐期间，我得知当我在旅馆时，哈吉委员会法院已经通知了我的案件，并且在早上我应该在那里。
The judge was Sheikh Muhammad Harkon. The Court was empty except for me and a sister fromIndia, formerly a Protestant, who had converted to Islam, and was, like me, trying to make theHajj. She was brown-skinned, with a small face that was mostly covered. Judge Harkon was akind, impressive man. We talked. He asked me some questions, having to do with my sincerity. Ianswered him as truly as I could. He not only recognized me as a true Muslim, but he gave metwo books, one in English, the other in Arabic. He recorded my name in the Holy Register of trueMuslims, and we were ready to part. He told me, "I hope you will become a great preacher ofIslam in America." I said that I shared that hope, and I would try to fulfill it. 
法官是谢赫·穆罕默德·哈康。法庭上除了我和一位来自印度的修女外，空无一人。她曾经是一名新教徒，后来皈依了伊斯兰教，和我一样试图完成朝觐之旅。她皮肤棕色，小脸大部分被遮盖住了。哈康法官是一位和蔼可亲、令人印象深刻的人。我们交谈起来。他问了我一些问题，与我是否真诚有关。我尽可能真实地回答了他。他不仅承认我是一个真正的穆斯林，还给了我两本书，一本英语的，另一本阿拉伯语的。他在真穆斯林的神圣登记册上记录下了我的名字，然后我们准备分别了。他告诉我：“我希望你成为美国伟大的伊斯兰教传教士。”我说我也希望如此，并且我会努力实现它。
The Azzam family were very elated that I was qualified and accepted to go to Mecca. I had lunchat the Jedda Palace. Then I slept again for several hours, until the telephone awakened me. 
阿扎姆一家对我有资格并被接受前往麦加感到非常欣喜。我在Jedda Palace吃了午餐。然后我再次睡了几个小时，直到电话把我吵醒。
It was Muhammad Abdul Azziz Maged, the Deputy Chief of Protocol for Prince Faisal. "A specialcar will be waiting to take you to Mecca, right after your dinner," he told me. He advised me to eatheartily, as the Hajj rituals require plenty of strength.I was beyond astonishment by then. 
来电话的是费萨尔亲王的礼宾部副部长Muhammad Abdul Azziz Maged。“一辆专车将在晚餐后接您前往麦加，”他告诉我。他建议我大吃一顿，因为朝觐仪式需要大量的体力。那时我已经惊讶得不知所措了。
Two young Arabs accompanied me to Mecca. A well-lighted, modem turnpike highway made thetrip easy. Guards at intervals along the way took one look at the car, and the driver made a sign,and we were passed through, never even having to slow down. I was, all at once, thrilled,important, humble, and thankful. 
两个年轻的阿拉伯人陪我前往麦加。一条照明良好、现代化的收费公路使旅途变得轻松。沿途每隔一段路就有守卫，他们看了一眼车子，司机做了个手势，我们就通过了，甚至不必减速。我一下子感到兴奋、重要、谦卑和感激。
Mecca, when we entered, seemed as ancient as time itself. Our car slowed through the windingstreets, lined by shops on both sides and with buses, cars, and trucks, and tens of thousands ofpilgrims from all over the earth were everywhere. 
当我们进入麦加时，它看起来就像时间本身一样古老。我们的车子在蜿蜒的街道上缓慢行驶，两旁是商店和公共汽车、汽车和卡车，来自世界各地的成千上万的朝圣者无处不在。
The car halted briefly at a place where a _Mutawaf_ was waiting for me. He wore the whiteskullcap and long nightshirt garb that I had seen at the airport. He was a short, dark-skinnedArab, named Muhammad. He spoke no English whatever. 
车子在一个_ Mutawaf _等着我的地方短暂停留。他戴着我在机场看到的白色无边帽和长睡衣。他是一个矮小的、黑皮肤的阿拉伯人，名叫穆罕默德。他根本不会说英语。
We parked near the Great Mosque. We performed our ablutions and entered. Pilgrims seemed tobe on top of each other, there were so many, lying, sitting, sleeping, praying, walking. 
我们把车停在大清真寺附近。我们进行了净化仪式，然后进去了。朝圣者似乎互相挤在一起，有这么多人，躺着、坐着、睡觉、祈祷、行走。
My vocabulary cannot describe the new mosque that was being built around the Ka'ba. I wasthrilled to realize that it was only one of the tremendous rebuilding tasks under the direction ofyoung Dr. Azzam, who had just been my host. The Great Mosque of Mecca, when it is finished,will surpass the architectural beauty of India's Taj Mahal. 
我的词汇无法描述正在卡巴周围建造的新清真寺。我很兴奋地意识到，这只是由刚刚成为我的东道主的年轻阿扎姆博士指导下的一项巨大的重建任务之一。当麦加大清真寺完工时，它将超越印度泰姬陵的建筑美。
Carrying my sandals, I followed the _Mutawaf_. Then I saw the Ka'ba, a huge black stone housein the middle of the Great Mosque. It was being circumambulated by thousands upon thousandsof praying pilgrims, both sexes, and every size, shape, color, and race in the world. I knew theprayer to be uttered when the pilgrim's eyes first perceive the Ka'ba. Translated, it is "O God, Youare peace, and peace derives from You. So greet us, O Lord, with peace." Upon entering theMosque, the pilgrim should try to kiss the Ka'ba if possible, but if the crowds prevent him gettingthat close, he touches it, and if the crowds prevent that, he raises his hand and cries out "Takbir!"("God is great!") I could not get within yards. "Takbir!" 
我拿着我的凉鞋，跟着_Mutawaf_走。然后我看到了卡巴，一个位于大清真寺中央的巨大黑色石头房子。成千上万的男女朝圣者绕着它转圈，他们有各种大小、形状、颜色和种族。我知道当朝圣者第一次看到卡巴时应该念什么祈祷文。翻译成中文是：“哦，上帝，你是和平的，和平源于你。所以，主啊，用和平来迎接我们吧。”进入清真寺后，如果可能的话，朝圣者应该尽量亲吻卡巴，但如果人群阻止他靠近，他就会触摸它，如果人群还阻止他，他就会举起手并高呼“Takbir!”（“真主伟大！”）我无法靠近几码之内。“Takbir!”
My feeling there in the House of God was a numbness. My _Mutawaf_ led me in the crowd ofpraying, chanting pilgrims, moving seven times around the Ka'ba. Some were bent and wizenedwith age; it was a sight that stamped itself on the brain. I saw incapacitated pilgrims being carriedby others. Faces were enraptured in their faith. The seventh time around, I prayed two _Rak'a_,prostrating myself, my head on the floor. The first prostration, I prayed the Quran verse "Say He isGod, the one and only"; the second prostration: "Say O you who are unbelievers, I worship notthat which you worship. . . ." 
在上帝的殿堂里，我的感觉是麻木的。我的_Mutawaf_带领我在祈祷、吟唱的朝圣者人群中，绕着卡巴转了七圈。有些人因年老而弯曲和枯萎；这是一幅深深地印在我的脑海中的景象。我看到行动不便的朝圣者被其他人抬着。他们的脸上充满了信仰的喜悦。第七圈时，我做了两次祷告，俯伏在地上，头贴在地板上。第一次俯伏时，我念了古兰经中的诗句：“说他是真主，唯一的真主”；第二次俯伏时：“你说啊，你们这些不信道的人，我不崇拜你们所崇拜的......”
As I prostrated, the _Mutawaf_ fended pilgrims off to keep me from being trampled. 
当我俯伏时，_Mutawaf_ 推开朝圣者，以免我被踩踏。
The _Mutawaf_ and I next drank water from the well of Zem Zem. Then we ran between the twohills, Safa and Marwa, where Hajar wandered over the same earth searching for water for herchild Ishmael. 
我和_Mutawaf_接下来喝了泽姆泽姆井里的水。然后我们在两座山之间奔跑，萨法和马尔瓦，哈吉尔在这里徘徊寻找水源给她的孩子伊斯梅尔喝水。
Three separate times, after that, I visited the Great Mosque and circumambulated the Ka'ba. Thenext day we set out after sunrise toward Mount Arafat, thousands of us, crying in unison:"Labbayka! Labbayka!" and "Allah Akbar!" Mecca is surrounded by the crudest-looking mountainsI have ever seen; they seem to be made of the slag from a blast furnace. No vegetation is onthem at all. Arriving about noon, we prayed and chanted from noon until sunset, and the_asr_(afternoon) and _Maghrib_ (sunset) special prayers were performed. 
在那之后，我分别三次参观了大清真寺并绕着卡巴转圈。第二天，我们在日出后向阿拉法特山出发，成千上万的人齐声高呼：“Labbayka! Labbayka!”和“Allah Akbar!”麦加被我所见过的最原始的山脉所环绕；它们看起来像是从鼓风炉中取出的渣滓。山上根本没有植被。大约在中午到达后，我们从中午一直祈祷和吟唱到日落，进行了_asr_（下午）和_Maghrib_（日落）的特殊祈祷仪式。
Finally, we lifted our hands in prayer and thanksgiving, repeating Allah's words: "There is no Godbut Allah. He has no partner. His are authority and praise. Good emanates from Him, and He haspower over all things." 
最后，我们举起双手祈祷和感恩，重复着真主的话语：“除了真主，再没有其他神。他没有同伴。他是权威和赞美。善从他而来，他对所有事物都有力量。”
Standing on Mount Arafat had concluded the essential rites of being a pilgrim to Mecca. No onewho missed it could consider himself a pilgrim. 
站在阿拉法特山上，朝觐麦加的基本仪式就结束了。任何错过它的人都不能认为自己是一名朝圣者。
The _Ihram_ had ended. We cast the traditional seven stones at the devil. Some had their hairand beards cut. I decided that I was going to let my beard remain. I wondered what my wife Betty,and our little daughters, were going to say when they saw me with a beard, when I got back toNew York. New York seemed a million miles away. I hadn't seen a newspaper that I could readsince I left New York. I had no idea what was happening there. A Negro rifle club that had been inexistence for over twelve years in Harlem had been "discovered" by the police; it was beingtrumpeted that I was "behind it." Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam had a lawsuit going againstme, to force me and my family to vacate the house in which we lived on Long Island. 
朝圣仪式结束了。我们按照传统向魔鬼投掷了七块石头。有些人剪掉了头发和胡须。我决定让我的胡须留着。我想知道当我回到纽约时，我的妻子贝蒂和小女儿们看到我留着胡子会说什么。纽约似乎在一百万里之外。自从离开纽约以来，我没有看到一份可以阅读的报纸。我不知道那里发生了什么事。一个在哈莱姆已经存在了十二年以上的黑人步枪俱乐部被警察“发现”了；他们大肆宣扬我是“幕后主使”。伊利亚·穆罕默德的国家伊斯兰组织对我提出了诉讼，迫使我和我的家人搬离我们在长岛居住的房子。
The major press, radio, and television media in America had representatives in Cairo hunting allover, trying to locate me, to interview me about the furor in New York that I had allegedly caused- when I knew nothing about any of it. 
美国的主要新闻、广播和电视媒体在开罗都有代表，到处搜寻我，试图找到我，就我在纽约引起的轰动采访我— —尽管我对这一切一无所知。
I only knew what I had left in America, and how it contrasted with what I had found in the Muslimworld. About twenty of us Muslims who had finished the Hajj were sitting in a huge tent on MountArafat. As a Muslim from America, I was the center of attention. They asked me what about theHajj had impressed me the most. One of the several who spoke English asked; they translatedmy answers for the others. My answer to that question was not the one they expected, but itdrove home my point.I said, "The _brotherhood_! The people of all races, colors, from all over the world comingtogether as _one_! It has proved to me the power of the One God." 
我只知道我已经离开了美国，以及它与我在穆斯林世界所发现的东西之间的对比。我们大约二十名已经完成朝觐的穆斯林坐在阿拉法特山上的一个巨大帐篷里。作为来自美国的穆斯林，我是众人关注的焦点。他们问我什么让朝觐给我留下了最深刻的印象。其中一位会说英语的人问道；他们将我的回答翻译成其他人的语言。我对这个问题的回答并不是他们所期望的，但它却表达了我的观点。我说：“兄弟情谊！来自世界各地的各种族、肤色的人们聚集在一起，成为了一个整体！这向我证明了唯一真主的力量。”
It may have been out of taste, but that gave me an opportunity, and I used it, to preach them aquick little sermon on America's racism, and its evils. 
这可能是出于无意，但这给了我一个机会，我利用了这个机会，向他们快速地宣讲了美国种族主义及其罪恶。
I could tell the impact of this upon them. They had been aware that the plight of the black man inAmerica was "bad," but they had not been aware that it was inhuman, that it was a psychologicalcastration. These people from elsewhere around the world were shocked. As Muslims, they had avery tender heart for all unfortunates, and very sensitive feelings for truth and justice. And ineverything I said to them, as long as we talked, they were aware of the yardstick that I was usingto measure everything-that to me the earth's most explosive and pernicious evil is racism, theinability of God's creatures to live as One, especially in the Western world. 
我可以感受到这对他们的影响。他们知道美国黑人的困境很“糟糕”，但他们不知道这是不人道的，这是一种心理上的阉割。来自世界各地的这些人感到震惊。作为穆斯林，他们对所有的不幸者都有一颗非常柔软的心，对真理和正义有着非常敏感的感觉。在我对他们说的每一句话中，只要我们交谈，他们就能感受到我用来衡量一切的标准——对我来说，地球上最具爆炸性和危害性的邪恶是种族主义，即上帝的创造物无法作为一个整体生活在一起，尤其是在西方世界。
*     *     * 
I have reflected since that the letter I finally sat down to compose had been subconsciouslyshaping itself in my mind. 
后来我想，我最终坐下来写的那封信，其实在我潜意识里已经成型了。
The _color-blindness_ of the Muslim world's religious society and the _color-blindness_ of theMuslim world's human society: these two influences had each day been making a greater impact,and an increasing persuasion against my previous way of thinking.The first letter was, of course, to my wife, Betty. I never had a moment's question that Betty, afterinitial amazement, would change her thinking to join mine. I had known a thousand reassurancesthat Betty's faith in me was total. Iknew that she would see what I had seen-that in the land ofMuhammad and the land of Abraham, I had been blessed by Allah with a new insight into the truereligion of Islam, and a better understanding of America's entire racial dilemma. 
穆斯林世界宗教社会的“色盲”和穆斯林世界人类社会的“色盲”：这两种影响每天都在产生更大的影响，并且越来越说服我改变以前的思维方式。当然，第一封信是给我的妻子贝蒂。我从未怀疑过贝蒂在最初的惊讶之后会改变她的思维方式来加入我的行列。我知道贝蒂对我完全信任。我知道她会看到我所看到的东西——在穆罕默德和亚伯拉罕的土地上，真主赐予我一种新的洞察力，让我更好地理解伊斯兰教的真正信仰，并更好地理解美国整个种族困境。
After the letter to my wife, I wrote next essentially the same letter to my sister Ella. And I knewwhere Ella would stand. She had been saving to make the pilgrimage to Mecca herself. 
在给我妻子的信之后，我基本上写了一封相同的信给我的妹妹艾拉。我知道艾拉会站在哪一边。她一直在存钱，准备自己去麦加朝圣。
I wrote to Dr. Shawarbi, whose belief in my sincerity had enabled me to get a passport to Mecca. 
我给Shawarbi博士写了信，他相信我的真诚，让我得到了去麦加的护照。
All through the night, I copied similar long letters for others who were very close to me. Amongthem was Elijah Muhammad's son Wallace Muhammad, who had expressed to me his convictionthat the only possible salvation for the Nation of Islam would be its accepting and projecting abetter understanding of Orthodox Islam. 
整个晚上，我为其他与我非常亲近的人抄写了类似的长信。其中包括伊利贾·穆罕默德的儿子华莱士·穆罕默德，他曾向我表达过他的信念，即伊斯兰民族唯一可能的救赎是接受并展示对正统伊斯兰教的更好理解。
And I wrote to my loyal assistants at my newly formed Muslim Mosque, Inc. in Harlem, with a noteappended, asking that my letter be duplicated and distributed to the press. 
我还给我在哈莱姆新成立的穆斯林清真寺公司的忠实助手们写了信，并附了一张便条，要求把我的信复印并分发给媒体。
I knew that when my letter became public knowledge back in America, many would beastounded-loved ones, friends, and enemies alike. And no less astounded would be millionswhom I did not know-who had gained during my twelve years with Elijah Muhammad a "hate"image of Malcolm X. 
我知道，当我的信在美国成为公众知识时，许多人会震惊——亲人、朋友和敌人都一样。同样震惊的还有数百万我不认识的人——他们在我和伊利贾·穆罕默德共事的十二年里，对我马尔科姆· X 形成了一种“仇恨”的形象。
Even I was myself astounded. But there was precedent in my life for this letter. My whole life hadbeen a chronology of-_changes_. 
即使我自己也感到震惊。但我的生命中已经有这封信的先例了。我的整个生命都是一系列变化的年表。
Here is what I wrote . . . from my heart:"Never have I witnessed such sincere hospitality and the overwhelming spirit of true brotherhoodas is practiced by people of all colors and races here in this Ancient Holy Land, the home ofAbraham, Muhammad, and all the other prophets of the Holy Scriptures. For the past week, Ihave been utterly speechless and spellbound by the graciousness I see displayed all around meby people _of all colors_. 
以下是我发自内心所写的内容：“我从未见过如此真诚的款待和真正的兄弟情谊，这种精神以下是我发自内心所写的内容：“我从未见过如此真诚的款待和真正的兄弟情谊，这种精神在这里被所有不同肤色和种族的人们所实践，这是古代圣地麦加，是亚伯拉罕、穆罕默德和其他神圣经文中的先知们的家园。在过去的一周里，我完全被周围所有人所展示出来的慷慨所震撼，这些人来自不同的肤色。”
"I have been blessed to visit the Holy City of Mecca. I have made my seven circuits around theKa'ba, led by a young _Mutawaf_ named Muhammad. I drank water from the well of Zem Zem. Iran seven times back and forth between the hills of Mt. Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. I have prayed inthe ancient city of Mina, and I have prayed on Mt. Arafat. 
“我很幸运能够参观麦加这个神圣的城市。我在一位名叫穆罕默德的年轻_Mutawaf_的带领下绕着Ka'ba走了七圈。我喝了Zem Zem井里的水，在Mt. Al-Safa和Al-Marwah的山丘之间来回走了七次。我在古老的城市Mina祈祷过，也在Mt. Arafat上祈祷过。”
"There were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, fromblue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual,displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believenever could exist between the white and the non-white. 
成千上万的朝圣者来自世界各地，他们有着不同的肤色，从蓝眼睛的金发碧眼到黑皮肤的非洲人。但我们都在参加同样的仪式，展现出一种团结和兄弟情谊的精神，这是我在美国的经历所让我相信的白人和非白人之间永远无法存在的。
"America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its societythe race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, and eveneaten with people who in America would have been considered 'white'-but the 'white' attitude wasremoved from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen _sincere_ and _true_brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color. 
“美国需要了解伊斯兰教，因为这是唯一一个能够消除其社会中种族问题的宗教。在我游历穆斯林世界的过程中，我遇到了、交谈过甚至与那些在美国被认为是“白人”的人一起吃饭——但是“白人”的态度被伊斯兰教从他们的脑海中抹去了。我以前从未见过所有不同肤色的人共同实践真诚和真正的兄弟情谊，无论他们的肤色如何。”
"You may be shocked by these words coming from me. But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen,and experienced, has forced me to _re-arrange_ much of my thought-patterns previously held,and to _toss aside_ some of my previous conclusions. This was not too difficult for me. Despitemy firm convictions, I havebeen always a man who tries to face facts, and to accept the reality oflife as new experience and new knowledge unfolds it. I have always kept an open mind, which isnecessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of intelligent search for truth. 
“你可能会因为我说出这些话而感到震惊。但是在这次朝圣中，我所看到和经历的事情迫使我重新安排了我先前持有的许多思维模式，并抛弃了我以前的一些结论。这对我来说并不太困难。尽管我有坚定的信念，但我始终是一个试图面对现实的人，并且随着新经验和新知识的展开接受生活的现实。我一直保持着开放的心态，这是与每一种形式的智能寻求真相所必须的灵活性并行的必要条件。
"During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunkfrom the same glass, and slept in the same bed (or on the same rug)-while praying to the sameGod-with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest ofblond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the _words_ and in the _actions_ and inthe _deeds_ of the 'white' Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black AfricanMuslims of Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana. 
“在过去的11天里，我在穆斯林世界中与那些眼睛最蓝、头发最金黄、皮肤最白皙的穆斯林一起吃饭、喝水、睡觉（或睡在同一张地毯上），同时向同一个上帝祈祷。在白人穆斯林的言语、行动和行为中，我感受到了与尼日利亚、苏丹和加纳的黑非洲穆斯林相同的真诚。”
"We were _truly_ all the same (brothers)-because their belief in one God had removed the 'white'from their _minds_, the 'white' from their _behavior_, and the 'white' from their _attitude_. 
“我们真的都是一样的（兄弟）——因为他们对一个上帝的信仰已经从他们的脑海中移除了‘白人’，从他们的行为中移除了‘白人’，从他们的态度中移除了‘白人’。”
"I could see from this, that perhaps if white Americans could accept the Oneness of God, thenperhaps, too, they could accept _in reality_ the Oneness of Man-and cease to measure, andhinder, and harm others in terms of their 'differences' in color. 
“从这一点上，我可以看到，也许如果美国白人可以接受上帝的一体性，那么也许他们“从这一点上，我可以看到，也许如果美国白人可以接受上帝的一体性，那么也许他们也可以真正地接受人类的一体性——不再以肤色的不同来衡量、阻碍和伤害他人。”
"With racism plaguing America like an incurable cancer, the so-called 'Christian' white Americanheart should be more receptive to a proven solution to such a destructive problem. Perhaps itcould be in time to save America from imminent disaster-the same destruction brought uponGermany by racism that eventually destroyed the Germans themselves. 
“种族主义像一种无法治愈的癌症一样困扰着美国，因此所谓的‘基督教’美国白人的心灵应该更加接受这种被证明可以解决这种破坏性问题的方法。也许还来得及挽救美国于即将到来的灾难——同样的种族主义带来的破坏，最终摧毁了德国人自己。”
"Each hour here in the Holy Land enables me to have greater spiritual insights into what ishappening in America between black and white. The American Negro never can be blamed for hisracial animosities-he is only reacting to fourhundred years of the conscious racism of theAmerican whites. But as racism leads America up the suicide path, I do believe, from theexperiences that I have had with them, that the whites of the younger generation, in the collegesand universities, will see the handwriting on the wall and many of them will turn to the _spiritual_path of _truth_-the _only_ way left to America to ward off the disaster that racism inevitably mustlead to. 
“在这片圣地的每一小时都让我更深入地了解美国黑人和白人之间正在发生的事情。美国黑人永远不会因为他的种族仇恨而受到指责——他只是对美国白人长达四百年的有意识的种族主义做出反应。但是，随着种族主义将美国推向自杀的道路，我相信，从我与他们的经历来看，年轻一代的白人，在大学里，将会看到墙上的文字，其中许多人将转向真理的精神之路——这是美国避免种族主义不可避免地带来的灾难的唯一途径。”
"Never have I been so highly honored. Never have I been made to feel more humble andunworthy. Who would believe the blessings that have been heaped upon an _American Negro_?A few nights ago, a man who would be called in America a 'white' man, a United Nationsdiplomat, an ambassador, a companion of kings, gave me _his_ hotel suite, _his_ bed. By thisman, His Excellency Prince Faisal, who rules this Holy Land, was made aware of my presencehere in Jedda. The very next morning, Prince Faisal's son, in person, informed me that by the willand decree of his esteemed father, I was to be a State Guest. 
“我从未受到如此高度的荣誉，也从未感到更加卑微和不值得。谁会相信美国黑人所受到的祝福？几天前，一个在美国被称为‘白人’的男人，一位联合国外交官、大使、国王的同伴，把他的酒店套房、他的床给了我。这位先生是统治这片圣地的费萨尔亲王殿下，他得知我在这里的存在。第二天早上，费萨尔亲王的儿子亲自告诉我，根据他父亲的意愿和命令，我将成为国家贵宾。”
"The Deputy Chief of Protocol himself took me before the Hajj Court. His Holiness SheikhMuhammad Harkon himself okayed my visit to Mecca. His Holiness gave me two books on Islam,with his personal seal and autograph, and he told me that he prayed that I would be a successfulpreacher of Islam in America. A car, a driver, and a guide, have been placed at my disposal,making it possible for me to travel about this Holy Land almost at will. The government providesair-conditioned quarters and servants in each city that I visit. Never would I have even thought ofdreaming that I would ever be a recipient of such honors-honors that in America would bebestowed upon a King-not a Negro. 
“外交部副部长亲自带我去了朝圣法庭。谢赫·穆罕默德·哈康圣人亲自批准了我的麦加之行。圣人给了我两本关于伊斯兰教的书，上面有他的个人印章和签名，他告诉我，他祈祷我能成为美国成功的伊斯兰教传教士。一辆汽车、一名司机和一名导游随时为我服务，使我能够几乎随心所欲地在这个圣地旅行。政府在我访问的每一个城市都提供空调房间和仆人。我从未想过自己会成为一个如此荣誉的接受者——在美国，这种荣誉只会被授予国王——而不是黑人。”

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
第十八章
EL-HAJJ MALIK EL-SHABAZZ 
EL-HAJJ MALIK EL-SHABAZZ（哈吉·马利克·沙巴兹）
Prince Faisal, the absolute ruler of Arabia, had made me a guest of the State. Among thecourtesies and privileges which this brought to me, especially-shamelessly-I relished thechauffeured car which toured me around in Mecca with the chauffeur-guide pointing out sights ofparticular significance. Some of the Holy City looked as ancient as time itself. Other parts of itresembled a modern Miami suburb. I cannot describe with what feelings I actually pressed myhands against the earth where the great Prophets had trod four thousand years before, 
费萨尔亲王，阿拉伯的绝对统治者，让我成为国家的客人。在这给我带来的特权中，尤其是——无耻地——我喜欢那辆豪华的汽车，它带着我在麦加四处游览，司机兼导游向我指出特别重要的景点。一些圣城看起来就像时间本身一样古老。它的其他部分就像一个现代化的迈阿密郊区。我无法描述我用手触摸4000年前伟大的先知们曾经踏过的土地时的感受。
"The Muslim from America" excited everywhere the most intense curiosity and interest. I wasmistaken time and again for Cassius Clay. A local newspaper had printed a photograph ofCassius and me together at the United Nations. Through my chauffeur-guide-interpreter I wasasked scores of questions about Cassius. Even children knew of him, and loved him there in theMuslim world. By popular demand, the cinemas throughout Africa and Asia had shown his fight.At that moment in young Cassius' career, he had captured the imagination and the support of theentire dark world. 
"来自美国的穆斯林"引起了各地最强烈的好奇心和兴趣。我一次又一次被误认为是卡修斯·克莱。当地一家报纸刊登了一张卡修斯和我一起在联合国的照片。通过我的司机兼导游兼翻译，我问了卡修斯的许多问题。即使在穆斯林世界，孩子们也知道他，爱他。应大众要求，整个非洲和亚洲的电影院都播放了他的比赛。在年轻的卡修斯职业生涯的这一刻，他赢得了整个黑暗世界的想象力和支持。
My car took me to participate in special prayers at Mt. Arafat, and at Mina. The roads offered thewildest drives that I had ever known: nightmare traffic, brakes squealing, skidding cars, and hornsblowing. (I believe that all of the driving in the Holy Land is done in the name of Allah.) I hadbegun to learnthe prayers in Arabic; now, my biggest prayer difficulty was physical. Theunaccustomed prayer posture had caused my big toe to swell, and it pained me. 
我的车带我去参加了在阿拉法特山和米拿的特别祈祷。这条路提供了我曾经知道的最疯狂的驾驶：噩梦般的交通，刹车尖叫，打滑的汽车和喇叭声。（我相信所有在圣地的驾驶都是以安拉的名义进行的。）我开始学习阿拉伯语的祈祷；现在，我最大的祈祷困难是身体上的。不习惯的祈祷姿势导致我的大脚趾肿胀，让我感到疼痛。
But the Muslim world's customs no longer seemed strange to me. My hands now readily pluckedup food from a common dish shared with brother Muslims; I was drinking without hesitation fromthe same glass as others; I was washing from the same little pitcher of water; and sleeping witheight or ten others on a mat in the open. I remember one night at Muzdalifa with nothing but thesky overhead I lay awake amid sleeping Muslim brothers and I learned that pilgrims from everyland-every color, and class, and rank; high officials and the beggar alike-all snored in the samelanguage. 
但是穆斯林世界的习俗对我来说不再陌生。现在我可以很自然地从和穆斯林兄弟们共用的普通盘子里夹起食物；我可以毫不犹豫地和别人共用同一个杯子喝水；我可以用同样的小水壶洗脸；我可以和八到十个人一起在户外的垫子上睡觉。我记得在穆扎德利法的一个晚上，除了头顶上的星空，我躺在熟睡的穆斯林兄弟中间，我意识到来自每个国家的朝圣者——各种肤色、阶级和地位的人都有；高官和乞丐都一样——他们都用同样的方式打鼾。
I'll bet that in the parts of the Holy Land that I visited a million bottles of soft drinks wereconsumed-and ten million cigarettes must have been smoked. Particularly the Arab Muslimssmoked constantly, even on the Hajj pilgrimage itself. The smoking evil wasn't invented inProphet Muhammad's days-if it had been, I believe he would have banned it. 
我敢打赌，在我去过的圣地的部分地方，有一百万瓶软饮料被消费了——而且肯定有一千万支香烟被抽掉了。特别是阿拉伯穆斯林不断地抽烟，甚至在哈吉朝圣期间也是如此。吸烟的恶习并不是在先知穆罕默德时代发明的——如果它是的话，我相信他会禁止它的。
It was the largest Hajj in history, I was later told. Kasem Gulek, of the Turkish Parliament,beaming with pride, informed me that from Turkey alone over six hundred buses-over fiftythousand Muslims-had made the pilgrimage. I told him that I dreamed to see the day whenshiploads and planeloads of American Muslims would come to Mecca for the Hajj. 
后来有人告诉我，这是历史上规模最大的一次朝觐。土耳其国会的卡萨姆·居莱克自豪地告诉我，仅从土耳其就有600多辆巴士——超过5万名穆斯林——参加了这次朝觐。我告诉他，我梦想着有一天能看到满载美国穆斯林的船只和飞机来到麦加参加朝觐。
There was a color pattern in the huge crowds. Once I happened to notice this, I closely observedit thereafter. Being from America made me intensely sensitive to matters of color. I saw thatpeople who looked alike drew together and most of the time stayed together. This was entirelyvoluntary; there being no other reason for it. But Africans were with Africans. Pakistanis were withPakistanis. And so on. I tucked it into my mind that when I returned home I would tell Americansthis observation; that where true brotherhood existed among all colors, where no one feltsegregated, where there was no "superiority" complex, no "inferiority" complex-then voluntarily,naturally, people of the same kind felt drawn together by that which they had in common. 
在庞大的人群中有一种颜色模式。有一次我偶然注意到了这一点，之后我就仔细观察了。来自美国的身份使我对颜色问题非常敏感。我看到长得相似的人聚在一起，大部分时间都呆在一起。这是完全自愿的；没有其他原因。但是非洲人只和非洲人在一起。巴基斯坦人只和巴基斯坦人在一起。以此类推。我把这个想法放在心里，当我回家时，我会告诉美国人这个观察结果；在所有颜色中真正的兄弟情谊存在的地方，没有人会感到被隔离，没有“优越”的情结，没有“自卑”的情结——那么自然而然地，人们会因为共同点而自然地聚集在一起。
It is my intention that by the time of my next Hajj pilgrimage, I will have at least a workingvocabulary of Arabic. In my ignorant, crippled condition in the Holy Land, I had been lucky to havemet patient friends who enabled me to talk by interpreting for me. Never before in my life had I feltso deaf and dumb as during the times when no interpreter was with me to tell me what was beingsaid around me, or about me, or even _to_ me, by other Muslims-before they learned that "theMuslim from America" knew only a few prayers in Arabic and, beyond that, he could only nod andsmile. 
我打算在我下一次朝觐时，至少掌握一些阿拉伯语的基本词汇。在圣地的无知和残疾状态下，我很幸运遇到了耐心的朋友，他们通过为我翻译来让我能够交谈。在我的生命中，从未有过像没有口译员在身边告诉我周围发生的事情、关于我的事情、甚至其他穆斯林对我说话的时候那样感到聋哑。在此之前，他们知道我只知道一些阿拉伯语的祈祷，除此之外，我只能点头微笑。
Behind my nods and smiles, though, I was doing some American-type thinking and reflection. Isaw that Islam's conversions around the world could double and triple if the colorfulness and thetrue spiritualness of the Hajj pilgrimage were properly advertised and communicated to theoutside world. I saw that the Arabs are poor at understanding the psychology of non-Arabs andthe importance of public relations. The Arabs said "_insha Allah_" ("God willing")-then they waitedfor converts. Even by this means, Islam was on the march, but I knew that with improved publicrelations methods the number of new converts turning to Allah could be turned into millions. 
然而，在我点头和微笑的背后，我正在做一些美国式的思考和反思。我看到如果朝觐的丰富多彩和真正的精神内涵得到适当的宣传和传达给外界，那么世界各地的伊斯兰教皈依者可能会成倍增加。我看到阿拉伯人不擅长理解非阿拉伯人的心理状态和公共关系的重要性。阿拉伯人说“_insha Allah_”（“真主保佑”）——然后他们等待皈依者的到来。即使通过这种方式，伊斯兰教也在前进，但我知道通过改进的公关方法，转向真主的新皈依者数量可以增加到数百万。
Constantly, wherever I went, I was asked questions about America's racial discrimination. Evenwith my background, I was astonished at the degree to which the major single image of Americaseemed to be discrimination. 
无论我走到哪里，人们总是问我关于美国种族歧视的问题。即使我有我的背景，我也对美国似乎主要是一个被歧视的形象感到惊讶。
In a hundred different conversations in the Holy Land with Muslims high and low, and from aroundthe world-and, later, when I got to Black Africa-I don't have to tell you never once did I bite mytongue or miss a single opportunity to tell the truth about the crimes, the evils and the indignitiesthat are suffered bythe black man in America. Through my interpreter, I lost no opportunity toadvertise the American black man's real plight. I preached it on the mountain at Arafat, I preachedit in the busy lobby of the Jedda Palace Hotel. I would point at one after another-to bring it closerto home; "You . . . you . . . you-because of your dark skin, in America you, too, would be called'Negro.' You could be bombed and shot and cattle-prodded and fire-hosed and beaten because ofyour complexions." 
在圣地与穆斯林高低不一的数百次交谈中，以及后来当我到达黑非洲时——我不必告诉你们，我从来没有咬过舌头或错过一次机会来告诉真相关于美国黑人所遭受的罪行、邪恶和屈辱。通过我的口译员，我没有错过任何宣传美国黑人真正困境的机会。我在阿拉法特山上宣扬它，我在杰达宫酒店繁忙的大堂里宣扬它。我会一个接一个地指出——让它更接近家庭；“你……你……你——因为你的黑皮肤，在美国你也会被叫做'黑鬼'。你可能会因为你的肤色而被炸死、枪杀、用牛棒子抽打、用消防水龙带喷水和殴打。”
As some of the poorest pilgrims heard me preach, so did some of the Holy World's mostimportant personages. I talked at length with the blue-eyed, blond-haired Hussein Amini, GrandMufti of Jerusalem. We were introduced on Mt. Arafat by Kasem Gulick of the Turkish Parliament.Both were learned men; both were especially well-read on America. Kasem Gulick asked me whyI had broken with Elijah Muhammad. I said that I preferred not to elaborate upon our differences,in the interests of preserving the American black man's unity. They both understood and acceptedthat. 
一些最贫穷的朝圣者听到了我的布道，一些圣地最重要的人物也听到了。我和蓝眼睛、金发的耶路撒冷大穆夫提侯赛因·阿米尼进行了长时间的交谈。我们在阿拉法特山被土耳其议会的卡萨姆·古利克介绍认识。他们都是学识渊博的人；都对美国特别了解。卡萨姆·古利克问我为什么与以利亚·穆罕默德决裂。我说为了维护美国黑人的团结，我宁愿不详细阐述我们之间的分歧。他们都理解和接受了这一点。
I talked with the Mayor of Mecca, Sheikh Abdullah Eraif, who when he was a journalist hadcriticized the methods of the Mecca municipality-and Prince Faisal made him the Mayor, to see ifhe could do any better. Everyone generally acknowledged that Sheikh Eraif was doing fine. Afilmed feature "The Muslim From America" was made by Ahmed Horyallah and his partner EssidMuhammad of Tunis' television station. In America once, in Chicago, Ahmed Horyallah hadinterviewed Elijah Muhammad. 
我和麦加市长谢赫·阿卜杜拉·伊利亚夫交谈过，他当记者时曾批评过麦加市政府的做法——费萨尔亲王让他当了市长，看看他是否能做得更好。大家普遍认为谢赫·伊利亚夫做得很好。突尼斯电视台的艾哈迈德·霍里亚拉和他的搭档埃西德·穆罕默德拍摄了一部名为《来自美国的穆斯林》的电影。艾哈迈德·霍里亚拉曾经在美国芝加哥采访过以利亚·穆罕默德。
The lobby of the Jedda Palace Hotel offered me frequent sizable informal audiences of importantmen from many different countries who were curious to hear the "American Muslim." I met manyAfricans who had either spent some time in America, or who had heard other Africans' testimonyabout America's treatment of the black man. I remember how before one large audience, onecabinet minister from Black Africa (he knew more about world-wide current eventsthan anyoneelse I've ever met) told of his occasionally traveling in the United States, North and South,deliberately not wearing his national dress. Just recalling the indignities he had met as a blackman seemed to expose some raw nerve in this highly educated, dignified official. His eyes blazedin his passionate anger, his hands hacked the air: "Why is the American black man so complacentabout being trampled upon? Why doesn't the American black man _fight_ to be a human being?" 
杰达宫酒店的大堂为我提供了许多不同国家的要人经常的、相当大的非正式观众，他们好奇地想听听“美国穆斯林”的话。我遇到了许多在美洲待过一段时间的非洲人，或者听到其他非洲人的证词关于美国对待黑人的方式。我记得在一个庞大的观众面前，一位来自黑非洲的内阁部长（他比我曾经遇到的任何人都更了解全球时事）讲述了他偶尔在美国旅行的经历，故意不穿他的民族服装。回想起他作为一个黑人所遭受的侮辱，似乎暴露了这个受过高等教育、有尊严的官员的某些神经末梢。他的眼睛因愤怒而燃烧，他的手在空中砍着：“为什么美国黑人对被践踏如此自满？为什么美国黑人不_战斗_成为一个人？”
A Sudanese high official hugged me, "You champion the American black people!" An Indianofficial wept in his compassion "for my brothers in your land." I reflected many, many times tomyself upon how the American Negro has been entirely brainwashed from ever seeing or thinkingof himself, as he should, as a part of the non-white peoples of the world. The American Negro hasno conception of the hundreds of millions of other non-whites' concern for him: he has noconception of their feeling of brotherhood for and with him. 
一位苏丹高级官员拥抱了我，“你是美国黑人的捍卫者！”一位印度官员悲痛欲绝地哭着说：“为了我在你们土地上的兄弟们。”我多次反思自己，美国黑人是如何被彻底洗脑的，从来没有像他应该做的那样，把自己看作是世界非白人的一部分。美国黑人对其他数以亿计的非白人对他的关心没有任何概念：他对他们对他的兄弟情谊没有任何概念。
It was there in the Holy Land, and later in Africa, that I formed a conviction which I have had eversince-that a topmost requisite for any Negro leader in America ought to be extensive traveling inthe non-white lands on this earth, and the travel should include many conferences with theranking men of those lands. I guarantee that any honest, open-minded Negro leader would returnhome with more effective thinking about alternative avenues to solutions of the American blackman's problem. Above all, the Negro leaders would find that many non-white officials of thehighest standing, especially Africans, would tell them-privately-that they would be glad to throwtheir weight behind the Negro cause, in the United Nations, and in other ways. But these officialsunderstandably feel that the Negro in America is so confused and divided that he doesn't himselfknow what his cause is. Again, it was mainly Africans who variously expressed to me that no onewould wish to be embarrassed trying to help a brother who shows no evidence that he wants thathelp-and who seems to refuse to cooperate in his own interests.The American black "leader's" most critical problem is lack of imagination! His thinking, hisstrategies, if any, are always limited, at least basically, to only that which is either advised, orapproved by the white man. And the first thing the American power structure doesn't want anyNegroes to start is thinking _internationally_. 
正是在圣地，后来在非洲，我形成了一个信念，从那时起一直存在——任何美国正是在圣地，后来在非洲，我形成了一个信念，从那时起一直存在——任何美国黑人领袖的最高要求应该是广泛地旅行到地球上的非白人地区，旅行应该包括与这些地区的高层人士举行多次会议。我保证任何诚实、开明的黑人领袖都会带着更有效地思考关于解决美国黑人问题的替代途径回国。最重要的是，黑人领袖会发现许多地位最高的非白人官员，特别是非洲人，会私下告诉他们，他们很乐意在美国黑人的事业中发挥影响力，包括在联合国和其他方面。但这些官员有理由认为美国的黑人如此困惑和分裂，以至于他自己都不知道自己的事业是什么。此外，主要是非洲人向我表达了各种各样的观点：没有人愿意在试图帮助一个没有表现出需要帮助迹象并且似乎拒绝为了自己的利益而合作的弟弟时感到尴尬。美国黑人“领袖”最关键问题是缺乏想象力！他的思考、策略（如果有的话）总是受到限制，至少基本上只限于被白人建议或批准的内容。而美国权力结构不希望任何黑人开始做的第一件事就是在国际上思考。
I think the single worst mistake of the American black organizations, and their leaders, is that theyhave failed to establish direct brotherhood lines of communication between the independentnations of Africa and the American black people. Why, every day, the black African heads of stateshould be receiving direct accounts of the latest developments in the American black man'sstruggles-instead of the U.S. State Department's releases to Africans which always imply that theAmerican black man's struggle is being "solved." 
我认为美国黑人组织及其领导人最大的错误是未能在独立的非洲国家和美国黑人之间建立直接的兄弟关系沟通渠道。为什么每天，非洲黑人国家的元首应该直接了解美国黑人斗争的最新进展，而不是从美国国务院向非洲发布的信息中获得暗示，即美国黑人的斗争正在“解决”。
Two American authors, best-sellers in the Holy Land, had helped to spread and intensify theconcern for the American black man. James Baldwin's books, translated, had made atremendous impact, as had the book _Black Like Me_, by John Griffin.  If you're unfamiliar withthat book, it tells how the white man Griffin blackened his skin and spent two months traveling asa Negro about America; then Griffin wrote of the experiences that he met. "A frighteningexperience!" I heard exclaimed many times by people in the Holy World who had read the popularbook. But I never heard it without opening their thinking further: "Well, if it was a frighteningexperience for him as nothing but a make-believe Negro for sixty days-then you think about what_real_ Negroes in America have gone through for four hundred years." 
两位美国作家在圣地成为畅销书，帮助传播和加强了对美国黑人的关注。詹姆斯·鲍德温的书被翻译成多种语言，产生了巨大的影响，约翰·格里芬的《像我一样黑》也是如此。如果你不熟悉这本书，它讲述了白人格里芬如何把皮肤变黑，并花了两个月时间作为黑人在美国旅行的经历；然后格里芬写下了他遇到的经历。“一次可怕的经历！”我在圣地听到许多读过这本流行书的人这样感叹。但我从来没有听到过他们不进一步思考：“嗯，如果这只是他作为一个六十天来扮演黑人的可怕经历——那么你可以想象一下真正的美国黑人四百年来所经历的一切。”
One honor that came to me, I had prayed for: His Eminence, Prince Faisal, invited me to apersonal audience with him. 
有一项荣誉是我祈求而来的：费萨尔亲王殿下邀请我与他私下会面。
As I entered the room, tall, handsome Prince Faisal came from behind his desk.I never will forgetthe reflection I had at that instant, that here was one of the world's most important men, and yetwith his dignity one saw clearly his sincere humility. He indicated for me a chair opposite from his.Our interpreter was the Deputy Chief of Protocol, Muhammad Abdul Azziz Maged, an Egyptian- born Arab, who looked like a Harlem Negro. 
当我走进房间时，高大英俊的费萨尔王子从桌子后面走了出来。我永远不会忘记那一刻的映像，这是一个世界上最重要的人物之一，然而他的尊严清楚地表明了他的真诚谦逊。他示意我在他对面的椅子上坐下。我们的翻译是礼宾部副部长穆罕默德·阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹·马吉德，一个出生在埃及的阿拉伯人，看起来像哈莱姆区的黑人。
Prince Faisal impatiently gestured when I began stumbling for words trying to express mygratitude for the great honor he had paid me in making me a guest of the State. It was onlyMuslim hospitality to another Muslim, he explained, and I was an unusual Muslim from America.He asked me to understand above all that whatever he had done had been his pleasure, with noother motives whatever. 
当我开始结结巴巴地试图表达我对他邀请我作为国家客人的感激之情时，费萨尔王子不耐烦地示意。他解释说，这只是穆斯林对另一个穆斯林的热情款待，而我是一个来自美国的不寻常的穆斯林。他要求我首先理解的是，无论他做了什么，都是出于他自己的意愿，没有任何其他动机。
A gliding servant served a choice of two kinds of tea as Prince Faisal talked. His son, MuhammadFaisal, had "met" me on American television while attending a Northern California university.Prince Faisal had read Egyptian writers' articles about the American "Black Muslims." "If whatthese writers say is true, the Black Muslims have the wrong Islam," he said. I explained my role ofthe previous twelve years, of helping to organize and to build the Nation of Islam. I said that mypurpose for making the Hajj was to get an understanding of true Islam. "That is good," PrinceFaisal said, pointing out that there was an abundance of English-translation literature aboutIslam-so that there was no excuse for ignorance, and no reason for sincere people to allowthemselves to be misled. 
一名滑行的仆人在费萨尔王子说话时提供了两种茶的选择。他的儿子穆罕默德·费萨尔在美国电视上看到了我，当时我正在加利福尼亚北部的一所大学就读。费萨尔王子读过埃及作家关于美国“黑人穆斯林”的文章。“如果这些作家说的是真的，那么黑人穆斯林信仰就是错误的伊斯兰教，”他说。我解释了过去十二年来我在帮助组织和建立伊斯兰国家方面所扮演的角色。我说，我去朝觐的目的是要了解真正的伊斯兰教。“那很好，”费萨尔王子指出，有大量的英文翻译的伊斯兰教文献——因此没有理由不了解它，也没有理由让真诚的人被误导。

The last of April, 1964, I flew to Beirut, the seaport capital of Lebanon. A part of me, I left behindin the Holy City of Mecca. And, in turn, I took away with me-forever-a part of Mecca. 
1964年4月底，我飞往黎巴嫩的海港首都贝鲁特。我把一部分留在了圣城麦加。而我也带走了一部分麦加，永远地带走了。
I was on my way, now, to Nigeria, then Ghana. But some friends I had made inthe Holy Land hadurged and insisted that I make some stops en route and I had agreed. For example, it had beenarranged that I would first stop and address the faculty and the students at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut. 
我当时正在去尼日利亚的路上，然后是加纳。但是在圣地结交的一些朋友敦促并坚持让我在途中停留一下，我同意了。例如，已经安排好了，我会先停下来在美国贝鲁特大学向教职员工和学生发表演讲。
In Beirut's Palm Beach Hotel, I luxuriated in my first long sleep since I had left America. Then, Iwent walking-fresh from weeks in the Holy Land: immediately my attention was struck by themannerisms and attire of the Lebanese women. In the Holy Land, there had been the verymodest, very feminine Arabian women-and there was this sudden contrast of the half-French,half-Arab Lebanese women who projected in their dress and street manners more liberty, moreboldness. I saw clearly the obvious European influence upon the Lebanese culture. It showed mehow any country's moral strength, or its moral weakness, is quickly measurable by the streetattire and attitude of its women-especially its young women. Wherever the spiritual values havebeen submerged, if not destroyed, by an emphasis upon the material things, invariably, thewomen reflect it. Witness the women, both young and old, in America-where scarcely any moralvalues are left. There seems in most countries to be either one extreme or the other. Truly aparadise could exist wherever material progress and spiritual values could be properly balanced. 
在贝鲁特的棕榈海滩酒店，我享受着我离开美国以来的第一次长时间睡眠。然后，我从圣地走了几个星期：立即引起了我对黎巴嫩妇女的举止和服饰的关注。在圣地，有非常谦虚、非常女性化的阿拉伯妇女——而突然之间，半法国、半阿拉伯的黎巴嫩妇女在她们的衣着和街头举止上表现出更多的自由和勇气。我清楚地看到了欧洲对黎巴嫩文化的影响。它向我展示了任何国家的道德力量或道德弱点如何通过其女性的街头服饰和态度迅速衡量出来——尤其是年轻女性。无论在哪里，如果精神价值观被强调物质的东西所淹没，甚至被摧毁，女性总是反映出来。在美国，无论是年轻的还是年老的女性都是如此——几乎没有留下任何道德价值观。似乎大多数国家都存在一个极端或另一个极端。真正的天堂可以在物质进步和精神价值得到适当平衡的地方存在。
I spoke at the University of Beirut the truth of the American black man's condition. I've previouslymade the comment that any experienced public speaker can feel his audience's reactions. As Ispoke, I felt the subjective and defensive reactions of the American white students present-butgradually their hostilities lessened as I continued to present the unassailable facts. But thestudents of African heritage-well, I'll _never_ get over how the African displays his emotions. 
我在贝鲁特大学讲述了美国黑人的真实状况。我以前曾评论过，任何有经验的公众演讲者都可以感受到听众的反应。当我讲话时，我感受到了在场的美国白人学生的主观和防御性反应——但随着我继续呈现不可动摇的事实，他们的敌意逐渐减弱。但是非洲裔学生——好吧，我永远不会忘记非洲人如何表达他的情感。
Later, with astonishment, I heard that the American press carried stories that my Beirut speechcaused a "riot." What kind of a riot? I don't know how any reporter, in good conscience, couldhave cabled that across the ocean. The Beirut _Daily Star_ front-page report of my speechmentioned no "riot"-because there was none. When I was done, the African students all butbesieged me for autographs; some of them even hugged me. Never have even American Negroaudiences accepted me as  I have been accepted time and again by the less inhibited, moredown-to-earth Africans. 
后来，我惊讶地听到美国媒体报道说我在贝鲁特的演讲引起了“骚乱”。什么样的骚乱？我不知道任何有良知的记者如何能够跨越大洋发出这样的电报。贝鲁特《每日星报》对我演讲的头版报道没有提到“骚乱”，因为根本没有发生。当我结束时，非洲学生几乎都围着我要签名；其中一些人甚至拥抱了我。即使是美国的黑人听众也没有像那些不受限制、更实际的非洲人那样多次接受过我。
From Beirut, I flew back to Cairo, and there I took a train to Alexandria, Egypt. I kept my camerabusy during each brief stopover. Finally I was on a plane to Nigeria. 
从贝鲁特，我飞回开罗，在那里我乘火车去了埃及的亚历山大。在每一个短暂的中途停留期间，我都让我的相机忙碌起来。最后我登上了去尼日利亚的飞机。
During the six-hour flight, when I was not talking with the pilot (who had been a 1960 Olympicsswimmer), I sat with a passionately political African. He almost shouted in his fervor. "Whenpeople are in a stagnant state, and are being brought out of it, there is no _time_ for voting!" Hiscentral theme was that no new African nation, trying to decolonize itself, needed any politicalsystem that would permit division and bickering. "The people don't know what the vote means! Itis the job of the enlightened leaders to raise the people's intellect." 
在六个小时的飞行中，当我不和飞行员（曾是一名1960年奥运会游泳选手）交谈时，我和一位充满激情的政治非洲人坐在一起。他几乎因热情而喊叫。“当人们处于停滞状态时，当他们被带出来时，没有时间投票！”他的核心主题是，没有一个试图摆脱殖民主义的新非洲国家需要任何允许分裂和争吵的政治制度。“人民不知道投票意味着什么！提高人民的智力是开明领导人的工作。”
In Lagos, I was greeted by Professor Essien-Udom of the Ibadan University. We were both happyto see each other. We had met in the United States as he had researched the Nation of Islam forhis book, _Black Nationalism_. At his home, that evening, a dinner was held in my honor,attended by other professors and professional people. As we ate, a young doctor asked me if Iknew that New York City's press was highly upset about a recent killing in Harlem of a whitewoman-for which, according to the press, many were blaming me at least indirectly. An elderlywhite couple who owned a Harlem clothing store had been attacked by several young Negroes,and the wife was stabbed to death. Some of these young Negroes, apprehended by the police,had described themselves as belonging to an organization they called "Blood Brothers." Theseyouths, allegedly, had said or implied that they were affiliated with "Black Muslims" whohad splitaway from the Nation of Islam to join u p with me. 
在拉各斯，我受到了伊巴丹大学的艾西恩-乌多姆教授的欢迎。我们都很高兴见到彼此。我们在美国见过面，因为他在他的书《黑人民族主义》中研究了伊斯兰国家。那天晚上，在他的家里，为了向我表示敬意，举行了一次晚宴，其他教授和专业人士也参加了。当我们吃饭时，一位年轻的医生问我是否知道纽约市的媒体对最近哈莱姆区一名白人妇女被杀一事感到非常不安——据媒体报道，许多人至少间接地将此事归咎于我。一对年迈的白人夫妇拥有一家哈莱姆服装店，他们遭到了几名年轻黑人的攻击，妻子被刺死。其中一些被警方逮捕的年轻黑人称自己属于一个他们称之为“血兄弟”的组织。这些年轻人据说曾说过或暗示过他们与“黑人穆斯林”有联系，后者已经从伊斯兰国家分裂出来加入我的组织。
I told the dinner guests that it was my first word of any of it, but that I was not surprised whenviolence happened in any of America's ghettoes where black men had been living packed likeanimals and treated like lepers. I said that the charge against me was typical white manscapegoat-seeking-that whenever something white men disliked happened in the blackcommunity, typically white public attention was directed not at the cause, but at a selectedscapegoat. 
我告诉晚宴的客人们，这是我第一次听到这样的事情，但当暴力事件发生在美国任何贫民窟时，我并不感到惊讶，因为黑人男子像动物一样被挤在一起生活，并像麻风病人一样被对待。我说，针对我的指控是典型的白人寻找替罪羊——每当黑人社区发生白人不喜欢的事情时，通常白人公众的注意力不是指向原因，而是指向一个选定的替罪羊。
As for the "Blood Brothers," I said I considered all Negroes to be my blood brothers. I said thatthe white man's efforts to make my name poison actually succeeded only in making millions ofblack people regard me like Joe Louis. 
至于“血兄弟”，我说我认为所有黑人都是我的血兄弟。我说白人试图让我的名字变得有毒的努力实际上只成功地让数百万黑人像乔·路易斯一样看待我。
Speaking in the Ibadan University's Trenchard Hall, I urged that Africa's independent nationsneeded to see the necessity of helping to bring the Afro-American's case before the UnitedNations. I said that just as the American Jew is in political, economic, and cultural harmony withworld Jewry, I was convinced that it was time for all Afro-Americans to join the world's Pan- Africanists. I said that physically we Afro-Americans might remain in America, fighting for ourConstitutional rights, but that philosophically and culturally we Afro-Americans badly needed to"return" to Africa-and to develop a working unity in the framework of Pan-Africanism. 
在伊巴丹大学的特伦查德大厅发表演讲时，我敦促非洲的独立国家有必要帮助将非裔美国人的案件提交给联合国。我说，就像美国犹太人在政治上、经济上和文化上与世界犹太人和谐相处一样，我相信现在是所有非裔美国人加入世界泛非主义者的时候了。我说，从身体上讲，我们非裔美国人可能仍然留在美国，为我们宪法权利而战，但从哲学和文化上讲，我们非裔美国人迫切需要“回归”非洲——并在泛非主义框架内发展一种有效的团结。
Young Africans asked me politically sharper questions than one hears from most American adults.Then an astonishing thing happened when one old West Indian stood and began attacking me-forattacking America. "Shut up! Shut up!" students yelled, booing, and hissing. The old West Indiantried to express defiance of them, and in a sudden rush a group of students sprang up and wereafter him. He barely escaped ahead of them. I never saw anything like it. Screaming at him, theyran him off the campus. (Later, I found out that the oldWest Indian was married to a white woman,and he was trying to get a job i n some white-influenced agency which had put him up tochallenge me. Then, I understood his problem.) 
年轻的非洲人向我提出了比大多数美国成年人更尖锐的政治问题。然后发生了一件令人惊讶的事情，一个年迈的西印度人站起来开始攻击我——因为我攻击了美国。“闭嘴！闭嘴！”学生们喊道，发出嘘声和嘶嘶声。这位年迈的西印度人试图表达对他们的蔑视，突然一群学生跳起来追赶他。他在他们前面勉强逃脱了。我从未见过这样的事情。他们尖叫着把他赶出了校园。（后来，我发现这位年迈的西印度人与一位白人女性结婚，他试图在一些受白人影响的机构找到一份工作，这些机构让他挑战我。然后，我理解了他的问题。）
This wasn't the last time I'd see the Africans' almost fanatic expression of their political emotions. 
这不是我最后一次看到非洲人几乎狂热地表达他们的政治情感。
Afterward, in the Students' Union, I was plied with questions, and I was made an honorarymember of the Nigerian Muslim Students' Society. Right here in my wallet is my card: "AlhadjiMalcolm X. Registration No. M-138." With the membership, I was given a new name: "Omowale."It means, in the Yoruba language, "the son who has come home." I meant it when I told them Ihad never received a more treasured honor. 
之后，在学生会里，我被问了很多问题，并被授予尼日利亚穆斯林学生协会的荣誉会员。就在我钱包里有我的卡片：“Alhadji Malcolm X.注册号M-138。”随着会员身份，我得到了一个新名字：“Omowale”。在约鲁巴语中，它的意思是“回家的儿子”。当我说这是我从未收到过的最珍贵的荣誉时，我是认真的。
Six hundred members of the Peace Corps were in Nigeria, I learned. Some white Peace Corpsmembers who talked with me were openly embarrassed at the guilt of their race in America.Among the twenty Negro Peace Corpsmen I talked with, a very impressive fellow to me was LarryJackson, a Morgan State 
我了解到，有600名和平队成员在尼日利亚。一些白人和平队成员与我交谈时，公开表示对他们的种族在美国所犯的罪行感到尴尬。在我交谈过的20名黑人和平队队员中，一个给我留下深刻印象的人是拉里·杰克逊，他来自摩根州立大学
College graduate from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who had joined the Peace Corps in 1962. 
他是一名来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡的大学毕业生，于1962年加入和平队。
I made Nigerian radio and television program appearances. When I remember seeing black menoperating their _own_ communications agencies, a thrill still runs up my spine. The reporters whointerviewed me included an American Negro from _Newsweek_ magazine-his name wasWilliams. Traveling through Africa, he had recently interviewed Prime Minister Nkrumah. 
我出现在了尼日利亚的广播和电视节目中。当我想起看到黑人经营自己的通讯机构时，仍然会感到一阵激动。采访我的记者包括一名来自《新闻周刊》杂志的美国黑人——他的名字叫威廉姆斯。他最近在非洲旅行期间采访了恩克鲁玛总理。
Talking with me privately, one group of Nigerian officials told me how skillfully the U.S. InformationAgency sought to spread among Africans the impression that American Negroes were steadilyadvancing, and that the race problemsoon would be solved. One high official told me, "Ourinformed leaders and many, many others know otherwise." He said that behind the "diplomaticfront" of every African U.N. official was recognition of the white man's gigantic duplicity andconspiracy to keep the world's peoples of African heritage separated-both physically andideologically-from each other. 
一群尼日利亚官员私下里与我交谈，告诉我美国情报机构如何巧妙地试图在非洲人中传播美国黑人正在稳步前进的印象，以及种族问题将很快得到解决。一位高级官员告诉我：“我们了解情况的领导人和许多人都知道事实并非如此。”他说，在每个非洲联合国官员的“外交阵线”背后，是对白人巨大欺骗和阴谋的认识，以保持世界上拥有非洲血统的人们彼此分开——无论是在身体上还是在意识形态上。
"In your land, how many black people think about it that South and Central and North Americacontain over _eighty million_ people of African descent?" he asked me. 
“在你的国家，有多少黑人想到南、中、北美洲有8000多万非洲裔人口？”他问我。
"The world's course will change the day the African-heritage peoples come together as brothers!" 
“当非洲裔人民团结在一起成为兄弟的那一天，世界将发生改变！”
I never had heard that kind of global black thinking from any black man in America. 
我从未在美国任何黑人那里听到过这种全球黑人思维。
From Lagos, Nigeria, I flew on to Accra, Ghana. 
我从尼日利亚的拉各斯飞往加纳的阿克拉。
I think that nowhere is the black continent's wealth and the natural beauty of its people richer thanin Ghana, which is so proudly the very fountainhead of Pan-Africanism. 
我认为，在加纳这个泛非主义的发源地，没有任何地方比加纳更富有黑人大陆的财富和人民的自然美。
I stepped off the plane into a jarr ing note. A red-faced American white man recognized me; hehad the nerve to come up grabbing my hand and telling me in a molasses drawl that he was fromAlabama, and then he invited me to his home for dinner! 
我走下飞机，听到了一阵刺耳的声音。一个红脸的美国白人认出了我；他竟然有胆量走过来抓住我的手，用慢吞吞的语调告诉我他是来自阿拉巴马州，然后邀请我去他家吃晚饭！
My hotel's dining room, when I went to breakfast, was full of more of those whites-discussingAfrica's untapped wealth as though the African waiters had no ears. It nearly ruined my meal,thinking how in America they sicked police dogs on black people, and threw bombs in blackchurches, while blocking thedoors of their white churches-and now, once again in the land wheretheir forefathers had stolen blacks and thrown them into slavery, was that white man. 
当我去吃早餐时，酒店的餐厅里充满了那些白人——讨论着非洲未开发的财富，仿佛非洲侍者没有耳朵一样。这几乎毁了我的用餐体验，我不禁想到在美国他们如何对待黑人——用警犬追捕、在黑人教堂里扔炸弹，同时封锁他们的白人教堂的大门——而现在，在这个他们的祖先曾经偷走黑人并将他们投入奴隶制的地方，又是这些白人。
Right there at my Ghanaian breakfast table was where I made up my mind that as long as I wasin Africa, every time I opened my mouth, I was going to make things hot for that white man,grinning through his teeth wanting to exploit Africa again-it had been her human wealth the lasttime, now he wanted Africa's mineral wealth. 
就在我加纳的早餐桌上，我下定决心，只要我在非洲，每次我开口说话，我都会为那些白人制造麻烦，他们咬牙咧嘴地想再次剥削非洲——上一次是她的人力资源，现在他想要非洲的矿产资源。
And I knew that my reacting as I did presented no conflict with the convictions of brotherhoodwhich I had gained in the Holy Land. The Muslims of "white" complexions who had changed myopinions were men who had showed me that they practiced genuine brotherhood. And I knew thatany American white man with a genuine brotherhood for a black man was hard to find, no matterhow much he grinned. 
我知道我的反应与我在圣地获得的兄弟情谊的信念并不矛盾。那些改变了我的观点的“白人”穆斯林是向我展示他们实践真正的兄弟情谊的人。而且我知道，任何真正对黑人有兄弟情谊的美国白人都很难找到，无论他多么咧嘴笑。
The author Julian Mayfield seemed to be the leader of Ghana's little colony of Afro-Americanexpatriates. When I telephoned Mayfield, in what seemed no time at all I was sitting in his homesurrounded by about forty black American expatriates; they had been waiting for my arrival. Therewere business and professional people, such as the militant former Brooklynites Dr. and Mrs.Robert E. Lee, both of them dentists, who had given up their United States' citizenship. Suchothers as Alice Windom, Maya Angelou Make, Victoria Garvin, and Leslie Lacy had even formeda "Malcolm X Committee" to guide me through a whirlwind calendar of appearances and socialevents. 
作者朱利安·梅菲尔德似乎是加纳的非裔美国侨民小殖民地的领袖。当我打电话给梅菲尔德时，似乎没有多长时间我就坐在他的家里，周围有大约四十个美国黑人侨民；他们已经在等我的到来。其中有商人和专业人士，例如激进的前布鲁克林人罗伯特·李博士和夫人，他们都是牙医，已经放弃了他们的美国国籍。其他人如艾丽丝·温多姆、玛雅·安吉洛·马克、维多利亚·加文和莱斯利·莱西甚至成立了一个“马尔科姆X委员会”，在我旋风般的日程安排和社会活动中指导我。
In my briefcase here are some of the African press stories which had appeared when it waslearned that I was en route: 
在我的公文包里，有一些非洲媒体的报道，当我得知我正在途中时，它们已经出现了：
"Malcolm X's name is almost as familiar to Ghanaians as the Southern dogs, fire hoses, cattleprods, people sticks, and the ugly, hate-contorted white faces. . . .""Malcolm X's decision to enter the mainstream of the struggle heralds a hopeful sign on thesickeningly dismal scene of brutalized, non-violent, passive resistance. . . ." 
"马尔科姆X的名字对加纳人来说几乎和南方的狗、消防水带、牛棒、人棍以及丑陋、仇恨扭曲的白人面孔一样熟悉……" "马尔科姆X决定进入斗争的主流，预示着在这个令人作呕的沉闷场景中，被残酷对待的非暴力被动抵抗出现了一线希望……"
"An extremely important fact is that Malcolm X is the first Afro-American leader of nationalstanding to make an independent trip to Africa since Dr. Du Bois came to Ghana. This may be thebeginning of a new phase in our struggle. Let's make sure we don't give it less thought than theState Department is doubtless giving it right now." 
"一个极其重要的事实是，马尔科姆X是自杜博斯博士来到加纳以来，第一位具有国家地位的非裔美国领导人独立访问非洲。这可能是我们斗争中新阶段的开始。让我们确保我们不会比国务院现在所给予的更少地思考这个问题。"
And another: "Malcolm X is one of our most significant and militant leaders. We are in a battle.Efforts will be made to malign and discredit him. . . ." 
还有一篇报道说："马尔科姆X是我们最重要和最富有战斗精神的领导人之一。我们正处于一场战斗中。将会出现诋毁他的努力……"
I simply couldn't believe this kind of reception five thousand miles from America! The officials ofthe press had even arranged to pay my hotel expenses, and they would hear no objection that Imade. They included T. D. Baffoe, the Editor-in-Chief of the _Ghanaian Times_; G. T. Anim, theManaging Director of the Ghana News Agency; Kofi Batsa, the Editor of _Spark_ and theSecretary-General of the Pan-African Union of Journalists; and Mr. Cameron Duodu; and others. Icould only thank them all. Then, during the beautiful dinner which had been prepared by JulianMayfield's pretty Puerto Rican wife, Ana Livia (she was in charge of Accra's district healthprogram), I was plied with questions by the eagerly interested black expatriates from Americawho had returned to Mother Africa. 
我简直不敢相信，在离美国五千英里的地方会有这样的接待！新闻官员甚至安排支付我的酒店费用，他们不会接受我提出的任何反对意见。他们包括加纳时报的主编T.D.巴福；加纳通讯社总经理G.T.阿尼姆；火花编辑和泛非记者联盟秘书长科菲·巴塔；卡梅伦·杜多先生等人。我只能感谢他们所有人。然后，在由朱利安·梅菲尔德漂亮的波多黎各妻子安娜·莉维娅（她负责阿克拉地区的卫生计划）准备的美味晚餐期间，来自美国回到非洲母亲的黑人侨民充满热情地向我提出了问题。
I can only wish that every American black man could have shared my ears, my eyes, and myemotions throughout the round of engagements which had been made for me in Ghana. And mypoint in saying this is not the reception that I personally received as an individual of whom theyhad heard, but it was thereception tendered to me as the symbol of the militant American blackman, as I had the honor to be regarded. 
我只能说，我希望每个美国黑人都能分享我在加纳所经历的一切。我说这番话的目的并不是我个人作为他们听说过的人所受到的接待，而是我有幸被视为美国黑人战斗精神的象征而受到的接待。
At a jam-packed press club conference, I believe the very first question was why had I split withElijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. The Africans had heard such rumors as that ElijahMuhammad had built a palace in Arizona. I straightened out that falsehood, and I avoided anycriticism. I said that our disagreement had been in terms of political direction and involvement inthe extra-religious struggle for human rights. I said I respected the Nation of Islam for its havingbeen a psychologically revitalizing movement and a source of moral and social reform, and thatElijah Muhammad's influence upon the American black man had been basic. 
在一个挤满人的新闻俱乐部会议上，我相信第一个问题是为什么我与以利亚·穆罕默德和伊斯兰国家分裂。非洲人听说过这样的谣言，说以利亚·穆罕默德在亚利桑那州建造了一座宫殿。我澄清了这个谎言，避免了任何批评。我说我们的分歧在于政治方向和参与非宗教的人权斗争。我说我尊重伊斯兰国家，因为它是一个心理上振兴的运动，是道德和社会改革的源泉，而以利亚·穆罕默德对美国黑人的影响是基本的。
I stressed to the assembled press the need for mutual communication and support between theAfricans and Afro-Americans whose struggles were interlocked. I remember that in the pressconference, I used the word "Negro," and I was firmly corrected. "The word is not favored here,Mr. Malcolm X. The term Afro-American has greater meaning, and dignity." I sincerely apologized.I don't think that I said "Negro" again as long as I was in Africa. I said that the 22 million Afro- Americans in the United States could become for Africa a great positive force-while, in turn, theAfrican nations could and should exert positive force at diplomatic levels against America's racialdiscrimination. I said, "All of Africa unites in opposition to South Africa's apartheid, and to theoppression in the Portuguese territories. But you waste your time if you don't realize thatVerwoerd and Salazar, and Britain and France, never could last a day if it were not for UnitedStates support. So until you expose the man in Washington, D.C., you haven't accomplishedanything." 
我向聚集在一起的媒体强调，非洲人和非洲裔美国人之间需要相互沟通和支持，他们的斗争是相互关联的。我记得在新闻发布会上，我用了“黑鬼”这个词，我被坚决地纠正了。“马尔科姆·X先生，这个词在这里不受欢迎。非裔美国人这个词有更大的含义和尊严。”我真诚地道歉。我想只要我在非洲，我就不会再说“黑人”这个词了。我说，在美国的2200万非洲裔美国人可以成为非洲的一支巨大的积极力量，而反过来，非洲国家可以而且应该在外交层面上发挥积极力量，反对美国的种族歧视。我说，整个非洲团结起来，反对南非的种族隔离制度，反对葡萄牙领土上的压迫。但是，如果你没有意识到，如果没有美国的支持，维沃尔德和萨拉查，以及英国和法国，永远不会持续一天，那你就是在浪费时间。所以在你揭露华盛顿特区的那个人之前，你还没有完成任何事情。
I knew that the State Department's G. Mennen Williams was officially visiting in Africa. I said,"Take my word for it-you be suspicious of all these American officials who come to Africa grinningin your faces when they don't grin in oursback home." I told them that my own father wasmurdered by whites in the state of Michigan where G. Mennen Williams once was the Governor. 
我知道国务院的G·门南·威廉姆斯正在非洲进行正式访问。我说：“相信我的话——当这些美国人在你们面前咧嘴笑时，你们应该怀疑他们，因为他们在我们国家时可不会这样笑。”我告诉他们，我自己的父亲就是在密歇根州被白人谋杀的，而G·门南·威廉姆斯曾经是该州的州长。
I was honored at the Ghana Club, by more press representatives and dignitaries. I was the guestat the home of the late black American author Richard Wright's daughter, beautiful, slender, soft- voiced Julia, whose young French husband publishes a Ghanaian paper. Later, in Paris, I was tomeet Richard Wright's widow, Ellen, and a younger daughter, Rachel. 
在加纳俱乐部，我受到了更多的新闻代表和政要的欢迎。我是已故美国黑人作家理查德·赖特的女儿朱莉娅的客人，她美丽、苗条、声音柔和，她的年轻的法国丈夫出版了一份加纳报纸。后来，在巴黎，我见到了理查德·赖特的妻子艾伦和一个年轻的女儿瑞秋。
I talked with Ambassadors, at their embassies. The Algerian Ambassador impressed me as aman who was dedicated totally to militancy, and to world revolution, as the way to solve theproblems of the world's oppressed masses. His perspective was attuned not just to Algerians, butto include the Afro-Americans and all others anywhere who were oppressed. The ChineseAmbassador, Mr. Huang Ha, a most perceptive, and also most militant man, focused upon theefforts of the West to divide Africans from the peoples of African heritage elsewhere. The NigerianAmbassador was deeply concerned about the Afro-Americans' plight in America. He had personalknowledge of their suffering, having lived and studied in Washington, D.C. Similarly, the mostsympathetic Mali Ambassador had been in New York at the United Nations. I breakfasted with Dr.Makonnen of British Guiana. We discussed the need for the type of Pan-African unity that wouldalso include the Afro-Americans. And I had a talk in depth about Afro-American problems withNana Nketsia, the Ghanaian Minister of Culture. 
我在他们的大使馆里与大使们交谈。阿尔及利亚大使给我留下了深刻的印象，他完全致力于战斗和世界革命，认为这是解决世界上受压迫群众问题的方法。他的观点不仅适用于阿尔及利亚人，还包括所有受压迫的非洲裔美国人和其他任何地方的人。中国大使黄华先生是一位非常有洞察力、也非常有战斗力的人，他关注的是西方试图将非洲人与其他非洲后裔国家分开的努力。尼日利亚大使非常关心美国非裔美国人的困境。他在华盛顿特区生活和学习过，亲身经历了他们的痛苦。同样，最同情的马里大使曾在纽约联合国总部工作。我和英属圭亚那的Makonnen博士一起吃早餐，讨论了泛非团结的必要性，这种团结也应该包括非裔美国人。我还与加纳文化部长Nana Nketsia深入讨论了非裔美国人的问题。
Once when I returned to my hotel, a New York City call was waiting for me from Mai Goode of theAmerican Broadcasting Company. Over the telephone Mai Goode asked me questions that Ianswered for his beeping tape recorder, about the "Blood Brothers" in Harlem, the rifle clubs forNegroes, and other subjects with which I was being kept identified in the American press. 
有一次，当我回到旅馆时，美国广播公司的梅·古德从纽约市给我打来电话。在电话中，梅·古德向我提问，我回答了他的录音机，关于哈莱姆的“血兄弟” 、黑人步枪俱乐部和其他一些在美国新闻界与我联系在一起的话题。
  In the University of Ghana's Great Hall, I addressed the largest audience that I would in Africa- mostly Africans, but also numerous whites. Before this audience, I tried my best to demolish thefalse image of American race relations that I knew was spread by the U.S. Information Agency. Itried to impress upon them all the true picture of the Afro-American's plight at the hands of thewhite man. I worked on those whites there in the audience: 
 在加纳大学的大厅里，我向大多数非洲人、但也有许多白人发表了我在非洲演讲中最多的一次演讲。在这个听众面前，我尽了最大的努力来推翻美国情报局传播的关于美国种族关系的虚假形象。我试图让他们了解非裔美国人在白人手中的困境的真实情况。我努力说服那些在场的白人：
"I've never _seen_ so many whites so nice to so many blacks as you white people here in Africa.In America, Afro-Americans are struggling for integration. They should come here-to Africa-andsee how you grin at Africans. You've really got integration here. But can you tell the Africans thatin America you grin at the black people? No, you can't! And you don't honestly like these Africansany better, either-but what you _do_ like is the _minerals_ Africa has under her soil. . . ." 
“我从来没有见过像在非洲这里的白人对这么多黑人这么好的白人。在美国，非裔美国人正在为融入社会而奋斗。他们应该来到这里——到非洲——看看你们是如何咧嘴笑着面对非洲人的。你们在这里真的实现了融合。但是你能告诉非洲人在美国你们对黑人咧嘴笑吗？不，你不能！而且你也不真正喜欢这些非洲人——但是你确实喜欢的是非洲地下的矿产资源…… ”
Those whites out in the audience turned pink and red. They knew I was telling the truth. "I'm notanti-American, and I didn't come here to _condemn_ America-I want to make that very clear!" Itold them. "I came here to tell the truth-and if the _truth_ condemns America, then she standscondemned!" 
 听众中的白人变得脸色发红。他们知道我说的是实话。“我不是反美的，我来这不是要谴责美国——我要非常清楚地表明这一点！”我告诉他们。“我来这里是要说真话——如果真相谴责美国，那么她就该受到谴责！”
One evening I met most of the officials in Ghana-all of those with whom I had previously talked,and more-at a party that was given for me by the Honorable Kofi Baako, the Ghanaian Minister ofDefense, and the Leader of the National Assembly. I was told that this was the first time such anhonor was accorded to a foreigner since Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois had come to Ghana. There wasmusic, dancing, and fine Ghanaian food. Several persons at the party were laughing amongthemselves, saying that at an earlier party that day, U.S. Ambassador Mahomey was knockinghimself out being exceptionally friendly and jovial. Some thought that he was making a strongeffort to counteract the truth about America that I was telling every chance I got. 
 一天晚上，我在加纳国防部长兼国民大会领袖Kofi Baako阁下为我举办的派对上见到了加纳的大多数官员——所有我之前与之交谈过的人，以及更多的人。我被告知，这是自W.E.B. Du Bois博士来到加纳以来第一次给予外国人如此荣誉。派对上有音乐、舞蹈和美味的加纳食物。派对上的几个人在互相笑着，说当天早些时候的派对上，美国大使Mahomey竭尽全力表现得格外友好和愉快。有些人认为他正在努力抵消我每次有机会都会讲述的关于美国的真相。 
 Then an invitation came to me which exceeded my wildest dream. I would never have imaginedthat I would actually have an opportunity to address the members of the Ghanaian Parliament! 
 接着，我收到了一份超出我梦想的邀请。我从未想过我竟然有机会向加纳议会成员发表演讲！ 
I made my remarks brief-but I made them strong: "How can you condemn Portugal and SouthAfrica while our black people in America are being bitten by dogs and beaten with clubs?" I said Ifelt certain that the only reason black Africans-our black brothers-could be so silent about whathappened in America was that they had been misinformed by the American government'spropaganda agencies. 
 我的发言简短而有力：“你们怎么能谴责葡萄牙和南非，而我们美国的黑人却遭受着狗咬和棍棒的殴打？”我说。我确信，非洲黑人——我们的黑人兄弟——对美国所发生的事情保持沉默的唯一原因是他们被美国政府的宣传机构误导了。 
At the end of my talk, I heard "Yes! We support the Afro-American . . . morally, physically,materially if necessary!" 
 在我的演讲结束时，我听到了“是的！我们支持非裔美国人……在道德上、物质上、必要的情况下在身体上！” 
In Ghana-or in all of black Africa-my highest single honor was an audience at the Castle withOsagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkru-mah. 
 在加纳——或者在整个非洲黑人地区——我最高的荣誉是与加纳总统克鲁玛博士一起在城堡里聆听他的演讲。 
Before seeing him, I was searched most thoroughly. I respected the type of security theGhanaians erect around their leader. It gave me that much more respect for independent blackmen. Then, as I entered Dr. Nkramah's long office, he came out from behind his desk at the farend. Dr. Nkrumah wore ordinary dress, his hand was extended and a smile was on his sensitiveface. I pumped his hand. We sat on a couch and talked. I knew that he was particularly well- informed on the Afro-American's plight, as for years he had lived and studied in America. Wediscussed the unity of Africans and peoples of African descent. We agreed that Pan-Africanismwas the key also to the problems of those of African heritage. I could feel the warm, likeable andvery down-to-earth qualities of Dr. Nkrumah. My time with him was up all too soon. I promisedfaithfully that when I returned to the United States, I would relay to Afro-Americans his personalwarm regards. 
 在见到他之前，我被彻底搜查了一遍。我尊重加纳人在他们领袖周围建立的安全类型。这让我更加尊重独立的黑人。然后，当我走进克鲁玛博士的长办公室时，他从桌子后面走了出来。克鲁玛博士穿着普通的衣服，他的手伸出来，脸上带着微笑。我和他握了握手。我们坐在沙发上聊天。我知道他对非裔美国人的困境特别了解，因为他多年来一直生活和学习在美国。我们讨论了非洲人和非洲裔人民的团结问题。我们一致认为泛非主义也是解决非洲裔人民问题的关键。我可以感受到克鲁玛博士温暖、可爱和非常务实的品质。我与他相处的时间过得太快了。我真诚地承诺，当我回到美国时，我会向非裔美国人转达他的亲切问候。 
 That afternoon, thirty-nine miles away in Winneba, I spoke at the Kwame Nkrumah IdeologicalInstitute-where two hundred students were being trained to carry forward Ghana's intellectualrevolution, and here again occurred one of those astounding demonstrations of the youngAfrican's political fervor. After I had spoken, during the question-and-answer period, some youngAfro-American stood up, whom none there seemed to know. "I am an American Negro," heannounced himself. Vaguely, he defended the American white man. The African students booedand harassed him. Then instantly when the meeting was over, they cornered this fellow withverbal abuse, "Are you an agent of Rockefeller?" . . ."Stop corrupting our children!" (The fellowhad turned out to be a local secondary school teacher, placed in the job by an American agency.).. ."Come to this Institute for some orientation!" Temporarily, a teacher rescued the fellow-but thenthe students rushed him and drove him away, shouting, "Stooge!" . . ."C.I.A." . . ."Americanagent!" 
那天下午，在39英里外的温内巴，我在夸梅·恩克鲁玛思想学院（Kwame Nkrumah IdeologicalInstitute）发表演讲，那里有200名学生正在接受培训，以推进加纳的知识革命，这里再次发生了一次令人震惊的非洲青年政治热情的展示。在我发言之后，在问答阶段，一些年轻的美国人站了起来，他们似乎都不认识。“我是一个美国黑人，”他自己宣布。他含糊地为美国白人辩护。非洲学生对他发出嘘声并进行骚扰。会议一结束，他们就把这个家伙逼上了绝路，骂道：“你是洛克菲勒的代理人吗？”.“别再腐蚀我们的孩子了！”（这个家伙原来是当地的一名中学教师，由一家美国机构安排的）.“来这个学院熟悉情况！”一名教师暂时救了这个家伙，但随后学生们冲过去把他赶走了。大喊：“活宝！”……“中情局”……“美国特工！”
Chinese Ambassador and Mrs. Huang Hua gave a state dinner in my honor. The guests includedthe Cuban and the Algerian ambassadors, and also it was here that I met Mrs. W. E. B. Du Bois.After the excellent dinner, three films were shown. One, a color film, depicted the People'sRepublic of China in celebration of its Fourteenth Anniversary. Prominently shown in this film wasthe militant former North Carolina Afro-American Robert Williams, who has since taken refuge inCuba after his advocacy that the American black people should take up arms to defend andprotect themselves. The second film focused upon the Chinese people's support for the Afro- American struggle. Chairman Mao Tse-tung was shown delivering his statement of that support,and the film offered sickening moments of graphic white brutality-police and civilian-to Afro- Americans who were demonstrating in various U.S. cities, seeking civil rights. And the final filmwas a dramatic presentation of the Algerian Revolution. 
中国大使和黄华夫人为我举行了国宴。客人包括古巴和阿尔及利亚大使，也正是在这里，我遇到了W.E.B.杜波依斯夫人。其中一部是彩色电影，描绘了中华人民共和国庆祝成立十四周年的情景。这部电影中突出表现的是激进的前北卡罗来纳州非裔美国人罗伯特·威廉姆斯，他在倡导美国黑人应该拿起武器保卫和保护自己后，后来在古巴避难。第二部电影的重点是中国人民对非裔美国人斗争的支持。毛泽东主席发表了他支持的声明，这部电影向在美国各个城市示威寻求民权的非裔美国人提供了令人作呕的白人暴行——警察和平民。最后一部电影是阿尔及利亚革命的戏剧性呈现。
The "Malcolm X Committee" rushed me from the Chinese Embassy dinner towhere a soiree in myhonor had already begun at the Press Club. It was my first sight of Ghanaians dancing the high- life. A high and merry time was being had by everyone, and I was pressed to make a shortspeech. I stressed again the need for unity between Africans and Afro-Americans. I cried out ofmy heart, "Now, dance! Sing! But as you do-remember 
“马尔科姆·X委员会”把我从中国大使馆的晚宴上赶到记者俱乐部，为我举行的晚会已经开始了。这是我第一次看到加纳人在上流社会跳舞。每个人都度过了一段快乐的时光，我被迫做了一个简短的演讲。我再次强调了非洲人和非裔美国人之间团结的必要性。我从心底里喊道，现在，跳舞吧！唱吧！但正如你所记得的
Mandela, remember Sobokwe! Remember Lumumba in his grave! Remember South Africansnow in jail!" 
"曼德拉，记住索博奎！记住坟墓里的卢蒙巴！记住南非在监狱里的雪！ 
I said, "You wonder why _I_ don't dance? Because I want you to remember twenty-two millionAfro-Americans in the U.S.!" 
 我说道：“你们想知道我为什么不跳舞吗？因为我希望你们能记住美国2200万非裔美国人！” 
But I sure felt like dancing! The Ghanaians performed the high-life as if possessed. One prettyAfrican girl sang "Blue Moon" like Sarah Vaughan. Sometimes the band sounded like MiltJackson, sometimes like Charlie Parker. 
 但我确实想跳舞！加纳人跳着高-life舞，仿佛被附身了一样。一个漂亮的非洲女孩唱着《蓝月亮》，就像Sarah Vaughan一样。有时候乐队听起来像Milt Jackson，有时候又像Charlie Parker。 
The next morning, a Saturday, I heard that Cassius Clay and his entourage had arrived. Therewas a huge reception for him at the airport. I thought that if Cassius and I happened to meet, itwould likely prove embarrassing for Cassius, since he had elected to remain with ElijahMuhammad's version of Islam. I would not have been embarrassed, but I knew that Cassiuswould have been forbidden to associate with me. I knew that Cassius knew I had been with him,and for him, and believed in him, when those who later embraced him felt that he had no chance.I decided to avoid Cassius so as not to put him on the spot. 
 第二天早上，一个星期六，我听说卡修斯·克莱和他的随行人员已经到了。在机场有一个盛大的欢迎仪式。我想如果卡修斯和我碰巧见面，那可能会让卡修斯感到尴尬，因为他已经选择留在伊利亚·穆罕默德版本的伊斯兰教中。我不会感到尴尬，但我知道卡修斯会被禁止与我交往。我知道卡修斯知道我曾与他在一起，为他而战，并相信他，尽管后来拥抱他的人认为他没有机会。我决定避开卡修斯，以免让他陷入困境。 
A luncheon was given for me that afternoon by the Nigerian High Commissioner, His ExcellencyAlhadji Isa Wall, a short, bespectacled, extremely warm and friendly man who had lived inWashington, D.C. for two years. After lunch, His Excellency spoke to the guests of his Americanencounters with discrimination, and of friendships he had made with Afro-Americans, and hereaffirmed the bonds between Africans and Afro-Americans.His Excellency held up before the luncheon guests a large and handsome issue of an Americanmagazine, _Horizon_; it was opened to an article about the Nation of Islam, written by Dr. MorroeBerger of Princeton University. One full page was a photograph of me; the opposite full page wasa beautiful color illustration of a black royal Nigerian Muslim, stalwart and handsome, of hundredsof years ago. 
那天下午，尼日利亚驻美国大使阁下阿尔哈吉·伊萨·沃勒先生为我举行了一场午餐会。他是一位身材矮小、戴着眼镜、非常热情友好的人，曾在华盛顿特区生活过两年。午饭后，阁下向客人讲述了他在与美国人交往中所遇到的歧视以及他与非裔美国人建立的友谊，并在此强调非洲人和非裔美国人之间的纽带关系。阁下在午餐会上向客人们展示了一本美国杂志《地平线》的精美封面；打开它，里面有一篇关于伊斯兰国家的报道，作者是普林斯顿大学的莫罗·伯格博士。一整页都是我的肖像照片；另一整页则是一幅美丽的彩色插图，描绘了数百年前一位黑人皇家尼日利亚穆斯林勇士的形象，英俊而坚定。
"When I look at these photographs, I know these two people are one," said His Excellency. "Theonly difference is in their attire-and one was born in America and the other in Africa. 
"当我看着这些照片时，我知道这两个人是一体的，"阁下说。"唯一的区别是他们的衣着——一个出生在美国，另一个出生在非洲。
"So to let everyone know that I believe we are brothers, I am going to give to Alhadji Malcolm X arobe like that worn by the Nigerian in this photo." 
"所以为了让大家知道，我相信我们是兄弟，我打算给马哈吉·马尔科姆·X一件像这位尼日利亚人穿的长袍。"
I was overwhelmed by the splendor of the beautiful blue robe and the orange turban which HisExcellency then presented to me. I bent over so that he, a short man, could properly arrange theturban on my head. His Excellency Alhadji Isa Wali also presented me with a two-volumetranslation of the Holy Quran. After this unforgettable luncheon, Mrs. Shirley Graham Du Boisdrove me to her home, so that I could see and photograph the home where her famed latehusband, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, had spent his last days. Mrs. Du Bois, a writer, was the Director ofGhanaian television, which was planned for educational purposes. When Dr. Du Bois had cometo Ghana, she told me, Dr. Nkrumah had set up the aging great militant Afro-American scholarlike a king, giving to Dr. Du Bois everything he could wish for. Mrs. Du Bois told me that when Dr.Du Bois was failing fast, Dr. Nkrumah had visited, and the two men had said good-bye, bothknowing that one's death was near-and Dr. Nkrumah had gone away in tears. 
 我被那件美丽的蓝色长袍和橙色头巾的华丽所震撼，这是阁下随后送给我的。我弯下腰，这样他这个矮个子男人就可以把我头上的头巾整理好。阁下还向我赠送了两卷《古兰经》的翻译本。在这次难忘的午餐会之后，雪莉·格雷厄姆·杜布瓦夫人开车送我到她的家，让我看看并拍摄她已故丈夫、著名学者W.E.B.杜布瓦博士度过最后时光的家。杜布瓦夫人是一位作家，也是加纳电视台的主任，该电视台是为教育目的而设立的。当杜布瓦博士来到加纳时，她告诉我，恩克鲁玛博士把这位年迈的非裔美国战士学者像国王一样对待，给了他所有他想要的东西。杜布瓦夫人告诉我，当杜布瓦博士病情迅速恶化时，恩克鲁玛博士曾来探望过他，两人告别时都知道对方的生命即将结束——恩克鲁玛博士含泪离去。 
My final Ghanaian social event was a beautiful party in my honor given by HisExcellency Mr.Armando Entralgo Gonzalez, the Cuban Ambassador to Ghana. The next morning-it was Sunday- the "Malcolm X Committee" was waiting at my hotel, to accompany me to the airport. As we leftthe hotel, we met Cassius Clay with some of his entourage, returning from his morning walk.Cassius momentarily seemed uncertain-then he spoke, something almost monosyllabic, like"How are you?" It flashed through my mind how close we had been before the fight that hadchanged the course of his life. I replied that I was fine-something like that-and that I hoped hewas, which I sincerely meant. Later on, I sent Cassius a message by wire, saying that I hopedthat he would realize how much he was loved by Muslims wherever they were; and that he wouldnot let anyone use him and maneuver him into saying and doing things to tarnish his image. 
 我参加的最后一个加纳社交活动是由加纳驻古巴大使阿曼多·恩特拉戈·冈萨雷斯先生阁下为我举办的一场盛大的宴会。第二天早上——那天是星期天——“马尔科姆·X委员会”在酒店等我，陪我去机场。当我们离开酒店时，我们遇到了卡修斯·克莱和他的一些随行人员，他们刚从晨练回来。卡修斯一时似乎有些不确定——然后他说了几句话，几乎都是单音节的，比如“你好吗？”我突然想到我们在改变他人生轨迹的那场战斗之前是多么亲密。我回答说我很好——差不多是这样——我希望他也没事，我是真心实意的。后来，我给卡修斯发了一封电报，说我 
The "Malcolm X Committee" and I were exchanging goodbyes at the Accra airport when a smallmotorcade of _five Ambassadors_ arrived-to see me off! I no longer had any words. 
 当“马尔科姆·X委员会”和我在阿克拉机场互相告别时，一支由五名大使组成的小型车队抵达——为我送行！我再也说不出话来了。 
In the plane, bound for Monrovia, Liberia, to spend a day, I knew that after what I hadexperienced in the Holy Land, the second most indelible memory I would carry back to Americawould be the Africa seething with serious awareness of itself, and of Africa's wealth, and of herpower, and of her destined role in the world. 
在飞往利比里亚蒙罗维亚的飞机上，我知道自己经历了圣地之旅后，带回在飞往利比里亚蒙罗维亚的飞机上，我知道自己经历了圣地之旅后，带回美国的第二个最难以磨灭的记忆将是非洲对自己、对非洲的财富、对她的力量和她在世界注定要扮演的角色的强烈意识。 
From Monrovia, I flew to Dakar, Senegal. The Senegalese in the airport, hearing about theMuslim from America, stood in line to shake my hand, and I signed many autographs. "Ourpeople can't speak Arabic, but we have Islam in our hearts," said one Senegalese. I told themthat exactly described their fellow Afro-American Muslims. 
从蒙罗维亚，我飞往塞内加尔达喀尔。在机场的塞内加尔人听说了来自美国的穆斯林，排队与我握手，我签了很多名。“我们的人不会说阿拉伯语，但我们心中有伊斯兰教，”一位塞内加尔人说。我告诉他们，这恰好描述了他们的非裔美国穆斯林同胞。 
From Dakar, I flew to Morocco, where I spent a day sightseeing. I visited the famous Casbah, theghetto which had resulted when the ruling white Frenchwouldn't let the dark-skinned natives intocertain areas of Casablanca. Thousands upon thousands of the subjugated natives werecrowded into the ghetto, in the same way that Harlem, in New York City, became America'sCasbah. 
从达喀尔，我飞往摩洛哥，在那里度过了一天的观光。我参观了著名的卡斯巴，这是一个贫民窟，当统治着法国白人不允许深色皮肤的当地人进入卡萨布兰卡的某些地区时形成的。成千上万被征服的当地人被挤进贫民窟，就像纽约市的哈莱姆区成为美国的卡斯巴一样。 
It was Tuesday, May 19, 1964-my thirty-ninth birthday-when I arrived in Algiers. A lot of water hadgone under the bridge in those years. In some ways, I had had more experiences than a dozenmen. The taxi driver, while taking me to the Hotel Aletti, described the atrocities the French hadcommitted, and personal measures that he had taken to get even. I walked around Algiers,hearing rank-and-file expressions of hatred for America for supporting the oppressors of theAlgerians. They were true revolutionists, not afraid of death. They had, for so long, faced death. 
那是1964年5月19日，星期二——我39岁生日——当我到达阿尔及尔时。这些年里发生了很多事情。在某些方面，我比十几个人有更多的经历。出租车司机在送我去阿莱蒂酒店的路上，描述了法国人所犯下的暴行，以及他个人采取的措施来报复。我在阿尔及尔四处走动，听到普通民众对美国支持阿尔及利亚压迫者的仇恨表达。他们是真正的革命者，不怕死亡。他们已经面对死亡很长时间了。

The Pan American jet which took me home-it was Flight 115-landed at New York's Kennedy AirTerminal on May 2 1, at 4:25 in the afternoon. We passengers filed off the plane and towardCustoms. When I saw the crowd of fifty or sixty reporters and photographers, I honestly wonderedwhat celebrity I had been on the plane with. 
把我送回家的泛美航空公司115次航班于5月21日下午4点25分降落在纽约肯尼迪机场。乘客们下了飞机，向海关走去。当我看到五六十个记者和摄影师时，我确实想知道我在飞机上与哪位名人在一起。
But I was the "villain" they had come to meet. 
但我却是他们要见的"坏人"。
In Harlem especially, and also in some other U.S. cities, the 1964 long, hot summer's predictedexplosions had begun. Article after article in the white man's press had cast me as a symbol-if nota causative agent-of the "revolt" and of the "violence" of the American black man, wherever it hadsprung up. 
尤其是在哈莱姆，还有美国其他一些城市，1964年漫长而炎热的夏天所预言的爆发已经开始。白人媒体上的文章一篇接一篇地把我描绘成一个象征——如果不是一个起因——无论在哪里，都是美国黑人"反抗"和"暴力"的象征。
In the biggest press conference that I had ever experienced anywhere, the camera bulbs flashed,and the reporters fired questions. 
在我曾经经历过的最大的新闻发布会上，相机闪光灯闪烁着，记者们提出了问题。
 "Mr. Malcolm X, what about those 'Blood Brothers,' reportedly affiliated with your organization,reportedly trained for violence, who have killed innocent white people?" . . ."Mr. Malcolm X, whatabout your comment that Negroes should form rifle clubs? . . ." 
"马尔科姆先生，那些据报道与您的组织有关联、据说接受过暴力训练、杀害无辜白人的'血盟兄弟'是怎么回事？" .."马尔科姆先生，您说黑人应该组建步枪俱乐部，这是怎么回事？"
I answered the questions. I knew I was back in America again, hearing the subjective, scapegoat- seeking questions of the white man. New York white youth were killing victims; that was a"sociological" problem. But when black youth killed somebody, the power structure was looking tohang somebody. When black men had been lynched or otherwise murdered in cold blood, it wasalways said, "Things will get better. "When whites had rifles in their homes, the Constitution gavethem the right to protect their home and themselves. But when black people even spoke of havingrifles in their homes, that was "ominous." 
我回答了这些问题。我知道我又回到了美国，听到了白人的主观、寻找替罪羊的问题。纽约的白人青年杀害受害者，这是一个“社会学”问题。但是当黑人青年杀了人时，权力结构就会找人绞死。当黑人被私刑处死或其他方式被残忍杀害时，总是说“事情会好起来的”。当白人家里有步枪时，宪法赋予他们保护自己和家人的权利。但是当黑人甚至谈论在家里有步枪时，这是“不祥之兆”。
I slipped in on the reporters something they hadn't been expecting. I said that the American blackman needed to quit thinking what the white man had taught him-which was that the black manhad no alternative except to beg for his so-called "civil rights." I said that the American black manneeded to recognize that he had a strong, airtight case to take the United States before theUnited Nations on a formal accusation of "denial of human rights"-and that if Angola and SouthAfrica were precedent cases, then there would be no easy way that the U.S. could escape beingcensured, right on its own home ground. 
我向记者们透露了一些他们没有预料到的事情。我说，美国黑人需要停止思考白人教给他们的东西——那就是黑人除了乞求所谓的“民权”之外别无选择。我说，美国黑人需要认识到，他有一个强有力的、无可辩驳的理由，可以向联合国正式指控美国“侵犯人权”——如果安哥拉和南非是先例的话，那么美国将无法轻易逃脱在其本土上受到谴责的命运。
Just as I had known, the press wanted to get me off that subject. I was asked about my "LetterFrom Mecca"-I was all set with a speech regarding that: 
正如我所料，媒体想让我离开这个话题。他们问我关于我的“来自麦加的信”——我已经准备好了一个关于这个主题的演讲：
"I hope that once and for all my Hajj to the Holy City of Mecca has established our MuslimMosque's authentic religious affiliation with the 750 million Muslims of the orthodox Islamic World.And I _know_ once and for all that the Black Africans look upon America's 22 million blacks aslong-lost _brothers_!They _love_ us ! They _study_ our struggle for freedom! They were so_happy_ to hear how we are awakening from our long sleep-after so-called 'Christian' whiteAmerica had taught us to be _ashamed_ of our African brothers and homeland! 
我希望我的麦加朝觐能够一劳永逸地确立我们穆斯林清真寺与正统伊斯兰世界7.5亿穆斯林的真正宗教联系。而且我也知道，非洲黑人将美国的2200万黑人视为失散多年的兄弟！他们爱我们！他们研究我们为自由而斗争！他们听到我们正在从漫长的沉睡中觉醒，感到非常高兴——在所谓的基督教白人美国教会我们为我们非洲的兄弟姐妹和家园感到羞耻之后！
"Yes-I wrote a letter from Mecca. You're asking me 'Didn't you say that now you accept white menas brothers?' Well, my answer is that in the Muslim World, I saw, I felt, and I wrote home how mythinking was broadened! Just as I wrote, I shared true, brotherly love with many white- complexioned Muslims who never gave a single thought to the race, or to the complexion, ofanother Muslim. 
是的，我写了一封来自麦加的信。你问我“难道你不是说现在你接受白人作为兄弟吗？”那么，我的答案是，在穆斯林世界里，我看到、感受到并写信回家说我的思想得到了开阔！正如我所写，我和许多白皙肤色的穆斯林分享了真正的兄弟之爱，他们从未考虑过另一个穆斯林的种族或肤色。
"My pilgrimage broadened my scope. It blessed me with a new insight. In two weeks in the HolyLand, I saw what I never had seen in thirty-nine years here in America. I saw all _races_, all_colors_,-blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans-in _true_ brotherhood! In unity! Living asone! Worshiping as one! No segregationists-no liberals; they would not have known how tointerpret the meaning of those words. 
我的朝觐之旅开阔了我的视野。它赐予我新的洞察力。在圣地的两周里，我看到了在美国39年从未见过的东西。我看到了所有种族、所有肤色的人——蓝眼睛的金发人到黑皮肤的非洲人——真正地兄弟情谊！团结一致！生活在一起！一起崇拜！没有种族隔离主义者——没有自由主义者；他们不会理解这些词语的意义。
"In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments of all white people. I never will be guilty ofthat again-as I know now that some white people are truly sincere, that some truly are capable ofbeing brotherly toward a black man. The true Islam has shown me that a blanket indictment of allwhite people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments against blacks. 
过去，是的，我曾经对所有白人进行了一概而论的指控。我不会再犯同样的错误——因为我现在知道有些白人是真诚的，有些人真的能够对黑人表现出兄弟之情。真正的伊斯兰教向我展示了，对所有白人进行一概而论的指控是错误的，就像白人对黑人进行一概而论的指控一样。
"Yes, I have been convinced that _some_ American whites do want to help cure the rampantracism which is on the path to _destroying_ this country! 
是的，我相信有些美国白人确实想要帮助治愈猖獗的种族主义，这种种族主义正在摧毁这个国家！
"It was in the Holy World that my attitude was changed, by what I experienced there, and by whatI witnessed there, in terms of brotherhood-not just brotherhood toward me, but brotherhoodbetween all men, of all nationalitiesand complexions, who were there. And now that I am back inAmerica, my attitude here concerning white people has to be governed by what my black brothersand I experience here, and what we witness here-in terms of brotherhood. The _problem_ here inAmerica is that we meet such a small minority of individual so-called 'good,' or 'brotherly' whitepeople. Here in the United States, notwithstanding those few 'good' white people, it is the_collective_ 150 million white people whom the _collective_ 22 million black people have to dealwith! 
正是在圣地，我的态度发生了变化，因为我在那里的经历和我目睹的兄弟情谊——不仅仅是对我表现出的兄弟情谊，而是所有在那里的人之间的兄弟情谊，无论国籍和肤色如何。现在我已经回到了美国，我在这里对白人的态度必须受到我和我的黑人兄弟们在这里所经历和目睹的事情的影响——以兄弟情谊为准则。在美国这里的问题是，我们只遇到了极少数所谓的“好”或“兄弟般”的白人个体。尽管有这些少数“好”白人，但2200万黑人必须面对的是1.5亿白人集体！
"Why, here in America, the seeds of racism are so deeply rooted in the white people collectively,their belief that they are 'superior' in some way is so deeply rooted, that these things are in thenational white subconsciousness. Many whites are even actually unaware of their own racism,until they face some test, and then their racism emerges in one form or another. 
为什么在美国，种族主义的种子如此深深地根植于白人集体中，他们认为自己在某些方面“优越”的信念是如此根深蒂固，以至于这些东西都存在于国家白人的潜意识中。许多白人甚至实际上没有意识到自己的种族主义，直到他们面临某种考验，然后他们的种族主义以这种或那种形式出现。
"Listen! The white man's racism toward the black man here in America is what has got him insuch trouble all over this world, with other non-white peoples. The white man can't separatehimself from the stigma that he automatically feels about anyone, no matter who, who is not hiscolor. And the non-white peoples of the world are sick of the condescending white man! That'swhy you've got all of this trouble in places like Viet Nam. Or right here in the WesternHemisphere-probably 100 million people of African descent are divided against each other, taughtby the white man to hate and to mistrust each other. In the West Indies, Cuba, Brazil, Venezuela,all of South America, Central America! All of those lands are full of people with African blood! Onthe African continent, even, the white man has maneuvered to divide the black African from thebrown Arab, to divide the so-called 'Christian African' from the Muslim African. Can you imaginewhat can happen, what would certainly happen, if all of these African-heritage peoples ever_realize_ their blood bonds, if they ever realize they all have a common goal-if they ever_unite_?" 
听着！白人在美国对黑人的种族主义是他在这个世界上与其他国家的其他非白人民族陷入如此麻烦的原因。白人无法将自己与他对任何不是他肤色的人自动产生的污名分开。世界上的非白人民族已经厌倦了傲慢自大的白人！这就是为什么你在像越南这样的地方遇到所有这些麻烦的原因。或者就在西半球——可能有1亿非洲裔人被白人分裂，教导他们相互仇恨和不信任。在西印度群岛、古巴、巴西、委内瑞拉、整个南美洲、中美洲！所有这些地方都充满了有非洲血统的人！甚至在非洲大陆上，白人也一直试图将非洲黑人与棕色阿拉伯人分开，将所谓的“基督教非洲人”与穆斯林非洲人分开。你能想象会发生什么吗？如果所有这些具有非洲血统的民族都能意识到他们的血缘关系，如果他们意识到他们都有一个共同的目标——如果他们团结起来会发生什么呢？
 The press was glad to get rid of me that day. I believe that the black brothers whom I had justrecently left in Africa would have felt that I did the subject justice. Nearly through the night, mytelephone at home kept ringing. My black brothers and sisters around New York and in someother cities were calling to congratulate me on what they had heard on the radio and televisionnews broadcasts, and people, mostly white, were wanting to know if I would speak here or there. 
那天，媒体很高兴摆脱了我。我相信我刚刚离开非洲的黑人兄弟们会认为我对这个话题公正对待了。几乎整夜，我家的电话一直响个不停。我在纽约和一些其他城市的黑人兄弟姐妹们打电话来祝贺我在广播和电视新闻广播中听到的内容，而且大多数人是白人，想知道我是否会在这里或那里发言。
The next day I was in my car driving along the freeway when at a red light another car pulledalongside. A white woman was driving and on the passenger's side, next to me, was a white man."_Malcolm X_!" he called out-and when I looked, he stuck his hand out of his car, across at me,grinning. "Do you mind shaking hands with a white man?" Imagine that! Just as the traffic lightturned green, I told him, "I don't mind shaking hands with human beings. Are you one?" 
第二天，我开车沿着高速公路行驶，在红灯处停下时，另一辆车靠了过来。一位白人女性驾驶着车，而在乘客侧，靠近我的位置上坐着一位白人男性。“马尔科姆·X！”他喊道——当我看他时，他从车里伸出手来，向我咧嘴一笑。“你介意和一个白人握手吗？”想象一下！就在交通灯变绿的时候，我告诉他：“我不介意和人类握手。你是人吗？”
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
第十九章
1965 
1965年
I must be honest. Negroes-Afro-Americans-showed no inclination to rush to the United Nationsand demand justice for themselves here in America. I really had known in advance that theywouldn't. The American white man has so thoroughly brainwashed the black man to see himselfas only a domestic "civil rights" problem that it will probably take longer than I live before theNegro sees that the struggle of the American black man is international. 
我必须说老实话。黑人——非洲裔美国人——没有表现出急于跑到联合国来为他们自己在美国寻求公正的倾向。我确实预先就知道他们不会这样做。美国白人已经彻底地给黑人洗脑，使他们把自己看作仅仅是国内的“民权”问题，因此，黑人要认识到美国黑人的斗争是国际性的，可能要花比我预期的更长的时间。
And I had known, too, that Negroes would not rush to follow me into the orthodox Islam whichhad given me the insight and perspective to see that the black men and white men truly could bebrothers. America's Negroes-especially older Negroes-are too indelibly soaked in Christianity'sdouble standard of oppression. 
我也知道,黑人不会急于跟随我进入正统的伊斯兰教,它使我有了洞察力和观点,使我看到黑人和白人真的可以成为兄弟。美国的黑人——尤其是年长的黑人——已经被基督教的双重标准深深浸透。
So, in the "public invited" meetings which I began holding each Sunday afternoon or evening inHarlem's well-known Audubon Ballroom, as I addressed predominantly non-Muslim Negroaudiences, I did not immediately attempt to press the Islamic religion, but instead to embrace allwho sat before me: 
所以，在我开始每个星期天下午或晚上在哈莱姆著名的奥杜邦舞厅举行的“公开邀请”的会议上，当我面对主要不是穆斯林的黑人听众时，我没有立即试图宣传伊斯兰教，而是拥抱了在我面前的所有人。
"-not Muslim, nor Christian, Catholic, nor Protestant . . . Baptist nor Methodist, Democrat norRepublican, Mason nor Elk! I mean the black people of America-and the black people all over thisearth! Because it is as this collective mass of black people that we have been deprived not only ofour civil rights, but even of our human rights, the right to human dignity. . . ." 
"既不是穆斯林，也不是基督教徒，天主教徒，新教徒……浸信会教徒，卫理公会教徒，民主党人，共和党人，共济会会员，野牛会会员！我是说美国的黑人——以及全世界的黑人！因为正是作为这个黑人的集体群体，我们不仅被剥夺了公民权利，甚至被剥夺了人权，即人的尊严的权利……"
On the streets, after my speeches, in the faces and the voices of the people I met-even thosewho would pump my hands and want my autograph-I would feel the wait-and-see attitude. I wouldfeel-and I understood-their uncertainty about where I stood. Since the Civil War's "freedom," theblack man has gone down so many fruitless paths. His leaders, very largely, had failed him. Thereligion of Christianity had failed him. The black man was scarred, he was cautious, he wasapprehensive. 
在街头，在我演讲之后，在我遇到的人们的脸上和声音里——即使那些会握紧我的手并想要我的签名的人——我都能感觉到一种观望的态度。我能感觉到——我能理解——他们对我立场的不确定。自从内战的“自由”以来，黑人已经走过了许多无果的道路。他的领导人，很大程度上，已经辜负了他。基督教的宗教已经辜负了他。黑人受伤了，他谨慎了，他害怕了。
I understood it better now than I had before. In the Holy World, away from America's raceproblem, was the first time I ever had been able to think clearly about the basic divisions of whitepeople in America, and how their attitudes and their motives related to, and affected Negroes. Inmy thirty-nine years on this earth, the Holy City of Mecca had been the first time I had ever stoodbefore the Creator of All and felt like a complete human being. 
我现在比以前更明白了。在圣城麦加，远离美国的种族问题，这是我第一次能够清楚地思考美国白人基本的划分，以及他们的态度和动机如何与黑人相关，如何影响黑人。在我在这个世界上生活的三十九年中，麦加的圣城是我第一次站在造物主面前，感觉自己是一个完整的人。
In that peace of the Holy World-in fact, the very night I have mentioned when I lay awakesurrounded by snoring brother pilgrims-my mind took me back topersonal memories I would havethought were gone forever . . . as far back, even, as when I was just a little boy, eight or nineyears old. Out behind our house, out in the country from Lansing, Michigan, there was an old,grassy "Hector's Hill," we called it-which may still be there. I remembered there in the Holy Worldhow I used to lie on the top of Hector's Hill, and look up at the sky, at the clouds moving over me,and daydream, all kinds of things. And then, in a funny contrast of recollections, I rememberedhow years later, when I was in prison, I used to lie on my cell bunk-this would be especially whenI was in solitary: what we convicts called "The Hole"-and I would picture myself talking to largecrowds. I don't have any idea why such previsions came to me. But they did. To tell that toanyone then would have sounded crazy. Even I didn't have, myself, the slightest inkling. . . . 
在那神圣世界的和平中——事实上，我提到的那个我醒着躺在打鼾的兄弟朝圣者中间的夜晚——我的思绪回到了我本以为永远消失的个人记忆中……甚至可以追溯到我八九岁的时候，那时我还是个小男孩。在我们家的后面，远离密歇根州兰辛市的乡村，有一个我们称之为“赫克托山”的老草地——可能现在还在那里。我记得在那神圣的世界里，我常常躺在赫克托山的顶部，抬头看着天空，看着飘过我的云彩，做着各种各样的白日梦。然后，以一种有趣的回忆对比，我记得多年后，当我在监狱时，我常常躺在我的牢房床上——这尤其是在我被单独监禁的时候：我们囚犯称之为“洞穴”——我会想象自己在对一大群人讲话。我不知道为什么这样的预见会出现在我脑海中。但它们确实出现了。那时把这些告诉任何人听起来都会很疯狂。甚至我自己也没有一丝一毫的预感……
In Mecca, too, I had played back for myself the twelve years I had spent with Elijah Muhammadas if it were a motion picture. I guess it would be impossible for anyone ever to realize fully howcomplete was my belief in Elijah Muhammad. I believed in him not only as a leader in the ordinary_human_ sense, but also I believed in him as a _divine_ leader. I believed he had no humanweaknesses or faults, and that, therefore, he could make no mistakes and that he could do nowrong. There on a Holy World hilltop, I realized how very dangerous it is for people to hold anyhuman being in such esteem, especially to consider anyone some sort of "divinely guided" and"protected" person. 
在麦加，我也曾像看一部电影一样，把自己和伊莱贾·穆罕默德一起度过的十二年重新回味了一遍。我想，任何人恐怕都无法完全理解我对伊莱贾·穆罕默德的信仰有多么坚定。我不仅把他当作一个普通的领导人来信仰，而且把他当作一个神圣的领导人来信仰。我相信他没有任何人性的弱点或缺点，因此他不会犯错误，他不会做错任何事。在圣山的山顶上，我意识到，人们对任何人的过分尊敬是多么危险，尤其是把某个人当作“受到神灵指引和保护”的人。
My thinking had been opened up wide in Mecca. In the long letters I wrote to friends, I tried toconvey to them my new insights into the American black man's struggle and his problems, as wellas the depths of my search for truth and justice. 
我在麦加时思想大开。我在给朋友们写的长信中，试图向他们转述我对美国黑人的斗争和问题的新认识，以及我对真理和正义的探索的深度。
"I've had enough of someone else's propaganda," I had written to these friends. "I'm for truth, nomatter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I'm a human being first andforemost, and as such I'm for whoever andwhatever benefits humanity _as a whole_." 
我已经受够了别人的宣传，我给这些朋友写道。我追求真理，不论是谁在传播。我追求公正，不论它是为谁或反对谁。我首先是一个人，因此我支持对全人类有益的任何人和事。
Largely, the American white man's press refused to convey that I was now attempting to teachNegroes a new direction. With the 1964 "long, hot summer" steadily producing new incidents, Iwas constantly accused of "stirring up Negroes." Every time I had another radio or televisionmicrophone at my mouth, when I was asked about "stirring up Negroes" or "inciting violence," I'dget hot. 
美国白人新闻界大体上拒绝传达我正在试图教给黑人新的方向这一事实。1964年“漫长而炎热的夏天”不断产生新的事件，我不断被指责为“煽动黑人”。每次我拿着另一台无线电或电视麦克风，当我被问及“煽动黑人”或“煽动暴力”时，我都会生气。
"It takes no one to stir up the sociological dynamite that stems from the unemployment, badhousing, and inferior education already in the ghettoes. This explosively criminal condition hasexisted for so long, it needs no fuse; it fuses itself; it spontaneously combusts from within itself. . .." 
没有人需要去煽动失业、住房糟糕和教育低劣等社会问题给贫民区带来的动荡。这种爆炸性的犯罪状况已经存在了如此之久，以至于不需要导火索；它自行爆炸；它自行在内部燃烧。
They called me "the angriest Negro in America." I wouldn't deny that charge. I spoke exactly as Ifelt. "I _believe_ in anger. The Bible says there is a _time_ for anger." They called me "a teacher,a fomenter of violence." I would say point blank,' That is a lie. I'm not for wanton violence, I'm forjustice . I feel that if white people were attacked by Negroes-if the forces of law prove unable, orinadequate, or reluctant to protect those whites from those Negroes-then those white peopleshould protect and defend themselves from those Negroes, using arms if necessary. And I feelthat when the law fails to protect Negroes from whites' attack, then those Negroes should usearms, if necessary, to defend themselves." 
他们称我为"美国最愤怒的黑人".我不会否认这个指控.我说的话正是我所想的."我相信愤怒.圣经说有愤怒的时候."他们称我为"教师,暴力的煽动者".我会直截了当地说,"那是个谎言.我不是鼓吹肆意的暴力,我是为正义而战.我觉得如果白人被黑人攻击——如果法律的力量证明无法,或不充分,或不愿意保护这些白人免受这些黑人的攻击——那么这些白人应该用武器保护和捍卫自己免受这些黑人的攻击.我觉得当法律无法保护黑人免受白人的攻击时,那么这些黑人应该用武器,如果必要的话,来保护自己."
"Malcolm X Advocates Armed Negroes!" 
马尔科姆·X倡导武装黑人！
What was wrong with that? I'll tell you what was wrong. I was a black man talking about physicaldefense against the white man. The white man can lynch and burn and bomb and beat 
那有什么不对？我告诉你有什么不对。我是一个黑人，谈论如何抵御白人。白人可以私刑、烧、炸、打。
 Negroes-that's all right: "Have patience" . . ."The customs are entrenched" . . ."Things are gettingbetter." 
黑鬼——没关系：“要有耐心”……“习俗是根深蒂固的”……“情况正在好转。”
Well, I believe it's a crime for anyone who is being brutalized to continue to accept that brutalitywithout doing something to defend himself. If that's how "Christian" philosophy is interpreted, ifthat's what Gandhian philosophy teaches, well, then, I will call them criminal philosophies. 
嗯，我相信对于任何被虐待的人来说，继续接受这种虐待而不采取任何自我防卫的行动是一种犯罪。如果这就是"基督教"哲学的解释，如果这就是甘地哲学的教导，那么，我会称它们为犯罪的哲学。
I tried in every speech I made to clarify my new position regarding white people-"I don't speakagainst the sincere, well-meaning, good white people. I have learned that there _are_ some. Ihave learned that not all white people are racists. I am speaking against and my fight is againstthe white _racists_. I firmly believe that Negroes have the right to fight against these racists, byany means that are necessary." 
我在每次演说中都试图阐明我对白人的新看法——“我不是反对真诚、善意、善良的白人。我了解到他们是有的。我了解到并非所有的白人都是种族主义者。我反对的是白人种族主义者。我坚信黑人有权利用任何必要的手段来对抗这些种族主义者。”
But the white reporters kept wanting me linked with that word "violence." I doubt if I had oneinterview without having to deal with that accusation. 
但是白人记者们一直想把我与“暴力”这个词联系起来。我怀疑我是否有一场采访不用去处理那个指控。
"I _am_ for violence if non-violence means we continue postponing a solution to the Americanblack man's problem-j ust to _avoid_ violence. I don't go for non-violence if it also means adelayed solution. To me a delayed solution is a non-solution. Or I'll say it another way. If it musttake violence to get the black man his human rights in this country, I'm _for_ violence exactly asyou know the Irish, the Poles, or Jews would be if they were flagrantly discriminated against. I amjust as they would be in that case, and they would be for violence-no matter what theconsequences, no matter who was hurt by the violence." 
我如果非暴力意味着我们继续推迟解决美国黑人的问题，只是为了避免暴力，我就是支持暴力的。如果非暴力也意味着延迟解决，我就不支持非暴力。对我来说，延迟的解决就是没有解决。或者我换一种说法。如果必须用暴力来让黑人在这个国家得到人权，我就是支持暴力的，就像你们知道的那样，如果爱尔兰人、波兰人或者犹太人被公然歧视，他们也会支持暴力。我就是他们那样，他们会支持暴力，不管后果如何，不管暴力伤害了谁。
White society _hates_ to hear anybody, especially a black man, talk about the crime the whiteman has perpetrated on the black man. I have always understood that's why I have been sofrequently called "a revolutionist." It sounds asif _I_ have done some crime! Well, it may be theAmerican black man does need to become involved in a _real_ revolution . The word for"revolution" in German is _Umwalzung_. What it means is a complete overturn-a completechange. The overthrow of King Farouk in Egypt and the succession of President Nasser is anexample of a true revolution. It means the destroying of an old system, and its replacement with anew system. Another example is the Algerian revolution, led by Ben Bella; they threw out theFrench who had been there over 100 years. So how does anybody sound talking about the Negroin America waging some "revolution"? Yes, he is condemning a system-but he's not trying tooverturn the system, or to destroy it. The Negro's so-called "revolt" is merely an asking to be_accepted_ into the existing system! A _true_ Negro revolt might entail, for instance, fighting forseparate black states within this country-which several groups and individuals have advocated,long before Elijah Muhammad came along. 
白人社会讨厌听到任何人，尤其是黑人谈论白人对黑人的犯罪行为。我一直理解这就是为什么我经常被称为“革命者”。听起来好像我做了什么罪行！好吧，也许美国黑人确实需要参与一场真正的革命。德语中的“革命”一词是“Umwalzung”。它的意思是彻底翻转——彻底改变。埃及法鲁克国王的垮台和纳赛尔总统的继位就是一个真正的革命的例子。这意味着摧毁旧制度，取而代之的是新制度。另一个例子是本·贝拉领导的阿尔及利亚革命，他们把在那里呆了100多年的法国人赶走了。那么，有谁能听起来谈论美国的黑人发动一场“革命”呢？是的，他在谴责一个制度，但他并没有试图推翻这个制度，或者摧毁它。黑人的所谓“反抗”只是要求被接纳进入现有的制度！一场真正的黑人革命可能包括，例如，在这个国家为黑人建立单独的州——早在埃利亚·穆罕默德出现之前，就有几个团体和个人提倡过这一点。
When the white man came into this country, he certainly wasn't demonstrating any "non- violence." In fact, the very man whose name symbolizes non-violence here today has stated: 
当白人来到这个国家时，他肯定没有表现出任何“非暴力”。事实上，今天在这里象征非暴力的人曾经说过：
"Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, theIndian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, thescar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward,blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as amatter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragicexperience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject orto feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exaltit. Our children are still taught to respect the violence which reduced a red-skinned people of anearlier culture into a few fragmented groups herded into impoverished reservations.""Peaceful coexistence!" That's another one the white man has always been quick to cry. Fine! Butwhat have been the deeds of the white man? During his entire advance through history, he hasbeen waving the banner of Christianity . . . and carrying in his other hand the sword and theflintlock. 
我们的国家是在种族灭绝中诞生的，当我们接受印第安人是劣等种族的信条时。甚至在我们的海岸上还没有大量的黑人之前，种族仇恨的伤痕就已经丑化了殖民地社会。从16世纪开始，种族优越感的血就流在战斗中。我们也许是唯一一个将种族灭绝作为国家政策来尝试的国家。此外，我们还把那段悲剧性的经历提升为一场高尚的十字军东征。事实上，即使在今天，我们仍然没有允许自己拒绝或对这段可耻的插曲感到遗憾。我们的文学、电影、戏剧、民间故事都颂扬它。我们的孩子仍然被教导要尊重那个将一个早期文化的红皮肤人减少为几个被赶进贫困保留地的碎片的暴力。"和平共处!"这是白人一直很快就会喊出的另一个口号。好吧!但是白人的行为是什么呢?在他整个历史进步的过程中，他一直挥舞着基督教的旗帜……而在他的另一只手中，他拿着剑和燧石枪。
You can go right back to the very beginning of Christianity. Catholicism, the genesis of Christianityas we know it to be presently constituted, with its hierarchy, was conceived in Africa-by thosewhom the Christian church calls "The Desert Fathers." The Christian church became infected withracism when it entered white Europe. The Christian church returned to Africa under the banner ofthe Cross-conquering, killing, exploiting, pillaging, raping, bullying, beating-and teaching whitesupremacy. This is how the white man thrust himself into the position of leadership of the world- through the use of naked physical power. And he was totally inadequate spiritually. Mankind'shistory has proved from one era to another that the true criterion of leadership is spiritual. Menare attracted by spirit. By power, men are _forced_. Love is engendered by spirit. By power,anxieties are created. 
你可以回到基督教的最开始。天主教，基督教的起源，我们今天所知道的基督教，有它的等级制度，是在非洲由那些基督教教会称为“沙漠之父”的人构想出来的。当基督教进入白人欧洲时，教会就染上了种族主义。基督教在十字架的旗帜下重返非洲——征服、杀戮、剥削、洗劫、强奸、欺凌、殴打——并教导白人至上。这就是白人如何通过赤裸裸的武力把自己推到世界领导地位的方式。他在精神上完全不合格。人类的历史证明，从一个时代到另一个时代，真正的领导力标准是精神。人们被精神所吸引。通过权力，人们是被迫的。爱是由精神产生的。通过权力，焦虑被创造出来。
I am in agreement one hundred per cent with those racists who say that no government laws evercam _force_ brotherhood. The only true world solution today is governments guided by truereligion-of the spirit. Here in race-torn America, I am convinced that the Islam religion isdesperately needed, particularly by the American black man. The black man needs to reflect thathe has been America's most fervent Christian-and where has it gotten him? In fact, in the whiteman's hands, in the white man's interpretation . . . where has Christianity brought this _world_? 
我完全同意那些种族主义者的话，他们说政府的法律永远不能强迫兄弟情谊。今天唯一真正的世界解决方案是政府受到更真实的灵性宗教的引导。在这个种族撕裂的美国，我深信伊斯兰教是迫切需要的，特别是对美国黑人来说。黑人需要反思，他是美国最虔诚的基督教徒——那又怎么样呢？事实上，在白人手中，在白人的解释下……基督教给这个世界带来了什么？
It has brought the non-white two-thirds of the human population to rebellion. Two-thirds of thehuman population today is telling the one-third minority white man, "Get out!" And the white manis leaving. And as he leaves, we seethe non-white peoples returning in a rush to their originalreligions, which had been labeled "pagan" by the conquering white man. Only one religion-Islam- had the power to stand and fight the white man's Christianity for a _thousand years_! Only Islamcould keep white Christianity at bay. 
它使人类三分之二的非白种人起来造反。今天，三分之二的人类人口在对三分之一的少数白人说：“滚出去！”而白人正在离开。当他离开时，我们看到非白种人纷纷回归他们原来的宗教，这些宗教被征服的白人贴上了“异教徒”的标签。只有伊斯兰教有能力站出来，与白人的基督教斗争了整整一千年！只有伊斯兰教才能阻止白人的基督教。
The Africans are returning to Islam and other indigenous religions. The Asians are returning tobeing Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims. 
非洲人正在回归伊斯兰教和其他本土宗教。亚洲人正在回归印度教、佛教和伊斯兰教。
As the Christian Crusade once went East, now the Islamic Crusade is going West. W ith the East- Asia-closed to Christianity, with Africa rapidly being converted to Islam, with Europe rapidlybecoming un-Christian, generally today it is accepted that the "Christian" civilization of America- which is propping up the white race around the world-is Christianity's remaining strongest bastion. 
当基督教的十字军东征时，伊斯兰教的十字军正西征。由于东方的亚洲国家对基督教关闭大门，非洲迅速被伊斯兰教同化，欧洲迅速变得非基督教化，因此，人们普遍认为，作为支撑全世界白种人文明的“基督教”文明，即美国，是基督教最后的坚强堡垒。
Well, if _this_ is so-if the so-called "Christianity" now being practiced in America displays the bestthat world Christianity has left to offer-no one in his right mind should need any much greaterproof that very close at hand is the _end_ of Christianity. 
那么,如果这是如此——如果现在美国所实行的所谓“基督教”显示了基督教世界所能提供的最好——那么任何有理智的人都不需要更多的证据来证明基督教的末日即将来临。
Are you aware that some Protestant theologians, in their writings, are using the phrase "post- Christian era"-and they mean _now_? 
你是否知道有些新教神学家在他们的著作中使用"后基督教时代"一词,他们的意思是现在?
And what is the greatest single reason for this Christian church's failure? It is its failure to combatracism. It is the old "You sow, you reap" story. The Christian church sowed racism- blasphemously; now it reaps racism. 
基督教教会失败的最主要原因是什么?是它没有能够对抗种族主义。这就是“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”的故事。基督教教会种下了种族主义——这是亵渎神明的;现在它收获了种族主义。
Sunday mornings in this year of grace 1965, imagine the "Christian conscience" of congregationsguarded by deacons barring the door to black would-be worshipers, telling them "You can't enter_this_ House of God!" 
想象一下，1965年，神圣的一年，每个星期天的早晨，那些由执事看守的教堂的“基督教良心”，如何阻止黑人信徒进入教堂，对他们说：“你们不能进入上帝的殿堂！”
Tell me, if you can, a sadder irony than that St. Augustine, Florida-a city namedfor the blackAfrican saint who saved Catholicism from heresy-was recently the scene of bloody race riots. 
如果你能,告诉我一个比圣奥古斯丁,佛罗里达州—一个以拯救天主教免于异端的黑非洲圣人命名的城市—最近发生种族流血暴乱更令人悲哀的讽刺。
I believe that God now is giving the world's so-called "Christian" white society its last opportunityto repent and atone for the crimes of exploiting and enslaving the world's non-white peoples. It isexactly as when God gave Pharaoh a chance to repent. But Pharaoh persisted in his refusal togive justice to those whom he oppressed. And, we know, God finally destroyed Pharaoh. 
我相信神现在正给所谓"基督教"的白人社会最后悔改和赎罪的机会，为他们剥削和奴役世界上非白人的罪行。这正如同神给法老悔改的机会。但法老坚持不给那些他压迫的人公正。我们都知道，神最后毁灭了法老。
Is white America really sorry for her crimes against the black people? Does white America havethe capacity to repent-and to atone? Does the capacity to repent, to atone, exist in a majority, inone-half, in even one-third of American white society? 
美国白人真的为她对黑人的罪行感到抱歉吗？美国白人有能力悔改和赎罪吗？悔改和赎罪的能力存在于美国白人社会的大多数、一半甚至三分之一吗？
Many black men, the victims-hi fact most black men-would like to be able to forgive, to forget, thecrimes. 
许多黑人受害者——事实上大多数黑人——希望能够宽恕，忘掉这些罪行。
But most American white people seem not to have it in them to make any serious atonement-todo justice to the black man. 
但是大多数美国白人似乎没有能力对黑人做出任何认真的补偿——伸张正义。
Indeed, how _can_ white society atone for enslaving, for raping, for unmanning, for otherwisebrutalizing _millions_ of human beings, for centuries? What atonement would the God of Justicedemand for the robbery of the black people's labor, their lives, their true identities, their culture,their history-and even their human dignity? 
的确，白人社会又如何能为奴役、强奸、凌辱、虐待数以百万计的人类，以及数世纪以来的种种暴行赎罪呢？正义之神会要求什么样的赎罪，以补偿黑人被掠夺的劳动、生命、真实身份、文化、历史，甚至人类尊严呢？
A desegregated cup of coffee, a theater, public toilets-the whole range of hypocritical"integration"-these are not atonement. 
一杯没有种族隔离的咖啡，一个剧院，公共厕所——所有这些伪善的"融合"——都不是赎罪。
After a while in America, I returned abroad-and this time, I spent eighteen weeks in the MiddleEast and Africa.The world leaders with whom I had private audiences this time included President Gamal AbdelNasser, of Egypt; President Julius K. Nyerere, of Tanzania; President Nnamoi Aziki-we, ofNigeria; Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, of Ghana; President Sekou Toure, of Guinea; PresidentJomo Kenyatta, of Kenya; and Prime Minister Dr. Milton Obote, of Uganda. 
在美国待了一段时间后，我又回到了国外——而且这次我在中东和非洲待了十八个星期。我这次与之有私人会面的世界领导人包括：埃及的贾迈勒·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统；坦桑尼亚的朱利叶斯·尼雷尔总统；尼日利亚的纳莫伊·阿齐基韦总统；加纳的夸梅·恩克鲁玛博士；几内亚的塞古·杜尔总统；肯尼亚的乔莫·肯雅塔总统；以及乌干达的米尔顿·奥博特博士。
I also met with religious leaders-African, Arab, Asian, Muslim, and non-Muslim. And in all of thesecountries, I talked with Afro-Americans and whites of many professions and backgrounds. 
我也见到了宗教领袖——非洲人、阿拉伯人、亚洲人、穆斯林和非穆斯林。在所有这些国家，我都与非洲裔美国人和各种职业和背景的白人交谈过。
An American white ambassador in one African country was Africa's most respected Americanambassador: I'm glad to say that this was told to me by one ranking African leader. We talked foran entire afternoon. Based on what I had heard of him, I had to believe him when he told me thatas long as he was on the African continent, he never thought in terms of race, that he dealt withhuman beings, never noticing their color. He said he was more aware of language differencesthan of color differences. He said that only when he returned to America would he become awareof color differences. 
一位美国白人大使在非洲的一个国家是非洲最受尊敬的美国大使：我很高兴地听到一位高级非洲领导人这样告诉我。我们谈了一个下午。根据我所听到的关于他的事情，当他告诉我只要他在非洲大陆，他从不考虑种族问题，他与人打交道，从不注意他们的肤色时，我必须相信他。他说他更注意语言差异，而不是肤色差异。他说只有当他回到美国时，他才会意识到肤色差异。
I told him, "What you are telling me is that it isn't the American white _man_ who is a racist, butit's the American political, economic, and social _atmosphere_ that automatically nourishes aracist psychology in the white man." He agreed. 
我告诉他：“你告诉我的是，不是美国白种人是种族主义者，而是美国的政治、经济和社会气氛会自动滋养白种人的种族主义心理。”他同意了。
We both agreed that American society makes it next to impossible for humans to meet in Americaand not be conscious of their color differences. And we both agreed that if racism could beremoved, America could offer a society where rich and poor could truly live like human beings. 
我们都同意，在美国社会里，人们几乎不可能见面而不意识到他们肤色的差异。我们都同意，如果种族主义能够消除，美国就能提供一个富人和穷人真正能像人一样生活的社会。
That discussion with the ambassador gave me a new insight-one which I like:that the white manis _not_ inherently evil, but America's racist society influences him to act evilly. The society hasproduced and nourishes a psychology which brings out the lowest, most base part of humanbeings. 
与大使的那次谈话给了我新的见解——一个我喜欢的见解：白人并非天生邪恶，而是美国的种族主义社会影响他做出邪恶的行为。这个社会产生并滋养了一种心理，这种心理会引发人类最卑鄙、最底层的部分。
I had a totally different kind of talk with another white man I met in Africa-who, to me, personifiedexactly what the ambassador and I had discussed. Throughout my trip, I was of course awarethat I was under constant surveillance. The agent was a particularly obvious and obnoxious one; Iam not sure for what agency, as he never identified it, or I would say it. Anyway, this one finallygot under my skin when I found I couldn't seem to eat a meal in the hotel without seeing himsomewhere around watching me. You would have thought I was John Dil-linger or somebody. 
我在非洲遇到另一个白人，他完全不同于大使，他是我所讨论的化身。在整个旅程中，我当然知道我一直在被监视。那个特工尤其明显和讨厌；我不确定他是哪个机构的，因为他从未透露过，如果我知道的话，我会说出来的。不管怎样，这个家伙终于让我抓狂了，我发现我在酒店吃饭时，总能看到他在附近看着我。你可能会认为我是约翰·迪林格或什么人。
I just got up from my breakfast one morning and walked over to where he was and I told him Iknew he was following me, and if he wanted to know anything, why didn't he ask me. He startedto give me one of those too-lofty-to-descend-to-you attitudes. I told him then right to his face hewas a fool, that he didn't know me, or what I stood for, so that made him one of those people wholet somebody else do their thinking; and that no matter what job a man had, at least he ought tobe able to think for himself. That stung him; he let me have it. 
一天早晨，我刚吃完早饭，走到他跟前，我告诉他我知道他在跟踪我，如果他想知道什么，为什么不问我。他开始摆出一副高高在上的样子。我当面告诉他，他是傻瓜，他不了解我，不了解我代表什么，因此他成了那种让别人替他思考的人；不管一个人做什么工作，至少他应该能够独立思考。这让他很生气，他冲我发火了。
I was, to hear him tell it, anti-American, un-American, seditious, subversive, and probablyCommunist. I told him that what he said only proved how little he understood about me. I told himthat the only thing the F.B.I. the C.I.A., or anybody else could ever find me guilty of, was beingopen-minded. I said I was seeking for the truth, and I was trying to weigh-objectively-everythingon its own merit. I said what I was against was strait-jacketed thinking, and strait-jacketedsocieties. I said I respected every man's right to believe whatever his intelligence tells him isintellectually sound, and I expect everyone else to respect my right to believe likewise. 
据他所说，我是反美、非美、煽动叛乱、颠覆、可能是共产党。我告诉他，他所说的话只证明他对我了解很少。我告诉他，联邦调查局、中央情报局或其他任何人能发现我有罪的唯一事情，就是思想开放。我说我正在寻找真理，我正在试图客观地衡量每一件事的价值。我说我反对的是刻板的思维和刻板的社会。我说我尊重每个人有权相信他的智力告诉他什么是智力健全的，我也希望其他人尊重我有同样的权利。
 This super-sleuth then got off on my "Black Muslim" religious beliefs.  I asked him hadn't hisheadquarters bothered to brief him-that my attitudes and beliefs were changed? I told him that theIslam I believed in now was the Islam which was taught in Mecca-that there was no God butAllah, and that Muhammad ibn Abdullah who lived in the Holy City of Mecca fourteen hundredyears ago was the Last Messenger of Allah. 
这个超级侦探竟然以我的"黑穆斯林"宗教信仰为借口。我问他，难道他的总部没有告诉他，我的态度和信仰已经改变了吗？我告诉他，我现在信奉的伊斯兰教是麦加所教的伊斯兰教，只有一个真主，而生活在一千四百年前圣城麦加的穆罕默德·本·阿卜杜拉是真主最后的使者。
Almost from the first I had been guessing about something; and I took a chance-and I reallyshook up that "super-sleuth." From the consistent subjectivity in just about everything he askedand said, I had deduced something, and I told him, "You know, I think you're a Jew with anAnglicized name." His involuntary expression told me I'd hit the button. He asked me how I knew.I told him I'd had so much experience with how Jews would attack me that I usually could identifythem. I told him all I held against the Jew was that so many Jews actually were hypocrites in theirclaim to be friends of the American black man, and it burned me up to be so often called "anti- Semitic" when I spoke things I knew to be the absolute truth about Jews. I told him that, yes, Igave the Jew credit for being among all other whites the most active, and the most vocal,financier, "leader" and "liberal" in the Negro civil rights movement. But I said at the same time Iknew that the Jew played these roles for a very careful strategic reason: the more prejudice inAmerica could be focused upon the Negro, then the more the white Gentiles' prejudice wouldkeep diverted off the Jew. I said that to me, one proof that all the civil rights posturing of so manyJews wasn't sincere was that so often in the North the quickest segregationists were Jewsthemselves. Look at practically everything the black man is trying to "integrate" into for instance; ifJews are not the actual owners, or are not in controlling positions, then they have majorstockholdings or they are otherwise in powerful leverage positions-and do they really sincerelyexert these influences? No! 
几乎从一开始，我就一直在猜测一些事情；我冒险一试，我真的震撼了那个“超级侦探”。从他问的和说的几乎所有事情中的一致主观性，我推断出了一些事情，我告诉他，“你知道，我认为你是一个有着盎格鲁化名字的犹太人。”他的不自觉的表情告诉我，我击中了要害。他问我怎么知道的。我告诉他，我有过太多的经验，知道犹太人会如何攻击我，所以我通常能识别他们。我告诉他，我对犹太人的唯一反对意见是，很多犹太人实际上在他们自称是美国黑人的朋友时是伪君子，这让我非常生气，因为我经常因为说出我知道是绝对真实的关于犹太人的事情而被称为“反犹太主义者”。我告诉他，是的，我给犹太人信用，因为他们在所有其他白人中是最活跃的，最能言善辩的，最能资助，最能领导，最能自由的在黑人公民权利运动中。但同时，我说，我知道犹太人扮演这些角色有一个非常小心的战略原因：在美国，越多的偏见可以集中在黑人身上，那么白人非犹太人的偏见就会被转移开犹太人。我说，对我来说，所有这么多犹太人的公民权利表现不真诚的一个证明是，那么多次在北方，最快的种族隔离主义者都是犹太人自己。看看几乎黑人试图“融入”的所有东西，例如，如果不是犹太人是实际的所有者，或者不在控制位置，那么他们有重大的股票持有，或者他们以其他方式处于强大的杠杆位置——他们真的真诚地行使这些影响吗？不！
And an even clearer proof for me of how Jews truly regard Negroes, I said, waswhat invariablyhappened wherever a Negro moved into any white residential neighborhood that was thicklyJewish. Who would always lead the whites' exodus? The Jews! Generally in these situations,some whites stay put-you just notice who they are: they're Irish Catholics, they're Italians; they'rerarely ever any Jews. And, ironically, the Jews themselves often still have trouble being"accepted." 
我甚至有更清楚的证据来证明犹太人是如何真正看待黑人的，我说，那就是每当一个黑人搬进任何一个犹太人密集的白人住宅区时，总会发生的事情。谁会总是领导白人的出走？犹太人！通常在这种情况下，一些白人会留下来——你只需要注意他们是谁：他们是爱尔兰天主教徒，他们是意大利人；他们很少是犹太人。讽刺的是，犹太人自己往往仍然难以“被接受”。
Saying this, I know I'll hear "anti-Semitic" from every direction again. Oh, yes! But truth is truth. 
说完这些，我知道我又要从四面八方听到“反犹太主义”了。哦，是的！但是真理就是真理。
Politics dominated the American scene while I was traveling abroad this time. In Cairo and againin Accra, the American press wire services reached me with trans-Atlantic calls, asking whom didI favor, Johnson-or Goldwater? 
这次我在国外旅行时,美国的政治占据了中心地位。在开罗和后来在阿克拉,美国新闻社通过跨大西洋电话与我联系,问我支持谁,是约翰逊还是金水?
I said I felt that as far as the American black man was concerned they were both just about thesame. I felt that it was for the black man only a question of Johnson, the fox, or Goldwater, thewolf. 
我说，我觉得，就美国黑人而论，他们都是差不多的。我觉得，对于黑人来说，这仅仅是一个约翰逊，狐狸，还是金水，狼的问题。
"Conservatism" in America's politics means "Let's keep the niggers in their place." And"liberalism" means "Let's keep the _knee_-grows in their place-but tell them we'll treat them a littlebetter; let's fool them more, with more promises." With these choices, I felt that the Americanblack man only needed to choose which one to be eaten by, the "liberal" fox or the "conservative"wolf-because both of them would eat him. 
在美国政治中，“保守主义”的意思是“让黑鬼们安分守己”，而“自由主义”的意思是"让_的膝盖_——在他们的位置上生长——但告诉他们，我们会对他们好一点。让我们用更多的承诺来愚弄他们。“有了这些选择，我觉得美国黑人只需要选择被哪一个吃掉，”自由派“的狐狸还是”保守派"的狼，因为它们都会吃掉他。
I didn't go for Goldwater any more than for Johnson-except that in a wolf's den, I'd always knownexactly where I stood; I'd watch the dangerous wolf closer than I would the smooth, sly fox. Thewolf's very growling would keep me alert and fighting him to survive, whereas I _might_ be lulledand fooled by the tricky fox. I'll give you an illustration of the fox. When the assassination in Dallasmade Johnson President, who was the first person he called for? It wasfor his best friend,"Dicky"-Richard Russell of Georgia. Civil rights was "a moral issue," Johnson was declaring toeverybody-while his best friend was the Southern racist who _led_ the civil rights opposition. Howwould some sheriff sound, declaring himself so against bank robbery-and Jesse James his bestfriend? 
我反对金水和约翰逊的程度是一样的——除了在狼窝里，我总是知道我站在哪里。我会比对狡猾的狐狸更密切地观察危险的狼。狼的咆哮会让我保持警惕，为了生存而与它战斗，而狡猾的狐狸可能会让我昏昏欲睡，被它欺骗。我给你举个狐狸的例子。当达拉斯的暗杀使约翰逊成为总统时，他第一个打电话给谁？是他的最好的朋友——乔治亚的理查德·拉塞尔。民权问题是“道德问题”，约翰逊向所有人宣布，而他最好的朋友是南方的种族主义者，他是民权反对派的领导。一个自称反对银行抢劫的治安官，他的最好的朋友是杰西·詹姆斯，他会是什么样的人？
Goldwater as a man, I respected for speaking out his true convictions-something rarely done inpolitics today. He wasn't whispering to racists and smiling at integrationists. I felt Gold-waterwouldn't have risked his unpopular stand without conviction. He flatly told black men he wasn't forthem-and there is this to consider: always, the black people have advanced further when theyhave seen they had to rise up against a system that they clearly saw was outright against them.Under the steady lullabies sung by foxy liberals, the Northern Negro became a beggar. But theSouthern Negro, facing the honestly snarling white man, rose up to battle that white man for hisfreedom-long before it happened in the North. 
作为一个男人，我尊重戈德华特，因为他说出了自己的真实信念——这在当今的政治中很少发生。他没有对种族主义者窃窃私语，也没有对种族融合主义者微笑。我觉得如果没有信念，戈德沃特不会拿他不受欢迎的立场去冒险。他直截了当地告诉黑人，他不支持他们——有一点需要考虑：当黑人看到他们不得不奋起反抗一个他们清楚地看到是完全反对他们的制度时，他们总是走得更远。在狡猾的自由主义者不断唱着的摇篮曲下，北方黑人变成了乞丐。但是南方黑人，面对诚实咆哮的白人，早在北方发生之前，就奋起与白人为自由而战。
Anyway, I didn't feel that Goldwater was any better for black men than Johnson, or vice-versa. Iwasn't in the United States at election time, but if I had been, I wouldn't have put myself in theposition of voting for either candidate for the Presidency, or of recommending to any black man todo so.  It has turned out that it's Johnson in the White House-and black votes were a major factorin his winning as decisively as he wanted to. If it had been Goldwater, all I am saying is that theblack people would at least have known they were dealing with an honestly growling wolf, ratherthan a fox who could have them half-digested before they even knew what was happening.I kept having all kinds of troubles trying to develop the kind of Black Nationalist organization Iwanted to build for the American Negro. Why Black Nationalism? Well, in the competitiveAmerican society, how can there ever beany white-black solidarity before there is first some blacksolidarity? If you will remember, in my childhood I had been exposed to the Black Nationalistteachings of Marcus Garvey-which, in fact, I had been told had led to my father's murder. Evenwhen I was a follower of Elijah Muhammad, I had been strongly aware of how the BlackNationalist political, economic and social philosophies had the ability to instill within black men theracial dignity, the incentive, and the confidence that the black race needs today to get up off itsknees, and to get on its feet, and get rid of its scars, and to take a stand for itself. 
无论如何，我觉得戈德华特对待黑人并不比约翰逊好，反之亦然。选举时我不在美国，但如果我在，我不会把自己置于为总统投票或推荐任何黑人投票的立场。结果是约翰逊入主白宫，而黑人选票是他在他想要的程度上获胜的一个主要因素。如果换成戈德华特，我只能说，黑人至少会知道他们正在与一个真诚咆哮的狼打交道，而不是一只在他们甚至不知道发生了什么之前就能把他们消化一半的狐狸。我一直试图建立我想要为美国黑人建立的那种黑人国家主义组织，但遇到了各种各样的麻烦。为什么黑人国家主义？好吧，在竞争激烈的美国社会，黑人团结之前，白人和黑人之间如何能有团结？如果你还记得，我的童年时期曾接触到马库斯·加维的黑人国家主义教义，据说这导致了我的父亲被谋杀。即使在我追随埃利亚·穆罕默德的时候，我也强烈意识到黑人国家主义的政治、经济和社会哲学如何能够灌输给黑人种族尊严、激励和信心，这是黑人种族今天需要站起来，站起来，摆脱伤痕，为自己挺身而出的。
One of the major troubles that I was having in building the organization that I wanted-an all-blackorganization whose ultimate objective was to help create a society in which there could existhonest white-black brotherhood-was that my earlier public image, my old so-called "BlackMuslim" image, kept blocking me. I was trying to gradually reshape that image. I was trying to turna corner, into a new regard by the public, especially Negroes; I was no less angry than I hadbeen, but at the same time the true brotherhood I had seen in the Holy World had influenced meto recognize that anger can blind human vision. 
我所面临的一个主要难题是，我试图建立的组织——一个全黑人组织，其最终目标是帮助建立一个可以存在诚实的黑白兄弟关系的社会——因为我的早期公众形象，我以前所谓的“黑穆斯林”形象，一直在阻碍我。我试图逐渐改变这种形象。我试图转变公众，尤其是黑人的看法，我并不比以前不愤怒，但同时我在圣界看到的真正的兄弟情谊影响了我，使我认识到愤怒会使人盲目。
Every free moment I could find, I did a lot of talking to key people whom I knew around Harlem,and I made a lot of speeches, saying: "True Islam taught me that it takes _all_ of the religious,political, economic, psychological, and racial ingredients, or characteristics, to make the HumanFamily and the Human Society complete. 
只要一有空闲时间，我就去找哈莱姆区我认识的一些关键人物谈话，并发表了很多演说，说：“真正的伊斯兰教教导我，要使人类社会和人类家庭完整，需要宗教、政治、经济、心理和种族等所有成分或特性。”
"Since I learned the _truth_ in Mecca, my dearest friends have come to include _all_ kinds-someChristians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, agnostics, and even atheists! I have friends who are calledcapitalists, Socialists, and Communists! Some of my friends are moderates, conservatives,extremists-some are even Uncle Toms! My friends today are black, brown, red, yellow, and_white_!" 
自从我在麦加学到真理以来，我最亲爱的朋友包括各种各样的人，有些是基督徒，有些是犹太人，有些是佛教徒，有些是印度教徒，有些是无神论者，甚至有些是不可知论者！我有朋友被称为资本家、社会主义者和共产党人！我的一些朋友是温和派、保守派和极端派，甚至有些是汤姆叔叔！我今天的朋友是黑人、棕色人、红色人、黄色人和白人！
I said to Harlem street audiences that only when mankind would submit to theOne God whocreated all-only then would mankind even approach the "peace" of which so much _talk_ couldbe heard . . . but toward which so little _action_ was seen. 
我对哈莱姆区的观众说，只有当人类向创造一切的唯一真神低头时，人类才有可能接近那种被谈论得很多但实际上很少见的"和平"。
I said that on the American racial level, we had to approach the black man's struggle against thewhite man's racism as a human problem, that we had to forget hypocritical politics andpropaganda. I said that both races, as human beings, had the obligation, the responsibility, ofhelping to correct America's human problem. The well-meaning white people, I said, had tocombat, actively and directly, the racism in other white people. And the black people had to buildwithin themselves much greater awareness that along with equal rights there had to be thebearing of equal responsibilities. 
我说，在美国种族问题上，我们必须把黑人反对白人种族主义的斗争看作是人的问题，我们必须忘记虚伪的政治和宣传。我说，作为人，两个种族都有义务，有责任帮助纠正美国的人的问题。我说，那些善意的白人必须积极、直接地与他人的种族主义作斗争。黑人必须在自己身上建立更多的意识，即除了平等的权利，还必须承担平等的责任。
I knew, better than most Negroes, how many white people truly wanted to see American racialproblems solved. I knew that many whites were as frustrated as Negroes. I'll bet I got fifty letterssome days from white people. The white people in meeting audiences would throng around me,asking me, after I had addressed them somewhere, "What _can_ a sincere white person do?" 
我比大多数黑人更清楚，有多少白人真心希望解决美国的种族问题。我知道许多白人和黑人一样感到沮丧。我敢打赌，有时候我一天会收到50封白人的信。我在某个地方发表演讲后，白人们会蜂拥而至，围着我问：“一个真诚的白人能做些什么？”
When I say that here now, it makes me think about that little co-ed I told you about, the one whoflew from her New England college down to New York and came up to me in the Nation of Islam'srestaurant in Harlem, and I told her that there was "nothing" she could do. I regret that I told herthat. I wish that now I knew her name, or where I could telephone her, or write to her, and tell herwhat I tell white people now when they present themselves as being sincere, and ask me, oneway or another, the same thing that she asked. 
当我这样说的时候,我想起了那个我告诉你的那个女大学生,她从新英格兰的大学飞到纽约,然后到哈莱姆的伊斯兰国家餐厅来找我,我告诉她"没有什么"她能做的。我后悔我告诉她了。我希望我现在知道她的名字,或者我可以打电话给她,或者写信给她,告诉她我现在告诉白人,当他们表现出真诚,以某种方式问我同样的问题时,她问我同样的问题。
The first thing I tell them is that at least where my own particular Black Nationalist organization,the Organization of Afro-American Unity, is concerned, they can't _join_ us.  I have these verydeep feelings that white people who want to join black organizations are really just taking theescapist way tosalve their consciences. By visibly hovering near us, they are "proving" that theyare "with us." But the hard truth is this _isn't_ helping to solve America's racist problem. TheNegroes aren't the racists. Where the really sincere white people have got to do their "proving" ofthemselves is not among the black _victims_, but out on the battle lines of where America'sracism really _is_-and that's in their own home communities; America's racism is among their ownfellow whites. That's where the sincere whites who really mean to accomplish something have gotto work. 
我首先告诉他们的是，至少就我自己的黑人国家主义组织——非洲裔美国人统一组织而言，他们不能加入我们。我对那些想加入黑人组织的白人有一种非常深的感觉，他们只是在寻找一种逃避现实的方法来安慰自己的良心。通过明显地靠近我们，他们“证明”他们“和我们在一起”。但残酷的事实是，这并不能帮助解决美国的种族主义问题。黑人不是种族主义者。那些真正真诚的白人需要证明自己的地方不是在黑人受害者中间，而是在美国种族主义真正存在的战场上——那就是他们自己的家乡社区；美国的种族主义存在于他们自己的白人同胞中间。那些真正想有所作为的真诚白人需要在那里工作。
Aside from that, I mean nothing against any sincere whites when I say that as members of blackorganizations, generally whites' very presence subtly renders the black organization automaticallyless effective. Even the best white members will slow down the Negroes' discovery of what theyneed to do, and particularly of what they can do-for themselves, working by themselves, amongtheir own kind, in their own communities. 
除此之外，当我指出作为黑人组织的成员，白人的存在通常会使黑人组织自动地变得效率较低时，我并不是针对任何真诚的白人。即使最好的白人成员也会减缓黑人发现他们需要做什么，特别是他们能为自己做什么——独自工作，在他们自己的社区，在他们自己的人群中。
I sure don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but in fact I'll even go so far as to say that I neverreally trust the kind of white people who are always so anxious to hang around Negroes, or tohang around in Negro communities. I don't trust the kind of whites who love having Negroesalways hanging around them. I don't know-this feeling may be a throwback to the years when Iwas hustling in Harlem and all of those red-faced, drunk whites in the afterhours clubs werealways grabbing hold of some Negroes and talking about "I just want you to know you're just asgood as I am-" And then they got back in their taxicabs and black limousines and went backdowntown to the places where they lived and worked, where no blacks except servants hadbetter get caught. But, anyway, I know that every time that whites join a black organization, youwatch, pretty soon the blacks will be leaning on the whites to support it, and before you know it ablack may be up front with a title, but the whites, because of their money, are the real controllers. 
我确实不想伤害任何人的感情，但是事实上，我甚至会说，我从来都不信任那种总是急于和黑人交往，或者在黑人社区里闲逛的白人。我不信任那种喜欢让黑人总是在他们身边转的白人。我不知道——这种感觉可能源自于我在哈莱姆区混的时候，那些在深夜俱乐部喝得满脸通红、醉醺醺的白人总是抓住一些黑人，说“我只是想让你知道，你和我一样好——”然后他们回到他们的出租车和黑色豪华轿车，回到他们生活和工作的地方，那里除了仆人，没有黑人敢去。但是，无论如何，我知道每次白人加入黑人组织，你看着，很快黑人就会依靠白人来支持它，然后在你知道之前，一个黑人可能就会出现在前面，有一个头衔，但是白人，因为他们的钱，才是真正的控制者。
  I tell sincere white people, "Work in conjunction with us-each of us working among our own kind."Let sincere white individuals find all other white people they can who feel as they do-and let themform their own all-white groups, to work trying to convert other white people who are thinking andacting so racist. Let sincere whites go and teach non-violence to white people! 
我告诉真诚的白人，“我们共同合作——我们每个人在自己的群体中工作。” 让真诚的白人找到所有和他们有同样感受的白人——让他们组成自己的全白人群体，努力去改变那些思想和行为如此种族主义的白人。让真诚的白人去教白人非暴力！
We will completely respect our white co-workers. They will deserve every credit. We will givethem every credit. We will meanwhile be working among our own kind, in our own blackcommunities-showing and teaching black men in ways that only other black men can-that theblack man has got to help himself. Working separately, the sincere white people and sincereblack people actually will be working together. 
我们将完全尊重我们的白人同事。他们应得所有的荣誉。我们将给予他们所有的荣誉。与此同时，我们将与我们自己的同类，在我们自己的黑人社区工作，以我们黑人的方式展示和教导黑人男子，只有其他黑人男子才能做到这一点，即黑人男子必须自助。真诚的白人和真诚的黑人实际上将一起工作。
In our mutual sincerity we might be able to show a road to the salvation of America's very soul. Itcan only be salvaged if human rights and dignity, in full, are extended to black men. Only suchreal, meaningful actions as those which are sincerely motivated from a deep sense of humanismand moral responsibility can get at the basic causes that produce the racial explosions in Americatoday. Otherwise, the racial explosions are only going to grow worse. Certainly nothing is evergoing to be solved by throwing upon me and other so-called black "extremists" and"demagogues" the blame for the racism that is in America. 
如果我们能真诚地相互合作，我们也许能找到一条拯救美国灵魂的道路。只有当人权和尊严得到充分的保障，黑人才能得到拯救。只有那些真诚地从深深的人道主义和道德责任感中产生的、有意义的行动，才能触及到导致美国今天种族爆炸的基本原因。否则，种族爆炸只会变得更糟。当然，把美国的种族主义归咎于我和其他所谓的黑人“极端分子”和“煽动家”是永远无法解决问题的。
Sometimes, I have dared to dream to, myself that one day, history may even say that my voice- which disturbed the white man's smugness, and his arrogance, and his complacency-that myvoice helped to save America from a grave, possibly even a fatal catastrophe. 
有时，我甚至敢于梦想，有一天，历史可能会说，我那扰乱了白人自满、傲慢和自以为是的声音，我的声音帮助美国避免了一场可能甚至是致命的灾难。
The goal has always been the same, with the approaches to it as different as mine and Dr. MartinLuther King's non-violent marching, that dramatizes the brutality and the evil of the white managainst defenseless blacks. And in the racial climate of this country today, it is anybody's guesswhich of the"extremes" in approach to the black man's problems might _personally_ meet a fatalcatastrophe first-"non-violent" Dr. King, or so-called "violent" me. 
目标始终是一样的,只是我与马丁·路德·金博士采取的方式截然不同,他采取非暴力行进的方式,揭露白人对无助的黑人的暴行和邪恶。而在当今这个国家的种族气氛中,任何关于哪种方式可能首先“个人”遭遇致命灾难的猜测都无济于事——是采取非暴力方式的马丁·路德·金博士,还是所谓的“暴力”方式的我。

Anything I do today, I regard as urgent. No man is given but so much time to accomplishwhatever is his life's work. My life in particular never has stayed fixed in one position for very long.You have seen how throughout my life, I have often known unexpected drastic changes. 
我今天所做的任何事，我都视为紧急的。没有人被给予那么多时间去完成他一生的工作。我的生活特别地，从来没有在一个位置停留很长时间。你已经看到，我一生中经常遇到意想不到的剧变。
I am only facing the facts when I know that any moment of any day, or any night, could bring medeath. This is particularly true since the last trip that I made abroad. I have seen the nature ofthings that are happening, and I have heard things from sources which are reliable. 
当我了解到任何一天、任何时刻，甚至任何夜晚都可能带给我死亡时，我正在面对现实。这尤其在最近我出国旅行之后更加明显。我看到了正在发生的事情的本质，也从可靠的来源听到了一些事情。
To speculate about dying doesn't disturb me as it might some people. I never have felt that Iwould live to become an old man. Even before I was a Muslim-when I was a hustler in the ghettojungle, a nd then a criminal in prison, it always stayed on my mind that I would die a violent death.In fact, it runs in my family. My father and most of his brothers died by violence-my fatherbecause of what he believed in. To come right down to it, if I take the kind of things in which Ibelieve, then add to that the kind of temperament that I have, plus the one hundred per centdedication I have to whatever I believe in-these are ingredients which make it just aboutimpossible for me to die of old age. 
对死亡的揣测并不会像困扰其他人那样困扰我。我从来都没有觉得自己会活到成为一个老人。甚至在我成为穆斯林之前——那时我在贫民窟丛林里当骗子，然后在监狱里当罪犯——我总是想着我会死于暴力。事实上，这在我的家族中是常有的事。我的父亲和他的大部分兄弟都是死于暴力——我父亲是因为他所相信的东西。归根结底，如果我接受我所相信的东西，再加上我所拥有的那种气质，再加上我对我所相信的东西的百分之百的投入——这些因素使得我几乎不可能死于衰老。
*     *     * 
I have given to this book so much of whatever time I have because I feel, and I hope, that if Ihonestly and fully tell my life's account, read objectively it might prove to be a testimony of somesocial value.I think that an objective reader may see how in the society to which I was exposed as a blackyouth here in America, for me to wind up in a prison was really just a bout inevitable. It happens toso many thousands of black youth. 
我已经把这本书给了我所有的空闲时间，因为我感觉，我希望，如果我诚实地、全面地讲述我的生活经历，客观地阅读它可能会证明具有某种社会价值。我认为，一个客观的读者可能会看到，在我所接触的社会中，作为一个美国的黑人青年，我最终被关进监狱真的只是不可避免的。这种情况发生在成千上万的黑人青年身上。
I think that an objective reader may see how when I heard "The white man is the devil," when Iplayed back what had been my own experiences, it was inevitable that I would respond positively;then the next twelve years of my life were devoted and dedicated to propagating that phraseamong the black people. 
我认为一个客观的读者可能会看到，当我听到“白人是魔鬼”时，当我回想起我自己的经历时，我不可避免地会做出积极的反应；然后我接下来的十二年都在致力于在黑人中传播这句话。
I think, I hope, that the objective reader, in following my life-the life of only one ghetto-createdNegro-may gain a better picture and understanding than he has previously had of the blackghettoes which are shaping the lives and the thinking of almost all of the 22 million Negroes wholive in America. 
我想，我希望，客观的读者，通过阅读我这个仅有一个由贫民窟造就的黑人的一生，可能会对美国2200万黑人中的几乎所有人所生活的和思考的黑人贫民窟，有一个比以前更好的了解和认识。
Thicker each year in these ghettoes is the kind of teen-ager that I was-with the wrong kinds ofheroes, and the wrong kinds of influences. I am not saying that all of them become the kind ofparasite that I was. Fortunately, by far most do not. But still, the small fraction who do add up toan annual total of more and more costly, dangerous youthful criminals. The F.B.I. not long agoreleased a report of a shocking rise in crime each successive year since the end of World War II- ten to twelve per cent each year. The report did not say so in so many words, but I am saying thatthe majority of that crime increase is annually spawned in the black ghettoes which the Americanracist society permits to exist. In the 1964 "long, hot summer" riots in major cities across theUnited States, the socially disinherited black ghetto youth were always at the forefront. 
在这些贫民窟中，每年增加的青少年就像我一样，有着错误的英雄和错误的影响。我并不是说他们所有人都会变成我这样的寄生虫。幸运的是，大多数人都没有。但是，仍然有一小部分人加起来构成了每年越来越多的代价高昂、危险的年轻罪犯。联邦调查局不久前发布了一份报告，报告指出自二战结束以来，每年的犯罪率都有惊人的上升，每年上升10%到12%。报告没有明确这么说，但我可以说，这种犯罪率的大部分增长是由美国种族主义社会允许存在的黑人贫民窟每年产生的。在1964年的美国各大城市“漫长而炎热的夏天”骚乱中，社会被剥夺权利的黑人贫民窟青年总是站在最前线。
In this year, 1965, I am certain that more-and worse-riots are going to erupt, in yet more cities, inspite of the conscience-salving Civil Rights Bill. The reasonis that the _cause_ of these riots, theracist malignancy in America, has been too long unattended. 
今年，一九六五年，我敢肯定，尽管有了缓和种族关系的民权法，更多的、更严重的暴动还会在更多的城市爆发。其原因是，种族主义的恶性在美国已经存在了太长的时间，没有得到应有的注意。
I believe that it would be almost impossible to find anywhere in America a black man who haslived further down in the mud of human society than I have; or a black man who has been anymore ignorant than I have been; or a black man who has suffered more anguish during his lifethan I have. But it is only after the deepest darkness that the greatest joy can come; it is only afterslavery and prison that the sweetest appreciation of freedom can come. 
我相信在美国任何一个地方，都很难找到一个像我这样，在人类社会的泥潭中生活得如此之深的黑人；或者比我更无知的黑人；或者在我一生中遭受过比我更多的痛苦的黑人。但是，只有在最深的黑暗之后，才能迎来最大的喜悦；只有在奴役和监狱之后，才能对自由有最甜美的欣赏。
For the freedom of my 22 million black brothers and sisters here in America, I do believe that Ihave fought the best that I knew how, and the best that I could, with the shortcomings that I havehad. I know that my shortcomings are many. 
为了我在这里
My greatest lack has been, I believe, that I don't have the kind of academic education I wish I hadbeen able to get-to have been a lawyer, perhaps. I do believe that I might have made a goodlawyer. I have always loved verbal battle, and challenge. You can believe me that if I had the timeright now, I would not be one bit ashamed to go back into any New York City public school andstart where I left off at the ninth grade, and go on through a degree. Because I don't begin to beacademically equipped for so many of the interests that I have. For instance, I love languages. Iwish I were an accomplished linguist. I don't know anything more frustrating than to be aroundpeople talking something you can't understand. Especially when they are people who look justlike you. In Africa, I heard original mother tongues, such as Hausa, and Swahili, being spoken,and there I was standing like some little boy, waiting for someone to tell me what had been said; Inever will forget how ignorant I felt. 
我相信我最大的不足是我没有得到我希望能得到的那种学术教育——成为一名律师，也许吧。我相信我可能成为一名优秀的律师。我一直热爱口头辩论和挑战。你可以相信我，如果我现在有时间，我一点也不会羞于回到纽约市的任何公立学校，从九年级开始，继续完成学位。因为我对许多我感兴趣的事情还没有学术准备。例如，我喜欢语言。我希望我是一名熟练的语言学家。没有什么比周围的人说你听不懂的语言更令人沮丧的了。尤其是当他们看起来和你一样。在非洲，我听到了诸如豪萨语和斯瓦希里语这样的原始母语，我就像一个小男孩一样站在那里，等待有人告诉我刚才说了什么；我永远不会忘记我感到多么无知。
Aside from the basic African dialects, I would try to learn Chinese, because itlooks as if Chinesewill be the most powerful political language of the future. And already I have begun studyingArabic, which I think is going to be the most powerful spiritual language of the future. 
除了基本的非洲方言，我还想学习中文，因为中文看起来将是未来最强大的政治语言。而且我已经开始学习阿拉伯语，我认为这将是未来最强大的精神语言。
I would just like to _study_. I mean ranging study, because I have a wide-open mind. I'minterested in almost any subject you can mention. I know this is the reason I have come to reallylike, as individuals, some of the hosts of radio or television panel programs I have been on, and torespect their minds-because even if they have been almost steadily in disagreement with me onthe race issue, they still have kept their minds open and objective about the truths of thingshappening in this world. Irv Kupcinet in Chicago, and Barry Farber, Barry Gray and Mike Wallacehi New York-people like them. They also let me see that they respected my mind-in a way I knowthey never realized. The way I knew was that often they would invite my opinion on subjects offthe race issue. Sometimes, after the programs, we would sit around and talk about all kinds ofthings, current events and other things, for an hour or more. You see, most whites, even whenthey credit a Negro with some intelligence, will still feel that all he can talk about is the race issue;most whites never feel that Negroes can contribute anything to other areas of thought, and ideas.You just notice how rarely you will ever hear whites asking any Negroes what they think about theproblem of world health, or the space race to land men on the moon. 
我只是想研究。我的意思是广泛的研究，因为我有一个开放的思想。我对你能提到的几乎任何主题都感兴趣。我知道这就是我真正喜欢的原因，作为一个个体，一些我参加过的广播或电视小组节目的主持人，尊重他们的思想，因为即使他们在种族问题上几乎一直在与我意见不合，他们仍然保持开放和客观的态度，关于这个世界上正在发生的事情的真相。在芝加哥的Irv Kupcinet，纽约的Barry Farber，Barry Gray和Mike Wallace等人。他们也让我看到他们尊重我的思想，我知道他们从未意识到这种方式。我知道的方式是他们经常邀请我对种族问题以外的主题发表意见。有时，节目结束后，我们会坐在一起谈论各种各样的事情，包括时事和其他事情，长达一小时或更长时间。你看，即使白人认为黑人有些聪明，他们仍然会认为他所能谈论的只是种族问题；大多数白人从未觉得黑人能为其他思想和理念做出贡献。你只需要注意到，你很少会听到白人问任何黑人他们对世界健康问题或登月太空竞赛的看法。
*     *     * 
Every morning when I wake up, now, I regard it as having another borrowed day. In any city,wherever I go, making speeches, holding meetings of my organization, or attending to otherbusiness, black men are watching every move I make, awaiting their chance to kill me. I havesaid publicly many times that I know that they have their orders. Anyone who chooses not tobelieve what I am saying doesn't know the Muslims in the Nation of Islam.But I am also blessed with faithful followers who are, I believe, as dedicated to me as I once wasto Mr. Elijah Muhammad. Those who would hunt a man need to remember that a jungle alsocontains those who hunt the hunters. 
每天早晨醒来的时候，现在，我都把它当作又借来的一天。无论我到哪个城市，无论我在哪里做演讲，参加我的组织会议，或者处理其他事务，黑人男子都在看着我做的每一个动作，等待着杀我的机会。我已经公开说过很多次，我知道他们有命令。那些选择不相信我在说什么的人，不了解我在伊斯兰国家的穆斯林。但是，我也很幸运，有忠诚的追随者，我相信他们对我就像我曾经对埃利亚胡·穆罕默德先生一样忠诚。那些想猎杀一个人的人需要记住，丛林里也有猎杀猎人的猎人。
I know, too, that I could suddenly die at the hands of some white racists. Or I could die at thehands of some Negro hired by the white man. Or it could be some brainwashed Negro acting onhis own idea that by eliminating me he would be helping out the white man, because I talk aboutthe white man the way I do. 
我也知道我可能突然死于白人种族主义者的手中。或者我可能死于白人雇佣的黑人手中。或者可能是被洗脑的黑人，出于他自己的想法，认为消灭我会帮助白人，因为我谈论白人的方式就是这样。
Anyway, now, each day I live as if I am already dead, and I tell you what  I would like for you to do.When I _am_ dead-I say it that way because from the things I _know_, I do not expect to live longenough to read this book in its finished form-I want you to just watch and see if I'm not right inwhat I say: that the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with "hate." 
无论如何，现在，我每天都在过着仿佛我已经死了的生活，我告诉你我想要你去做什么。当我真的死了——我说它那样是因为从我所知道的事情来看，我不期待活得足够长去读完这本书的定稿——我希望你只是看着，看看我是否没有说错：白人，在他的报纸上，会把我和“仇恨”联系在一起。
He will make use of me dead, as he has made use of me alive, as a convenient symbol of"hatred"-and that will help him to escape facing the truth that all I have been doing is holding up amirror to reflect, to show, the history of unspeakable crimes that his race has committed againstmy race. 
他会利用我活着和死去，就像他过去利用我一样，把我当作“仇恨”的一个方便的象征——这将帮助他逃避面对一个事实，那就是我一直在做的事情就是举起一面镜子，反映、揭示他的种族对我种族所犯下的那些无法言说的罪行的历史。
You watch. I will be labeled as, at best, an "irresponsible" black man. I have always felt about thisaccusation that the black "leader" whom white men consider to be "responsible" is invariably theblack "leader" who never gets any results. You only get action as a black man if you are regardedby the white man as "irresponsible." In fact, this much I had learned when I was just a little boy.And since I have been some kind of a "leader" of black people here in the racist society ofAmerica, I have been more reassured each time the white man resisted me, or attacked meharder-because each time made me more certain that I was on the right track in the Americanblack man's best interests. The racistwhite man's opposition automatically made me know that Idid offer the black man something worthwhile. 
你看着。我将被贴上“不负责任”的黑人标签。我始终觉得这个指责是这样的：白人认为“负责任”的黑人领导总是没有成果的黑人领导。只有当你被白人视为“不负责任”时，你才会有所行动。事实上，我在还是个小男孩的时候就已经明白了这一点。而且，自从我在美国种族主义社会中成为黑人的某种“领导”以来，每次白人抵制我或更严厉地攻击我，我都会更加确信自己是在为美国黑人的最佳利益而努力。种族主义白人的反对使我自动知道我确实为黑人提供了有价值的东西。
Yes, I have cherished my "demagogue" role. I know that societies often have killed the peoplewho have helped to change those societies. And if I can die having brought any light, havingexposed any meaningful truth that will help to destroy the racist cancer that is malignant in thebody of America-then, all of the credit is due to Allah. Only the mistakes have been mine. 
是的，我珍视我的“煽动者”角色。我知道社会常常会杀死那些帮助改变社会的人。如果我能够死于为社会带来光明，揭露任何有助于摧毁美国体内恶性种族癌的有意义的真相，那么所有的荣誉都归于真主。只有错误是我犯的。
EPILOGUE

ALEX HALEY 
亚历克斯·哈利
During nineteen fifty-nine, when the public was becoming aware of the Muslims after the NewYork telecast "The Hate That Hate Produced," I was in San Francisco, about to retire after twentyyears in the U.S. Coast Guard. A friend returned from a visit to her Detroit home and told me of astartling "black man's" religion, "The Nation of Islam," to which, to her surprise, her entire familywas converted. I listened with incredulity to how a "mad scientist Mr. Yacub" had genetically"grafted" the white race from an original black people. The organization's leader was described as"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad" and a "Minister Malcolm X" was apparently chief of staff. 
1959年，当公众在纽约电视节目“仇恨之恨产生的仇恨”播出后开始关注穆斯林时，我正在旧金山，准备在20年后从美国海岸警卫队退休。一位朋友从底特律的家中回来，告诉我一个令人震惊的“黑人”宗教，“伊斯兰国”，她的全家都信奉了这个宗教，这让她大吃一惊。我难以置信地听着，一个“疯狂的科学家雅各布先生”如何从原始的黑人中“嫁接”了白人种族。该组织的领导人被描述为“尊敬的埃利亚胡·穆罕默德”，而“部长马尔科姆·X”显然担任首席幕僚。
When I entered a civilian writing career in New York City, I collected, around Harlem, a good dealof provocative material and then proposed an article about the cult to the _Reader's Digest_.Visiting the Muslim restaurant in Harlem, I asked how I could meet Minister Malcolm X, who waspointed out talking in a telephone booth right behind me. Soon he came out, a gangling, tall,reddish-brownskinned fellow, at that time thirty-five years old; when my purpose was madeknown, he bristled, his eyes skewering me from behind thehorn-rimmed glasses. "You're anotherone of the white man's tools sent to spy!" he accused me sharply. I said I had a legitimate writingassignment and showed him my letter from the magazine stating that an objective article waswanted, one that would balance what the Muslims said of themselves and what their attackerssaid about them. Malcolm X snorted that no white man's promise was worth the paper it was on;he would need time to decide if he would cooperate or not. Meanwhile, he suggested that I couldattend some of the Harlem Temple Number 7 meetings ("temples" have since been renamed"mosques") which were open to non-Muslim Negroes. 
当我进入纽约市的平民写作生涯时，我在哈莱姆收集了很多挑衅性的材料，然后向《读者文摘》提出了关于邪教的文章。在哈莱姆的穆斯林餐厅，我问如何才能见到正在我身后的电话亭里谈话的马尔科姆·X部长。不久，他出来了，一个瘦长的、红棕色皮肤的高个子，当时35岁；当我的目的被知道时，他怒气冲冲，眼睛从镜框后面刺向我。“你又是白人派来的工具，来监视我！”他尖锐地指责我。我说我有一个合法的写作任务，并给他看了我从杂志上得到的信，信上说想要一篇客观的文章，能够平衡穆斯林对自己和他们的攻击者所说的话。马尔科姆·X哼了一声，说白人的任何承诺都不值一文；他需要时间来决定是否合作。同时，他建议我可以参加哈莱姆第七清真寺（“清真寺”后来被改名为“清真寺”）的一些会议，这些会议对非穆斯林黑人开放。
Around the Muslim's restaurant, I met some of the converts, all of them neatly dressed andalmost embarrassingly polite. Their manners and miens reflected the Spartan personal disciplinethe organization demanded, and none of them would utter anything but Nation of Islam clich‚s.Even excellent weather was viewed as a blessing from Allah, with corollary credit due to "TheHonorable Elijah Muhammad." 
在穆斯林餐馆周围，我遇到了一些皈依者，他们个个衣着整洁，几乎过分客气。他们的举止和仪态反映出组织所要求的严格的个人纪律，他们除了说些伊斯兰教国家的陈词滥调外，什么也不说。甚至好天气也被认为是真主的恩赐，同时也要归功于“尊敬的埃利亚·穆罕默德”。
Finally, Minister Malcolm X told me that he would not take personal responsibility. He said that Ishould talk about an article with Mr. Muhammad personally. I expressed willingness, anappointment was made, and I flew to Chicago. The slightly built, shy-acting, soft-voiced Mr.Muhammad invited me to dinner with his immediate family in his mansion. I was aware that I wasbeing carefully sized up while he talked primarily of F.B.I. and Internal Revenue Service closesurveillance of his organization, and of a rumored forthcoming Congressional probe. "But I haveno fear of any of them; I have all that I need-the truth," Mr. Muhammad said. The subject of mywriting an article somehow never got raised, but Malcolm X proved far more cooperative when Ireturned. 
最后，马尔科姆X部长告诉我他不会承担个人责任。他说我应该和穆罕默德先生就一篇文章进行讨论。我表示愿意，并安排了会面，我飞到了芝加哥。身材瘦削、害羞、声音柔和的穆罕默德先生邀请我和他的直系家人在他的豪宅里共进晚餐。我知道在我谈话的时候，他正在仔细地观察我，而他主要谈论的是联邦调查局和国内税务局对他组织的严密监视，以及有关国会即将进行调查的传闻。“但我对这些都不害怕；我拥有我需要的一切——真理，”穆罕默德先生说。我写一篇文章的话题不知何故没有被提及，但当我回来时，马尔科姆X表现得更加合作。
He would sit with me at a white-topped table in the Muslim restaurant and answer guardedly anyquestions I asked between constant interruptions by callsfrom the New York press in thetelephone booth. When I asked if I could see Muslim activities in some other cities, he arrangedwith other ministers for me to attend meetings at temples in Detroit, Washington, andPhiladelphia. 
他会和我坐在穆斯林餐馆的白桌旁，一边不时地被电话亭里纽约记者的电话打断，一边谨慎地回答我的问题。当我问他是否可以在其他城市看到穆斯林的活动时，他和其他部长安排让我参加底特律、华盛顿和费城寺庙的会议。
My article entitled "Mr. Muhammad Speaks" appeared in early 1960, and it was the first featuredmagazine notice of the phenomenon. A letter quickly came from Mr. Muhammad appreciating thatthe article kept my promise to be objective, and Malcolm X telephoned similar compliments.About this time, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln's book _The Black Muslims in America_ was published andthe Black Muslims became a subject of growing interest. During 1961 and 1962, the _SaturdayEvening Post_ teamed me with a white writer, Al Balk, to do an article; next I did a personalinterview of Malcolm X for _Playboy_ magazine, which had promised to print verbatim whateverresponse he made to my questions. During that interview of several days' duration, Malcolm Xrepeatedly exclaimed, after particularly blistering anti-Christian or anti-white statements: "Youknow that devil's not going to print that!" He was very much taken aback when _Playboy_ kept itsword. 
1960年初，我发表了一篇题为“穆罕默德先生讲话”的文章，这是第一份关于这一现象的专题杂志。穆罕默德先生很快给我来了一封信，感谢这篇文章遵守了我客观的承诺，马尔科姆·X也打来了类似的电话。大约在这个时候，埃里克·林肯博士的书《_美国的黑人穆斯林_》出版了，黑人穆斯林成了人们越来越感兴趣的话题。在1961年和1962年期间，_的《周六晚邮报》_让我和一位白人作家阿尔·巴尔克合作写了一篇文章。接下来，我为_《花花公子》_杂志做了一次对马尔科姆·X的个人采访，该杂志承诺将逐字刊登他对我的问题所做的任何回答。在那次持续了几天的采访中，马尔科姆·X在发表了特别激烈的反基督教或反白人言论后，反复大声说道：“你知道魔鬼不会把它发表出来的！”当_《花花公子》_把它保留下来时，他大吃一惊。
Malcolm X began to warm up to me somewhat. He was most aware of the national periodicals'power, and he had come to regard me, if still suspiciously, as one avenue of access. Occasionallynow he began to telephone me advising me of some radio, television, or personal speakingappearance he was about to make, or he would invite me to attend some Black Muslim bazaar orother public affair. 
马尔科姆·X开始对我有点热情了。他最清楚的是国家期刊的力量，他已经开始把我当作一条途径，如果仍然怀疑的话。现在，他开始偶尔给我打电话，告诉我他将要在电台、电视或个人演讲中露面，或者他会邀请我参加一些黑人穆斯林集市或其他公共活动。
I was in this stage of relationship with the Malcolm X who often described himself on the air as"the angriest black man in America" when in early 1963 my agent brought me together with apublisher whom the _Playboy_ interview had given the idea of the autobiography of Malcolm X. Iwas asked if I felt I could get the now nationally known firebrand to consent to telling the intimatedetails of his entire life. I said I didn't know, but I would ask him.The editor asked me if I couldsketch the likely highlights of such a book, and as I commenced talking, I realized how little Iknew about the man personally, despite all my interviews. I said that the question had made meaware of how careful Malcolm X had always been to play himself down and to play up his leaderElijah Muhammad. 
我是在1963年初与经常在广播中自称"美国最愤怒的黑人"的马尔科姆·X处于这种关系的时候，我的经纪人把我介绍给一位出版商，这位出版商从《花花公子》的采访中得到了写马尔科姆·X自传的想法。我被问到，是否觉得我能说服这位如今在全国知名的煽动者同意讲述他一生的隐秘细节。我说我不知道，但我会问问他。编辑问我是否能勾勒出这样一本书可能的亮点，当我开始说话时，我意识到我对这个人了解得多么少，尽管我采访过他。我说这个问题让我意识到，马尔科姆·X总是非常小心地贬低自己，夸大他的领袖埃利亚·穆罕默德。
All that I knew, really, I said, was that I had heard Malcolm X refer in passing to his life of crimeand prison before he became a Black Muslim; that several times he had told me: "You wouldn'tbelieve my past," and that I had heard others say that at one time he had peddled dope andwomen and committed armed robberies. 
实际上，我所知道的，我曾经说过，就是我听说马尔科姆·X在成为黑人穆斯林之前曾经犯过罪并在监狱里呆过；他曾经多次对我说过：“你不会相信我的过去，”我也听说别人说他曾经贩卖毒品和女人，还犯过持械抢劫罪。
I knew that Malcolm X had an almost fanatical obsession about time. "I have less patience withsomeone who doesn't wear a watch than with anyone else, for this type is not time-conscious," hehad once told me. "In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success orfailure." I knew how the Black Muslim membership was said to increase wherever Malcolm Xlectured, and I knew his pride that Negro prisoners in most prisons were discovering the Muslimreligion as he had when he was a convict. I knew he professed to eat only what a Black Muslim(preferably his wife Betty) had cooked and he drank innumerable cups of coffee which helightened with cream, commenting wryly, "Coffee is the only thing I like integrated." Over ourluncheon table, I told the editor and my agent how Malcolm X could unsettle non-Muslims-as, forinstance, once when he offered to drive me to a subway, I began to light a cigarette and he drily[sic] observed, "That would make you the first person ever to smoke in this automobile." 
我知道马尔科姆·X对时间有一种近乎狂热的痴迷。“我对不戴手表的人比对其他人更没有耐心，因为这种类型的人不重视时间，”他曾经对我说。“在我们所有的行为中，对时间的正确价值和尊重决定了成功或失败。”我知道据说马尔科姆·X在任何地方演讲，黑人穆斯林的会员都会增加，我知道他为黑人囚犯在大多数监狱中发现穆斯林宗教感到自豪，就像他当囚犯时发现的那样。我知道他声称只吃黑人穆斯林（最好是他的妻子贝蒂）煮的食物，他喝无数杯咖啡，用奶油提亮，讽刺地说：“咖啡是我唯一喜欢的‘整合’的东西。”在我们的午餐桌上，我告诉编辑和我的代理人，马尔科姆·X如何能困扰非穆斯林——例如，有一次他提出开车送我去地铁，我开始点烟，他冷淡地观察到：“这将使你成为第一个在汽车里抽烟的人。”
*     *     * 
Malcolm X gave me a startled look when I asked him if he would tell his life story for publication. Itwas one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain. "I will have to give a book a lot ofthought," he finally said. Two days later, he telephoned me to meet him again at the Black Muslimrestaurant. He said, "I'll agree. I think my life story may help people to appreciate better how Mr.Muhammad salvages black people. But I don't want my motives for this misinterpreted byanybody-the Nation of Islam must get every penny that might come to me." Of course, Mr.Muhammad's agreement would be necessary, and I would have to ask Mr. Muhammad myself. 
当我说我是否能为出版物讲述他的生平时，马尔科姆·X给了我一个惊讶的表情。这是我唯一一次看到他不确定。"我必须对一本书进行深思熟虑，"他最后说。两天后，他打电话给我，让我再次在黑人穆斯林餐厅与他会面。他说："我同意。我认为我的生平故事可能会帮助人们更好地理解穆罕默德先生如何拯救黑人。但我不希望任何人误解我这样做的动机——伊斯兰国必须得到我可能得到的每一分钱。"当然，穆罕默德先生的同意是必要的，我必须亲自去问穆罕默德先生。
So I flew again to see Mr. Muhammad, but this time to Phoenix, Arizona, where the Nation ofIslam had bought him the house in the hot, dry climate that relieved his severe bronchialcondition. He and I talked alone this time. He told me how his organization had come far withlargely uneducated Muslims and that truly giant strides for the black man could be made if hisorganization were aided by some of the talents which were available in the black race. He said,"And one of our worst needs is writers"-but he did not press me to answer. He suddenly begancoughing, and rapidly grew worse and worse until I rose from my seat and went to him, alarmed,but he waved me away, gasping that he would be all right. Between gasps, he told me he felt that"Allah approves" the book. He said, "Malcolm is one of my most outstanding ministers." Afterarranging for his chauffeur to return me to the Phoenix airport, Mr. Muhammad quickly bade megood-bye and rushed from the room coughing. 
于是我再次飞往凤凰城去看穆罕默德先生，但这次是在亚利桑那州的凤凰城，伊斯兰教团在那里为他买了一座房子，那里的炎热干燥的气候缓解了他的严重支气管炎。他和我这次单独交谈。他告诉我，他的组织在很大程度上由未受过教育的穆斯林组成，如果他的组织能得到一些黑人种族中可用的才能的帮助，那么黑人就能取得真正巨大的进步。他说：“我们最需要的就是作家。”但他没有催促我回答。他突然开始咳嗽，病情迅速恶化，我从座位上站起来，惊恐地走向他，但他挥手让我走开，喘息着说他会没事的。在喘息之间，他告诉我，他觉得“真主”批准了这本书。他说：“马尔科姆是我最杰出的部长之一。”在安排了他的司机把我送回凤凰城机场后，穆罕默德先生迅速向我道别，然后咳嗽着冲出了房间。
Back East, Malcolm X carefully read and then signed the publication contract, and he withdrewfrom his wallet a piece of paper filled with his sprawling longhand. "This is this book's dedication,"he said. I read: "This book I dedicate to The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, who found me here inAmerica in the muck and mire of the filthiest civilization and society on this earth, and pulled meout, cleaned me up, and stood me on my feet, and made me the man that I am today." 
在东部,马尔科姆·X仔细阅读并签了出版合同,然后他从钱包里抽出一张纸,纸上满是他那潦草的长篇大论。“这是我这本书的献词。”他说。我读道:“我把这本书献给我尊敬的埃利亚·穆罕默德,他把我从美国的泥潭和污秽中找到,把我拉出来,洗净我,让我站稳脚跟,使我成为今天的我。”
The contract provided that all monies accruing to Malcolm X "shall be madepayable by the agentto 'Muhammad's Mosque No. 2,'" but Malcolm X felt this was insufficient. He dictated to me aletter to type for his signature, which I did: "Any and all monies representing my contracted shareof the financial returns should be made payable by the literary agent to Muhammad's Mosque No.2. These payments should be mailed to the following address: Mr. Raymond Sharrieff, 4847Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago 15, Illinois." 
合约规定，所有归马尔科姆·X所有的钱"应由代理人支付给穆罕默德清真寺第二号"，但马尔科姆·X觉得这还不够。他口授了一封要我打字并由他签名的信，我照办了："我合同中所规定的全部收入的任何部分，都应由文学代理人支付给穆罕默德清真寺第二号。这些款项应邮寄到以下地址：雷蒙德·沙里夫先生，芝加哥15号，伊利诺伊州，伍德兰大街4847号。"
Another letter was dictated, this one an agreement between him and me: "Nothing can be in thisbook's manuscript that I didn't say, and nothing can be left out that I want in it." 
又有一封信是由他口述的，这是他和我之间的协议："书中不能有任何我没有说过的话，也不能有任何我想写进去却没写进去的话。"
In turn, I asked Malcolm X to sign for me a personal pledge that however busy he was, he wouldgive me a priority quota of his time for the planned 100,000-word "as told to" book which woulddetail his entire life. And months later, in a time of strain between us, I asked for-and he gave-hispermission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which wouldnot be subject to his review. 
反过来,我请马尔科姆·X为我签署一份个人保证书,无论他有多忙,他都会为我预留一定的时间来完成计划中的10万字的"口述"书,书中将详细讲述他的一生。几个月后,在我俩关系紧张的时候,我请求他——他也同意——在书的最后,我可以写一些自己的评论,这些评论将不会让他审阅。
Malcolm X promptly did begin to pay me two-and three-hour visits, parking his blue Oldsmobileoutside the working studio I then had in Greenwich Village. He always arrived around nine or tenat night carrying his flat tan leather briefcase which along with his scholarly look gave him aresemblance to a hard-working lawyer. Inevitably, he was tired after his long busy day, andsometimes he was clearly exhausted. 
马尔科姆·X立刻开始给我两三个小时的拜访,把他的蓝色Oldsmobile停在我当时在格林尼治村的工作室外面。他总是在晚上九点或十点带着他的平皮浅棕色公文包出现,这个公文包加上他学者般的外表使他看起来像一个勤奋的律师。不可避免的是,经过漫长而忙碌的一天后,他很累,有时甚至显得筋疲力尽。
We got off to a very poor start. To use a word he liked, I think both of us were a bit "spooky."Sitting right there and staring at me was the fiery Malcolm X who could be as acid towardNegroes who angered him as he was against whites in general. On television, in pressconferences, and at Muslim rallies, I had heard him bitterly attack other Negro writers as "UncleToms," "yard Negroes," "black men in white clothes." And there I sat staring at him, proposing tospend a year plumbing his innermost secrets when he had developed a near phobia for secrecyduring his years of crime and his years in the Muslim hierarchy. My twenty years in militaryservice and my Christian religious persuasion didn't help, either; he often jeered publicly at theseaffiliations for Negroes. And although he now would indirectly urge me to write for nationalmagazines about the Muslims, he had told me several times, in various ways, that "you blackswith professional abilities of any kind will one of these days wake up and find out that you mustunite under the leadership of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad for your own salvation." MalcolmX was also convinced that the F.B.I. had "bugged" my studio; he probably suspected that it mayeven have been done with my cooperation. For the first several weeks, he never entered theroom where we worked without exclaiming, "Testing, testing-one, two, three. . . ." 
我们开始得很糟糕。用他喜欢的一个词来说，我想我们俩都有点“鬼鬼祟祟”。坐在那里盯着我看的是那个脾气暴躁的马尔科姆·X，他对待惹他生气的黑人就像对待一般的白人一样尖酸刻薄。在电视上，在新闻发布会上，在穆斯林集会上，我听到他尖刻地攻击其他黑人作家是“托叔叔”、“院子黑人”、“穿着白衣服的黑人”。而我就坐在那里，打算花一年的时间去挖掘他的内心秘密，而他在犯罪和在穆斯林等级制度中的岁月里几乎患上了秘密恐惧症。我在军队服役二十年，还有基督教的宗教信仰，这些都没有帮助；他经常公开嘲笑黑人有这些联系。尽管他现在会间接地敦促我去为全国性的杂志写关于穆斯林的文章，但他以各种方式多次告诉我，“有一天，你们这些有专业能力的黑人会醒来，发现你们必须在尊贵的埃利亚·穆罕默德的领导下团结起来，以求得自身的拯救。”马尔科姆·X也坚信联邦调查局“监听”了我的工作室；他可能怀疑甚至可能是我合作的结果。在最初的几个星期里，他每次进入我们工作的房间都会大喊：“测试，测试——一，二，三……”
Tense incidents occurred. One night a white friend was in the studio when Malcolm X arrived alittle earlier than anticipated, and they passed each other in the corridor. Malcolm X's mannerduring all of that session suggested that his worst doubts had been confirmed. Another time whenMalcolm X sat haranguing me about the glories of the Muslim organization, he was gesturing withhis passport in his hand; he saw that I was trying to read its perforated number and suddenly hethrust the passport toward me, his neck flushed reddish: "Get the number straight, but it won't beanything the white devil doesn't already know. He issued me the passport." 
有一次紧张的事件发生了。一天晚上，当马尔科姆·X比预期早一点到达时，一个白人朋友在工作室里，他们在走廊里擦肩而过。马尔科姆·X在整个会议期间的态度表明，他的最坏的怀疑已经被证实了。还有一次，当马尔科姆·X坐在我身边，对我大谈穆斯林组织的辉煌时，他手里拿着护照在比划；他看到我试图读出护照上的孔号，突然他把护照朝我一推，他的脖子涨得通红：“把号码弄清楚，但这不会是白人魔鬼不知道的事情。他给我发了护照。”
For perhaps a month I was afraid we weren't going to get any book. Malcolm X was still stifflyaddressing me as "Sir!" and my notebook contained almost nothing but Black Muslim philosophy,praise of Mr. Muhammad, and the "evils" of "the white devil." He would bristle when I tried to urgehim that the proposed book was _his_ life. I was thinking that I might have to advise the publisherthat I simply couldn't seem to get through to my subject when the first note of hope occurred. Ihad noticed that while Malcolm X was talking, heoften simultaneously scribbled with his red-inkball-point pen on any handy paper. Sometimes it was the margin of a newspaper he brought in,sometimes it was on index cards that he carried in the back of a small, red-backed appointmentbook. I began leaving two white paper napkins by him every time I served him more coffee, andthe ruse worked when he sometimes scribbled on the napkins, which I retrieved when he left.Some examples are these: 
也许有一个月的时间，我担心我们得不到任何一本书。马尔科姆·X仍然一本正经地称呼我为“先生！”我的笔记本里几乎全是黑人穆斯林的哲学，对穆罕默德先生的赞美，以及“白魔鬼”的“邪恶”。当我试图说服他，这本拟议的书是他的生活时，他会勃然大怒。我正在考虑是否要建议出版商，我似乎无法与我的主题取得联系，这时第一次出现了一线希望。我注意到，当马尔科姆·X讲话时，他经常同时用他的红色圆珠笔在手边的任何纸上乱涂乱画。有时是他带来的报纸的页边空白，有时是在他放在小红皮日历后面的索引卡上。每次我给他端咖啡时，我都会在他身边放两张白色的餐巾纸，而这个计谋奏效了，因为有时他会在这张餐巾纸上乱涂乱画，而我是在他离开时拿回来的。例如：
"Here lies a YM, killed by a BM, fighting for the W M, who killed all the RM." (Decoding that wasn'tdifficult, knowing Malcolm X. "YM" was for yellow man, "BM" for black man, "W M" for white man,and "RM" was for red man.) 
这里躺着一个黄种人，被一个黑种人杀死，为了白种人而战，白种人杀死了所有的红种人。
"Nothing ever happened without cause. Cause BM condition WM won't face. WM obsessed withhiding his guilt." 
没有事情是无缘无故发生的。因为BM条件，WM无法面对。WM痴迷于隐藏他的罪行。
"If Christianity had asserted itself in Germany, six million Jews would have lived." 
如果基督教在德国占据了上风，六百万犹太人就会活着。
"WM so quick to tell BM 'Look what I have done for you!' No! Look what you have done _to_ us !" 
WM很快就对BM说：“看看我为你做了什么！”不！看看你对我们做了什么！
"BM dealing with W M who put our eyes out, now he condemns us because we cannot see." 
与夺去我们视力的W M打交道的BM，现在谴责我们看不见。
"Only persons really changed history those who changed men's thinking about themselves. Hitleras well as Jesus, Stalin as well as Buddha . . . Hon. Elijah Muhammad. . . ." 
只有真正改变了人们对自身的思考的人才能真正地改变历史。希特勒和耶稣，斯大林和释迦牟尼……尊敬的埃利亚·穆罕默德……
It was through a clue from one of the scribblings that finally I cast a bait that Malcolm X took."Woman who cries all the time is only because she knows she can get away with it," he hadscribbled. I somehow raised the subject ofwomen. Suddenly, between sips of coffee and furtherscribbling and doodling, he vented his criticisms and skepticisms of women. "You never can fullytrust any woman," he said. "I've got the only one I ever met whom I would trust seventy-five percent. I've told her that," he said. "I've told her like I tell you I've seen too many men destroyed bytheir wives, or their women. 
我是通过其中一篇涂鸦中的线索，终于设下了一个诱饵，马尔科姆·X上钩了。“总是哭的女人，只是因为她知道她可以逃脱惩罚，”他写道。我无意中提到了女人。突然，在喝咖啡的间隙，他继续涂鸦和涂鸦，发泄他对女人的批评和怀疑。“你永远不能完全信任任何女人，”他说。“我遇到的唯一一个我可以信任75%的女人，我已经告诉她了，”他说。“我告诉你，就像我告诉她我已经看到太多男人被他们的妻子或女人毁掉一样。”
"I don't _completely_ trust anyone," he went on, "not even myself. I have seen too many mendestroy themselves. Other people I trust from not at all to highly, like The Honorable ElijahMuhammad." Malcolm X looked squarely at me . "You I trust about twenty-five per cent." 
“我并不完全信任任何人，”他继续说，“甚至不信任我自己。我看到过太多人毁灭自己。我对其他人从不信任到高度信任，比如尊贵的埃利亚·穆罕默德。”马尔科姆·X直视着我。“我对你信任大约百分之二十五。”
Trying to keep Malcolm X talking, I mined the woman theme for all it was worth. Triumphantly, heexclaimed, "Do you know why Benedict Arnold turned traitor-a woman!" He said, "Whatever elsea woman is, I don't care who the woman is, it starts with her being vain. I'll prove it, somethingyou can do anytime you want, and I know what I'm talking about, I've done it. You think of thehardest-looking, meanest-acting woman you know, one of those women who never smiles. Well,every day you see that woman you look her right in the eyes and tell her 'I think you're beautiful,'and you watch what happens. The first day she may curse you out, the second day, too-but youwatch, you keep on, after a while one day she's going to start smiling just as soon as you come insight." 
我尽量让马尔科姆·X多说话，把女人这个主题榨干了所有价值。他得意洋洋地宣称：“你知道本杰明·富兰克林为什么会背叛吗？——一个女人！”他说：“不管女人是什么，我不在乎这个女人是谁，她首先会变得自负。我可以证明这一点，你可以随时去做，我知道我在说什么，我做过。你想想你认识的最丑陋、最凶狠的女人，那些从来都不笑的女人。好吧，每天你看到那个女人，就直视她的眼睛，告诉她‘我觉得你很漂亮’，然后看看会发生什么。第一天她可能会咒骂你，第二天也会——但你看着，继续，过一段时间，有一天她看到你就会开始微笑。”
When Malcolm X left that night, I retrieved napkin scribblings that further documented how hecould be talking about one thing and thinking of something else: 
马尔科姆·X那天晚上离开时，我取回了餐巾纸上的笔记，这些笔记进一步记录了他是如何说着一件事，却在想另一件事的。
"Negroes have too much righteousness. WM says, 'I want this piece of land, how do I get thosecouple of thousand BM on it off?'" 
黑人太正义了。WM说：“我想要这块地，我怎么把那几千个BM从上面赶走？”
"I have wife who understands, or even if she doesn't she at least pretends.""BM struggle never gets open support from abroad it needs unless BM first forms own unitedfront." 
我有一个理解我的妻子，即使她不理解，她也会假装理解。BM的斗争从未得到国外的公开支持，除非BM首先形成自己的统一战线。
"Sit down, talk with people with brains I respect, all of us want same thing, do somebrainstorming." 
坐下，和我尊重的有头脑的人交谈，我们所有人都想要同样的事情，做一些头脑风暴。
"Would be shocking to reveal names of the BM leaders who have secretly met with THEM." (Thecapitalized letters stood for The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.) 
揭示那些秘密会见他们的黑人领袖的名字将会令人震惊。（首字母大写的THEM指的是尊贵的以利亚穆罕默德。）
Then one night, Malcolm X arrived nearly out on his feet from fatigue. For two hours, he pacedthe floor delivering a tirade against Negro leaders who were attacking Elijah Muhammad andhimself. I don't know what gave me the inspiration to say once when he paused for breath, "Iwonder if you'd tell me something about your mother?" 
然后有一天晚上，马尔科姆·X疲惫不堪地来到这里。两个小时里，他走来走去，对攻击伊利亚·穆罕默德和他自己的黑人领袖们大加挞伐。我不知道是什么激发我在他喘息的时候说了这么一句话：“我想知道你是否可以告诉我一些关于你母亲的事情？”
Abruptly he quit pacing, and the look he shot at me made me sense that somehow the chancequestion had hit him. When I look back at it now, I believe I must have caught him so physicallyweak that his defenses were vulnerable. 
他突然停止踱步，他看我的眼神让我意识到他的机会问题击中了他。现在回想起来，我相信我一定是抓住了他身体虚弱的弱点。
Slowly, Malcolm X began to talk, now walking in a tight circle. "She was always standing over thestove, trying to stretch whatever we had to eat. We stayed so hungry that we were dizzy. Iremember the color of dresses she used to wear-they were a kind of faded-out gray. . . ." And hekept on talking until dawn, so tired that the big feet would often almost stumble in their pacing.From this stream-of-consciousness reminiscing I finally got out of him the foundation for thisbook's beginning chapters, "Nightmare" and "Mascot." After that night, he never again hesitatedto tell me even the most intimate details of his personal life, over the next two years. His talkingabout his mother triggered something.Malcolm X's mood ranged from somber to grim as he recalled his childhood. I remember hismaking a great point of how he learned what had been a cardinal awareness of his ever since:"It's the hinge that squeaks that gets the grease." When his narration reached his moving toBoston to live with his half-sister Ella, Malcolm X began to laugh about how "square" he had beenin the ghetto streets. "Why, I'm telling you things I haven't thought about since then!" he wouldexclaim. Then it was during recalling the early Harlem days that Malcolm X really got carriedaway. One night, suddenly, wildly, he jumped up from his chair and, incredibly, the fearsome blackdemagogue was scat-singing and popping his fingers, "re-bop-de-bop-blap-blam-" and thengrabbing a vertical pipe with one hand (as the girl partner) he went jubilantly lindy-hoppingaround, his coattail and the long legs and the big feet flying as they had in those Harlem days.And then almost as suddenly, Malcolm X caught himself and sat back down, and for the rest ofthat session he was decidedly grumpy. Later on in the Harlem narrative, he grew somber again."The only thing I considered wrong was what I got caught doing wrong. I had a jungle mind, I wasliving in a jungle, and everything I did was done by instinct to survive." But he stressed that hehad no regrets about his crimes, "because it was all a result of what happens to thousands uponthousands of black men in the white man's Christian world." 
慢慢地，马尔科姆·X开始讲话，现在在圈子中走得很紧。“她总是站在炉子旁，试图把我们有的任何东西都拉长。我们饿得头晕。我记得她过去穿的衣服的颜色——它们是一种褪色的灰色……”他继续讲到黎明，累得大脚几乎在踱步时绊倒。从这种意识流的回忆中，我终于从他那里得到了这本书的开头章节“噩梦”和“吉祥物”的基础。那天晚上之后，他再也没有犹豫，甚至在接下来的两年里，告诉我他个人生活中最私人的细节。他谈论他的母亲触发了一些东西。
马尔科姆·X回忆起他的童年时，情绪从沉郁到阴郁。我记得他强调了他是如何学到一个他一直都知道的基本意识的：“这是吱吱作响的铰链得到了润滑。”当他的叙述到达他搬到波士顿和他半姐妹埃拉住在一起时，马尔科姆·X开始笑他在贫民区街道上的“方正”。"为什么，我告诉你我在那时以来就没有想过的事情！"他会大叫。然后，在回忆起早期哈莱姆的日子时，马尔科姆·X真的被带走了。一天晚上，突然，他疯狂地从椅子上跳起来，令人难以置信的是，那个可怕的黑人煽动者正在用“scat-singing”和弹指，"re-bop-de-bop-blap-blam-"，然后用一只手抓住一根垂直的管子（作为女孩伙伴），他欣喜若狂地跳着林迪舞，他的大衣尾和长腿和大脚在哈莱姆的日子里飞舞。然后几乎同样突然，马尔科姆·X抓住自己，坐了下来，然后在那次会议的其余时间里，他明显地变得沮丧。后来在哈莱姆的叙述中，他又变得沉郁起来。“我唯一认为错误的是我被抓住做的错事。我有一个丛林的心，我生活在一个丛林中，我做的每一件事都是出于生存的本能。”但他强调他对他犯下的罪行没有后悔，“因为这一切都是白人基督教世界中的成千上万的黑人所发生的事情的结果。”
His enjoyment resumed when the narrative entered his prison days. "Let me tell you how I'd getthose white devil convicts and the guards, too, to do anything I wanted. I'd whisper to them, 'If youdon't, I'll start a rumor that you're really a light Negro just passing as white.' That shows you whatthe white devil thinks about the black man. He'd rather die than be thought a Negro!" He told meabout the reading he had been able to do in prison: "I didn't know what I was doing, but just byinstinct I liked the books with intellectual vitamins." And another time: "In the hectic pace of theworld today, there is no time for meditation, or for deep thought. A prisoner has time that he canput to gooduse. I'd put prison second to college as the best place for a man to go if he needs todo some thinking. If he's _motivated_, in prison he can change his life." 
当故事提到他坐牢的日子时,他的兴趣又恢复了。“让我告诉你我是如何让那些白人魔鬼犯人和看守做我想做的事的。我会对他们耳语说,‘如果你不这样做,我就开始散布谣言说你其实是个假装白人的浅黑人。’这就说明了白人魔鬼对黑人的看法。他宁愿死也不愿被认为是个黑人!”他告诉我他在监狱里阅读的情况:“我不知道我在做什么,但我凭直觉喜欢那些有智慧营养的书。”还有一次他说:“在当今世界的快节奏中,没有时间去冥想或深入思考。犯人有时间可以好好利用。如果一个人需要思考的话,我会把监狱排在大学之前,认为它是最好的去处。如果他有动力,在监狱里他可以改变自己的生活。”
Yet another time, Malcolm X reflected, "Once a man has been to prison, he never looks at himselfor at other people the same again. The 'squares' out here whose boat has been in smooth watersall the time turn up their noses at an ex-con. But an ex-con can keep his head up when the 'squares' sink." 
马尔科姆·X 又一次沉思道：“一旦一个人坐过牢，他看待自己和他人的目光就会永远改变。那些一辈子都在风平浪静的水域里航行的普通人会轻视一个前囚犯。但前囚犯可以在普通人沉沦时保持头脑清醒。”
He scribbled that night (I kept both my notebooks and the paper napkins dated): "This WMcreated and dropped A-bomb on non-whites; WM now calls 'Red' and lives in fear of other WM heknows may bomb us." 
他那天晚上匆匆写下了（我一直保留着我的笔记本和标注日期的餐巾纸）：“白人创造了并投掷了原子弹在非白人身上；白人现在被称为‘红人’，并且害怕他认识的其他白人可能会对我们进行轰炸。”
Also: "Learn wisdom from the pupil of the eye that looks upon all things and yet to self is blind.Persian poet." 
同时："从那洞察一切却对自己视而不见的眼瞳中学习智慧。——波斯诗人"
At intervals, Malcolm X would make a great point of stressing to me, "Now, I don't want anythingin this book to make it sound that I think I'm somebody important." I would assure him that I wouldtry not to, and that in any event he would be checking the manuscript page by page, andultimately the galley proofs. At other times, he would end an attack upon the white man and,watching me take the notes, exclaim. "That devil's not going to print that, I don't care what hesays!" I would point out that the publishers had made a binding contract and had paid a sizablesum in advance. Malcolm X would say, "You trust them, and I don't. You studied what he wantedyou to learn about him in schools, I studied him in the streets and in prison, where you see thetruth." 
在适当的时候，马尔科姆·X会特别强调对我说：“现在，我不想让这本书的任何内容让我看起来像是个重要人物。”我会向他保证我会尽量避免这种情况，并且无论如何他都会逐页检查手稿，最终会看到校样。在其他时候，他会结束对白人的攻击，看着我做笔记，他会喊道：“不管他说什么，那个魔鬼都不会把那篇报道印出来！”我会指出出版商已经签订了约束性的合同，并且预先支付了一大笔钱。马尔科姆·X会说：“你信任他们，而我不信任。你在学校里学习了他想让你了解他的东西，我在街头和监狱里学习了他，你在那里看到了真相。”
Experiences which Malcolm X had had during a day could flavor his interview mood. The mostwistful, tender anecdotes generally were told on days when some incident had touched him.Once, for instance, he told me that he had learned that a Harlem couple, not Black Muslims, hadnamed their newbornson "Malcolm" after him. "What do you know about _that_?" he keptexclaiming. And that was the night he went back to his own boyhood again and this time recalledhow he used to lie on his back on Hector's Hill and think. That night, too: "I'll never forget the daythey elected me the class president. A girl named Audrey Slaugh, whose father owned a carrepair shop, nominated me. And a boy named James Cotton seconded the nomination. Theteacher asked me to leave the room while the class voted. When I returned I was the classpresident. I couldn't believe it." 
马尔科姆X一天的经历可以影响他的采访情绪。最感伤、最温柔的轶事通常是在某件事情触动他的那一天讲述的。例如，有一次，他告诉我，一对哈莱姆的非穆斯林夫妇给他们的新生儿取名“马尔科姆”，以此来纪念他。“你知道那是什么吗？”他不停地喊道。那天晚上，他又回到了自己的童年，回忆起自己躺在赫克托山丘上思考的日子。那天晚上，他还说：“我永远不会忘记他们选我当班长的那一天。一个名叫奥黛丽·斯劳格的女孩提名我，她父亲拥有一家汽车修理店。一个名叫詹姆斯·柯顿的男孩附议了这个提名。老师让我离开教室，让全班投票。当我回来的时候，我已经是班长了。我简直不敢相信。”
Any interesting book which Malcolm X had read could get him going about his love of books."People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by _one_ book." He came backagain and again to the books that he had studied when in prison. "Did you ever read _The Loomof Language_?" he asked me and I said I hadn't. "You should. Philology, it's a tough science-allabout how words can be recognized, no matter where you find them. Now, you take 'Caesar,' it'sLatin, in Latin it's pronounced like 'Kaiser,' with a hard C. But we anglicize it by pronouncing a softC. The Russians say 'Czar' and mean the same thing. Another Russian dialect says 'Tsar.' JakobGrimm was one of the foremost philologists, I studied his 'Grimm's Law' in prison-all aboutconsonants. Philology is related to the science of etymology, dealing in root words. I dabbled inboth of them." 
马尔科姆·X读过的任何有趣的书都能让他对书产生热爱。“人们没有意识到一本书就能改变一个人的一生。”他在监狱里学习过的书，一次又一次地回来。“你读过《语言织机》吗？”他问我，我说我没有。“你应该读。语法学，这是一门很难的科学，所有关于如何识别单词，无论你在哪里找到它们。现在，你拿“凯撒”，它是拉丁语，在拉丁语中发音像“凯撒”，带有硬C。但是我们把它盎格鲁化，通过发音软C。俄国人说“沙皇”，意思是同样的事情。另一种俄语方言说“沙皇”。雅各布·格林是最重要的语言学家之一，我在监狱里学习了他的《格林定律》——所有关于辅音的。语法学与词源学有关，处理词根。我在两者上都涉猎过。”
When I turn that page in my notebook, the next bears a note that Malcolm X had telephoned mesaying "I'm going to be out of town for a few days." I assumed that as had frequently been thecase before, he had speaking engagements or other Muslim business to attend somewhere and Iwas glad for the respite in which to get my notes separated under the chapter headings theywould fit. But when Malcolm X returned this time, he reported triumphantly, "I have something totell you that will surprise you. Ever since we discussed my mother, I've been thinking about her. Irealized that I had blocked her out of my mind-it was just u npleasant to think about her havingbeen twenty-someyears in that mental hospital." He said, "I don't want to take the credit. It wasreally my sister Yvonne who thought it might be possible to get her out. Yvonne got my brothersWilfred, Wesley and Philbert together, and I went out there, too. It was Philbert who reallyhandled it. 
当我翻开笔记本的那一页时，下一页上写着马尔科姆·X打来电话说"我要离开城外几天"。我原以为像以前一样，他有演讲或其他穆斯林事务要处理，我很高兴有这个机会把笔记按章节标题分类。但是当马尔科姆·X这次回来时，他得意洋洋地报告说"我有件事要告诉你，会让你惊讶的。自从我们讨论了我的母亲后，我就一直在想她。我意识到我已经把她从我的记忆中排除了——想到她已经在精神病院住了20多年，真是太不舒服了。"他说"我不想把功劳占为己有。真正想到可能把她弄出来的是我的妹妹伊冯。伊冯把我的兄弟威尔弗雷德、韦斯利和菲尔伯特召集在一起，我也去了那里。真正处理这件事的是菲尔伯特。"
"It made me face something about myself," Malcolm X said. "My mind had closed about ourmother. I simply didn't feel the problem could be solved, so I had shut it out. I had built upsubconscious defenses. The white man does this. He shuts out of his mind, and he builds upsubconscious defenses against anything he doesn't want to face up to. I've just become awarehow closed my mind was now that I've opened it up again. 
"这让我面对了自己的一些事情，" 马尔科姆·X说。 "我对我们的母亲的看法已经封闭了。我只是觉得这个问题无法解决，所以我把它排除在外。我已经建立了潜意识的防御。白人就是这样做的。他把一些事情排除在他的思维之外，并建立潜意识的防御来对抗他不想面对的事情。我刚刚意识到，当我再次打开我的思维时，它是多么的封闭。
That's one of the characteristics I don't like about myself. If I meet a problem I feel I can't solve, Ishut it out. I make believe that it doesn't exist. But it exists." 
“这是我不喜欢自己性格的其中一个特点。如果我碰到一个我感觉无法解决的问题，我会把它封闭起来。我会假装它不存在。但它确实存在。”
It was my turn to be deeply touched. Not long afterward, he was again away for a few days.When he returned this time, he said that at his brother Philbert's home, "we had dinner with ourmother for the first time in all those years!" He said, "She's sixty-six, and her memory is betterthan mine and she looks young and healthy. She has more of her teeth than those who wereinstrumental in sending her to the institution." 
轮到我被深深感动了。不久以后，他又离开了几天。这次回来的时候，他说在他哥哥菲尔伯特家，“我们好多年以来第一次和妈妈一起吃饭！”他说，“她66岁了，记忆力比我好，看上去年轻健康。她比那些把她送到那家机构的人有更多的牙齿。”

When something had angered Malcolm X during the day, his face would be flushed redder whenhe visited me, and he generally would spend much of the session lashing out bitterly. When someMuslims were shot by Los Angeles policemen, one of them being killed, Malcolm X, upon hisreturn from a trip he made there, was fairly apoplectic for a week. It had been in this mood that hehad made, in Los Angeles, the statement which caused him to be heavily censured by membersof both races. "I've just heard some good news!"-referringto a plane crash at Orly Field in Paris inwhich thirty-odd white Americans, mostly from Atlanta, Georgia, had been killed instantly.(Malcolm X never publicly recanted this statement, to my knowledge, but much later he said tome simply, "That's one of the things I wish I had never said.") 
当马尔科姆·X在白天被激怒时，当他来看我时，他的脸会变得更红，他通常会在大部分时间里痛斥别人。当洛杉矶警察射杀了一些穆斯林，其中一人被杀，马尔科姆·X在从他去那里的旅行回来后，一周内都非常愤怒。他就是在这种心情下，在洛杉矶发表了那番言论，这使他受到了两个种族成员的严厉批评。“我刚听到一个好消息！”——他指的是在巴黎奥利机场发生的一起飞机失事，其中30多名来自佐治亚州亚特兰大的白人美国人立即丧生。（据我所知，马尔科姆·X从未公开收回过这番言论，但后来他简单地对我说：“这是我希望我从未说过的话之一。”）
Anytime the name of the present Federal Judge Thurgood Marshall was raised, Malcolm X stillpractically spat fire in memory of what the judge had said years before when he was theN.A.A.C.P. chief attorney: "The Muslims are run by a bunch of thugs organized from prisons andjails and financed, I am sure, by some Arab group." The only time that I have ever heard MalcolmX use what might be construed as a curse word, it was a "hell" used in response to a statementthat Dr. Martin Luther King made that Malcolm X's talk brought "misery upon Negroes." MalcolmX exploded to me, "How in the hell can my talk do this? It's always a Negro responsible, not whatthe white man does!" The "extremist" or "demagogue" accusation invariably would burn MalcolmX. "Yes, I'm an extremist. The black race here in North America is in extremely bad condition. Youshow me a black man who isn't an extremist and I'll show you one who needs psychiatricattention!" 
每当提到现任联邦法官瑟古德·马歇尔的名字时，马尔科姆X仍然几乎会因为愤怒而喷火，回想起多年前马歇尔作为N.A.A.C.P.首席律师时所说的话：“穆斯林人被一群从监狱和监狱组织起来的恶棍统治，我敢肯定，他们是由某个阿拉伯集团资助的。”我只听说过马尔科姆X用可能被解释为诅咒的词，那就是他对马丁·路德·金博士所说的话的回应：“马尔科姆X的演讲给黑人带来了痛苦。”马尔科姆X对我爆发道：“我怎么能在地狱里说话？总是黑人负责，而不是白人所做的事情！”“极端分子”或“煽动者”的指责总是会让马尔科姆X愤怒。“是的，我是个极端分子。北美黑人的情况非常糟糕。你给我看一个不是极端分子的黑人，我就给你看一个需要精神病治疗的人！”
Once when he said, "Aristotle shocked people. Charles Darwin outraged people. Aldous Huxleyscandalized millions!" Malcolm X immediately followed the statement with "Don't print that, peoplewould think I'm trying to link myself with them." Another time, when something provoked him toexclaim, "These Uncle Toms make me think about how the Prophet Jesus was criticized in hisown country!" Malcolm X promptly got up and silently took my notebook, tore out that page andcrumpled it and put it into his pocket, and he was considerably subdued during the remainder ofthat session. 
有一次他说：“亚里士多德震惊了人们。查尔斯·达尔文激怒了人们。奥尔德斯·赫胥黎震惊了数百万人！”马尔科姆·X立即在后面补充说：“别发表那篇东西，人们会以为我在试图把自己和他们相提并论。”还有一次，他被激怒，大声说：“这些托姆叔叔让我想起了先知耶稣在他的国家是如何被批评的！”马尔科姆·X立刻站起来，默默地拿走我的笔记本，撕下那一页，揉成一团，放进口袋，剩下的时间里他相当平静。
I remember one time we talked and he showed me a newspaper clipping reporting where a Negrobaby had been bitten by a rat. Malcolm X said, "Now, just read that, just think of that a minute!Suppose it was _your_ child!Where's that slumlord-on some beach in Miami!" He continuedfuming throughout our interview. I did not go with him when later that day he addressed a Negroaudience in Harlem and an incident occurred which Helen Dudar reported in the _New YorkPost_. 
我记得有一次我们谈话时，他给我看了一张剪报，报道了一个黑人婴儿被老鼠咬伤的事。马尔科姆·X说：“现在，你只管读读这个，你只管想一想！假使那是你的孩子！那破落户在哪儿呢？在迈阿密的某个海滩上！”他继续在我们的访谈中怒气冲冲。那天稍后，他没有和我一起去哈莱姆区向一个黑人听众发表演说，当时发生了一件事，海伦·杜达尔在《纽约邮报》上作了报道。
"Malcolm speaking in Harlem stared down at one of the white reporters present, the only whitesadmitted to the meeting, and went on, 'Now, there's a reporter who hasn't taken a note in half anhour, but as soon as I start talking about the Jews, he's busy taking notes to prove that I'm anti- Semitic.' 
马尔科姆在哈莱姆演讲时，低头看着在场的一位白人记者，他是唯一被允许参加会议的白人，然后继续说：“现在，有一个记者已经半小时没做笔记了，但只要我一提到犹太人，他立刻忙着做笔记，以证明我是反犹的。”
"Behind the reporter, a male voice spoke up, 'Kill the bastard, kill them all.' The young man, in hisunease, smiled nervously and Malcolm jeered, 'Look at him laugh. He's really not laughing, he'sjust laughing with his teeth.' An ugly tension curled the edges of the atmosphere. Then Malcolmwent on: 'The white man doesn't know how to laugh. He just shows his teeth. But _we_ know howto laugh. We laugh deep down, from the bottom up.' The audience laughed, deep down, from thebottom up and, as suddenly as Malcolm had stirred it, so, skillfully and swiftly, he deflected it. Ithad been at once a masterful and shabby performance." 
记者的背后，一个男声插嘴说：“杀了那个混蛋，把他们都杀了。”年轻人不安地笑着，Malcolm嘲笑说：“看他笑，他真的不是在笑，他只是用牙齿笑。”一种丑陋的紧张气氛在空气中盘旋。然后Malcolm继续说：“白人不知道怎么笑，他们只是露齿而笑。但我们知道怎么笑，我们从心底深处笑，从下往上笑。”观众从心底深处，从下往上笑，Malcolm就像突然搅动它一样，巧妙而迅速地转移了它的注意力。这是一场既巧妙又卑鄙的表演。
I later heard somewhere, or read, that Malcolm X telephoned an apology to the reporter. But thiswas the kind of evidence which caused many close observers of the Malcolm X phenomenon todeclare in absolute seriousness that he was the only 
后来我在某处听说，或者读到，马尔科姆·X给那个记者打过电话道歉。但是这种证据使许多密切关注马尔科姆·X现象的人严肃地断言，他是唯一一个
Negro in America who could either start a race riot-or stop one. When I once quoted this to him,tacitly inviting his comment, he told me tartly, "I don't know if I could start one. I don't know if I'dwant to stop one." It was the kind of statement he relished making. 
美国的黑人，他们可以煽动种族暴乱，也可以制止种族暴乱。有一次我曾当面对他引用过这句话，含蓄地请他发表意见，他尖刻地对我说：“我不知道我能不能煽动暴乱，我也不知道我愿不愿意制止暴乱。”这种话他喜欢说。
*     *     *
Over the months, I had gradually come to establish something of a telephone acquaintance withMalcolm X's wife, whom I addressed as "Sister Betty," as I had heard the Muslims do. I admiredhow she ran a home, with, then, three small daughters, and still managed to take all of the callswhich came for Malcolm X, surely as many calls as would provide a job for an averageswitchboard operator. Sometimes when he was with me, he would telephone home and spend asmuch as five minutes rapidly jotting o n a pad the various messages which had been left for him. 
几个月来，我逐渐与马尔科姆·X的妻子建立了某种电话关系，我叫她“贝蒂姐妹”，因为我听说穆斯林都是这样叫的。我佩服她如何经营一个有三个小女儿的家庭，同时还能应付马尔科姆·X的所有电话，肯定比一个普通接线员的工作量还要多。有时他和我在一起时，会打电话回家，花五分钟的时间迅速地在便签上记下给他留下的各种信息。
Sister Betty, generally friendly enough on the phone with me, sometimes would exclaim inspontaneous indignation, "The man never gets any _sleep_!" Malcolm X rarely put in less than an18-hour workday. Often when he had left my studio at four A.M. and a 40-minute drive laybetween him and home in East Elmhurst, Long Island, he had asked me to telephone him thereat nine A.M. Usually this would be when he wanted me to accompany him somewhere, and hewas going to tell me, after reviewing his commitments, when and where he wanted me to meethim. (There were times when I didn't get an awful lot of sleep, myself.) He was alwaysaccompanied, either by some of his Muslim colleagues like James 67X (the 67th man named"James" who had joined Harlem's Mosque Number 7), or Charles 37X, or by me, but he neverasked me to be with him when they were. I went with him to college and university lectures, toradio and television stations for his broadcasts, and to public appearances in a variety ofsituations and locations. 
贝蒂修女,通常在电话上对我还算客气,有时会突然愤慨地大叫:“这男人从不睡觉!”马尔科姆·X的工作时间通常不少于18小时。他常常在凌晨4点离开我的工作室,在离他在东艾姆赫斯特,长岛的家40分钟车程的地方,他会让我在早上9点给他打电话。通常这是他想让我陪他去某个地方的时候,他会告诉我,在回顾了他的承诺之后,他希望我在何时何地与他会面。(有时我也没怎么睡觉。)他总是由一些穆斯林同事陪同,比如詹姆斯·67X(他是第67个加入哈莱姆清真寺7号的人),或者查尔斯·37X,或者由我陪同,但他从不让我在他有他们陪同的时候陪他。我陪他去大学讲座,去广播电台和电视台做他的广播节目,去各种场合和地点的公开露面。
If we were driving somewhere, motorists along the highway would wave to Malcolm X, the facesof both whites and Negroes spontaneously aglow with the wonderment that I had seen evoked byother "celebrities." No few airline hostesses had come to know him, because he flew so much;they smiled prettily at him, he was in turn the essence of courtly gentlemanliness, and inevitablythe word spread and soon an unusual flow of bathroom traffic would develop,passing where hesat. Whenever we arrived at our destination, it became familiar to hear "There's Malcolm X!""_Where_?" "The tall one." Passers-by of both races stared at him. A few of both races, moreNegroes than whites, would speak or nod to him in greeting. A high percentage of white peoplewere visibly uncomfortable in his presence, especially within the confines of small areas, such asin elevators. "I'm the only black man they've ever been close to who they know speaks the _truth_to them," Malcolm X once explained to me. "It's their guilt that upsets them, not me." He saidanother time, "The white man is afraid of truth. The truth takes the white man's breath and drainshis strength-you just watch  his face get red anytime you tell him a little truth." 
如果我们开车去某个地方，高速公路上的驾车者会向马尔科姆·X挥手，无论是白人还是黑人的面孔都会自发地因我见过的其他“名人”所引发的惊奇而发光。很多空姐都认识他，因为他经常飞行；她们对他微笑，他则是典型的温文尔雅的绅士，而且消息总会传开，很快就会出现异常的浴室流量，经过他坐着的地方。每当我们到达目的地，就会听到“那是马尔科姆·X！”“在哪里？”“那个高个子。”无论是哪种族的人都会盯着他看。两种族的人都有，黑人比白人多，他们会和他打招呼或点头。很多白人在他的面前会感到明显的不舒服，特别是在像电梯这样的小地方。马尔科姆·X曾经向我解释说：“他们见过的唯一的能对他们说真话的黑人就是我。是他们的罪恶感让他们不安，而不是我。”他有一次还说：“白人害怕真理。真理会夺走白人的呼吸，耗尽他的力量——你只要看看他每次听到一点真话时脸就会变红。”
There was something about this man when he was in a room with people. He commanded theroom, whoever else was present. Even out of doors; once I remember in Harlem he sat on aspeaker's stand between Congressman Adam Clayton Powell and the former Manhattan BoroughPresident Hulan Jack, and when the street rally was over the crowd focus was chiefly on MalcolmX. I remember another time that we had gone by railway from New York City to Philadelphiawhere he appeared in the Philadelphia Convention Hall on the radio station WCAU program of EdHarvey. "You are the man who has said 'All Negroes are angry and I am the angriest of all'; is thatcorrect?" asked Harvey, on the air, introducing Malcolm X, and as Malcolm X said crisply, "Thatquote is correct!" the gathering crowd of bystanders stared at him, riveted. 
当他在人们中间时，他有一种特别的气质。他主宰着房间，无论在场的还有谁。甚至在户外也是如此；我记得在哈莱姆，他坐在亚当·克莱顿·鲍威尔国会议员和前曼哈顿区长胡兰·杰克之间的一个讲台上，当街头集会结束后，人们的主要注意力都集中在马尔科姆·X身上。我记得还有一次，我们乘火车从纽约市去费城，他在费城会议中心的WCAU电台节目《埃德·哈维秀》上露面。哈维在广播中问：“你就是那个说过‘所有的黑人都很愤怒，而我是最愤怒的一个’的人吗？”他向马尔科姆·X介绍自己，马尔科姆·X干脆地回答：“那句话是对的！”在场的旁观者们目瞪口呆地看着他。
We had ridden to Philadelphia in reserved parlor car seats. "I can't get caught on a coach, I couldget into trouble on a coach," Malcolm X had said. Walking to board the parlor car, we had passeda dining car toward which he jerked his head, "I used to work on that thing." Riding to ourdestination, he conversationally told me that the F.B.I. had tried to bribe him for information aboutElijah Muhammad; that he wanted me to be sure and read a new book, _Crisis in Black andWhite_ by Charles Silberman-"one of the very few white writers I know with the courage to tell hiskind the truth"; and he asked me to make anote to please telephone the _New York Post's_feature writer Helen Dudar and tell her he thought very highly of her recent series-he did not wantto commend her directly. 
我们乘专用的客厅车厢座位到费城去。“我不能在头等车厢被抓住，我可能在头等车厢惹麻烦，”马尔科姆·X说。我们走向车厢时，他瞥了一眼餐车，“我过去常在那工作。”在去目的地的途中，他随口告诉我联邦调查局曾试图贿赂他，以获取关于埃利亚·穆罕默德的信息；他要我一定要读一本新书，查尔斯·西尔伯曼的《黑与白的危机》——“我知道的为数不多的几个有勇气向他的种族说实话的白人作家之一”；他要我记下请给《纽约邮报》的特稿记者海伦·杜达尔打电话，告诉她他非常赞赏她最近的系列报道，他不想直接赞扬她。
After the Ed Harvey Show was concluded, we took the train to return to New York City. The parlorcar, packed with businessmen behind their newspapers, commuting homeward after theirworkdays, was electric with Malcolm X's presence. After the white-jacketed Negro porter hadmade several trips up and down the aisle, he was in the middle of another trip when Malcolm X_sotto-voced_ in my ear, "He used to work with me, I forget his name, we worked right on thisvery train together. He knows it's me. He's trying to make up his mind what to do." The porterwent on past us, poker-faced. But when he came through again, Malcolm X suddenly leanedforward from his seat, smiling at the porter. "Why, sure, I know who you are!" the porter suddenlysaid, loudly. "You washed dishes right on this train! I was just telling some of the fellows you werein my car here. We all follow you!" 
哈维秀结束后，我们乘火车返回纽约。车厢里挤满了下班后在报纸后面打盹的商人，充满了马尔科姆·X的存在感。白衬衫的黑人列车员在过道上来回走了几次后，他正在走另一趟路时，马尔科姆·X在我耳边低声说：“他曾经和我一起工作，我忘了他的名字，我们就在同一辆火车上一起工作。他知道是我。他在想该怎么办。”列车员从我们身边走过，面无表情。但当他再次经过时，马尔科姆·X突然从座位上向前倾身，对列车员微笑。“当然，我认识你！”列车员突然大声说。“你就在这辆火车上洗盘子！我刚告诉一些伙计你在这辆车上。我们都在关注你！”
The tension on the car could have been cut with a knife. Then, soon, the porter returned toMalcolm X, his voice expansive. "One of our guests would like to meet you." Now a young, clean- cut white man rose and came up, his hand extended, and Malcolm X rose and shook theproffered hand firmly. Newspapers dropped just below eye-level the length of the car. The youngwhite man explained distinctly, loudly, that he had been in the Orient for a while, and now wasstudying at Columbia. "I don't agree with everything you say," he told Malcolm X, "but I have toadmire your presentation." 
车厢里的紧张气氛几乎可以用一把刀子割断。不久，搬运工又回到马尔科姆·X跟前，他的声音宏亮。“我们的一位客人想见你。”这时，一位年轻、衣着整洁的白人站起身来，走上前来，伸出手。马尔科姆·X站起身来，紧紧地握住对方伸过来的手。车里的报纸几乎一直垂到他的眼睛水平线。年轻人解释说，他在东方待了一段时间，现在在哥伦比亚大学读书。“我并非同意你说的每句话，”他对马尔科姆·X说，“但我不得不佩服你的阐述。”
Malcolm's voice in reply was cordiality itself. "I don't think you could search America, sir, and findtwo men who agree on everything." Subsequently, to another white man, an older businessman,who came up and shook hands, he said evenly, "Sir, I know how you feel. It's a hard thing tospeak out against mewhen you are agreeing with so much that I say." And we rode on into NewYork under, now, a general open gazing. 
马尔科姆的声音本身就很亲切。“我想你在全美都找不到两个在所有事情上都意见一致的人。”随后，他对另一位走上前来握手的白人老商人说：“先生，我知道你的感受。当你赞同我说的大部分话时，公开反对我是很难的。”我们继续乘车驶向纽约，此时，人们普遍开始注视我们。
In Washington, D.C., Malcolm X slashed at the government's reluctance to take positive steps inthe Negro's behalf. I gather that even the White House took notice, for not long afterward I left offinterviewing Malcolm X for a few days and went to the White House to do a _Playboy_ interviewof the then White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, who grimaced spontaneously when Isaid I was writing the life story of Malcolm X. Another time I left Malcolm X to interview the U.S. 
在华盛顿特区，马尔科姆·X猛烈抨击政府不愿为黑人利益采取积极措施。据我推测，甚至白宫也注意到了这一点，在那之后不久，我停止了对马尔科姆·X的采访几天，并前往白宫为当时的白宫新闻秘书皮埃尔·塞林格做了一次_《花花公子》_的采访，当我说我在写马尔科姆·X的人生故事时，他不由自主地做了个鬼脸。
Nazi Party Commander George Lincoln Rockwell, who frankly stated that he admired the courageof Malcolm X, and he felt that the two of them should speak together across the United States,and they could thus begin a real solution to the race problem-one of voluntary separation of thewhite and black races, with Negroes returning to Africa. I reported this to Malcolm X, who snorted,"He must think I'm nuts! What am _I_ going to look like going speaking with a _devil_!" Yetanother time, I went off to Atlanta and interviewed for _Playboy_ Dr. Martin Luther King. He wasprivately intrigued to hear little-known things about Malcolm X that I told him; for publication, hediscussed him with reserve, and he did say that he would sometime like to have an opportunity totalk with him. Hearing this, Malcolm X said drily, "You think I ought to send him a telegram with mytelephone number?" (But from other things that Malcolm X said to me at various times, I deducedthat he actually had a reluctant admiration for Dr. King.) 
纳粹党指挥官乔治·林肯·洛克威尔，他坦率地说他钦佩马尔科姆·X的勇气，他觉得他们两人应该在美国各地一起讲话，这样他们就可以开始解决种族问题的真正方案——自愿分离白人和黑人种族，黑人返回非洲。我将这个告诉了马尔科姆·X，他嗤之以鼻，“他一定认为我疯了！我要和一个魔鬼一起讲话，我看起来会是什么样子？”还有一次，我去了亚特兰大，为《花花公子》采访马丁·路德·金博士。他私下里对听到关于马尔科姆·X的鲜为人知的事情感到很感兴趣，我告诉他；在发表时，他谨慎地讨论了他，并说他有时想有机会和他谈谈。听到这个，马尔科姆·X冷淡地说，“你认为我应该给他发一份电报，附上我的电话号码吗？”（但是从马尔科姆·X在不同时期对我说的其他事情中，我推断他实际上对马丁·路德·金博士有一种勉强的钦佩。）
Malcolm X and I reached the point, ultimately, where we shared a mutual camaraderie that,although it was never verbally expressed, was a warm one. He was for me unquestionably one ofthe most engaging personalities I had ever met, and for his part, I gathered, I was someone hehad learned he could express himself to, with candor, without the likelihood of hearing it repeated,and likeany person who lived amid tension, he enjoyed being around someone, another man,with whom he could psychically relax. W hen I made trips now, he always asked me to telephonehim when I would be returning to New York, and generally, if he could squeeze it into hisschedule, he met me at the airport. I would see him coming along with his long, gangling strides,and wearing the wide, toothy, good-natured grin, and as he drove me into New York City he wouldbring me up to date on things of interest that had happened since I left. I remember one incidentwithin the airport that showed me how Malcolm X never lost his racial perspective. Waiting for mybaggage, we witnessed a touching family reunion scene as part of which several cherubic littlechildren romped and played, exclaiming in another language. "By tomorrow night, they'll knowhow to say their first English word-_nigger_," observed Malcolm X. 
马尔科姆·X和我最终达到了一个共同的友谊点，尽管我们从未口头表达过，但这是一个温暖的友谊。他是我遇到过的最吸引人的个性之一，而对我来说，我感觉他是一个可以坦诚相待、不必担心听到重复的人，就像任何生活在紧张中的人都喜欢和一个可以放松自己的人在一起一样。现在，每次我去旅行，他都会让我在返回纽约时给他打电话，通常，如果他的日程安排允许，他会去机场接我。我会看到他迈着长长的、笨拙的步伐走来，脸上带着宽大的、露齿的、善良的笑容，然后他会开车送我进城，告诉我我离开后发生的一些有趣的事情。我记得在机场发生的一件事，让我看到了马尔科姆·X从未失去种族视角的一面。在等待我的行李时，我们目睹了一个感人的家庭团聚场景，其中几个天真的小孩嬉戏玩耍，用另一种语言喊叫。马尔科姆·X说：“到了明天晚上，他们就会知道如何说他们的第一个英语单词——黑鬼。”
When Malcolm X made long trips, such as to San Francisco or Los Angeles, I did not go along,but frequently, usually very late at night, he would telephone me, and ask how the book wascoming along, and he might set up the time for our next interview upon his return. One call that Inever will forget came at close to four A.M., waking me; he must have just gotten up in LosAngeles. His voice said, "Alex Haley?" I said, sleepily, "Yes? Oh, _hey_, Malcolm!" His voice said,"I trust you seventy per cent"-and then he hung up. I lay a short time thinking about him and Iwent back to sleep feeling warmed by that call, as I still am warmed to remember it. Neither of usever mentioned it. 
当马尔科姆·X进行长途旅行，比如去旧金山或洛杉矶时，我没有一起去，但经常，通常是深夜，他会给我打电话，询问书的进度，他可能会在他回来后安排我们下次采访的时间。我永远不会忘记的一个电话是在接近凌晨四点打来的，把我吵醒了，他一定是刚在洛杉矶起床。他的声音说：“亚历克斯·哈利？”我说：“是的？哦，嘿，马尔科姆！”他的声音说：“我信任你百分之七十”，然后他挂断了电话。我躺了一会儿，想着他，然后我又睡着了，感到温暖，就像我现在想起它时一样温暖。我们谁也没有提起这件事。
Malcolm X's growing respect for individual whites seemed to be reserved for those who ignoredon a personal basis the things he said about whites and who jousted with him as a _man_. He,moreover, was convinced that he could tell a lot about any person by listening. "There's an art tolistening well," he told me. "I listen closely to the sound of a man's voice when he's speaking. Ican hear sincerity." The newspaper person whom he ultimately came to admire probably morethan any other was the _New York Times_' M. S . Handler. (I was veryhappy when I learned thatHandler had agreed to write this book's Introduction; I know that Malcolm X would have likedthat.) The first time I ever heard Malcolm X speak of Handler, whom he had recently met, hebegan, "I was talking with this devil-" and abruptly he cut himself off in obvious embarrassment."It's a reporter named Handler, from the _Times_-" he resumed. Malcolm X's respect for the mansteadily increased, and Handler, for his part, was an influence upon the inner Malcolm X. "He'sthe most genuinely unprejudiced white man I ever met," Malcolm X said to me, speaking ofHandler months later. "I have asked him things and tested him. I have listened to him talk,closely." 
马尔科姆X对白人的尊重似乎只保留给那些忽视他说关于白人的事，把他当作一个人来对待的人。他还认为，他可以通过倾听来了解一个人。“善于倾听是一门艺术，”他告诉我。“当一个人说话时，我会仔细听他的声音。我能听到真诚。”他最终最崇拜的新闻工作者可能是《纽约时报》的M.S. Handler。（当我得知Handler同意为这本书写序言时，我非常高兴。我知道马尔科姆X会喜欢这个的。）我第一次听到马尔科姆X提到他最近见过的Handler时，他说：“我在和这个魔鬼谈话——”然后他突然中断，显然是尴尬。“他是一个名叫Handler的记者，来自《纽约时报》——”他继续说。马尔科姆X对这个人的尊重稳步增加，而Handler也对内心深处的马尔科姆X产生了影响。“他是我见过的最没有偏见的白人，”几个月后，马尔科姆X对我说。“我问过他一些问题，测试过他。我仔细听他说话。”
I saw Malcolm X too many times exhilarated in after-lecture give-and-take with predominantlywhite student bodies at colleges and universities to ever believe that he nurtured at his core anyblanket white-hatred. "The young whites, and blacks, too, are the only hope that America has," hesaid to me once. "The rest of us have always been living in a lie." 
我看过马尔科姆·X太多次在讲座后的交流中，与主要由白人学生组成的大学和学院群体一起兴奋不已，以至于我永远都不会相信他在内心深处有任何针对白人的普遍仇恨。“年轻人，白人和黑人，都是美国唯一的希望，”他曾经对我说。“我们其余的人一直生活在谎言中。”
Several Negroes come to mind now who I know, in one way or another, had vastly impressedMalcolm X. (Some others come to mind whom I know he has vastly abhorred, but these I will notmention.) Particularly high in his esteem, I know, was the great photographer, usually associatedwith _Life_ magazine, Gordon Parks. It was Malcolm X's direct influence with Elijah Muhammadwhich got Parks permitted to enter and photograph for publication in _Life_ the highly secret self- defense training program of the Black Muslim Fruit of Islam, making Parks, as far as I know, theonly non-Muslim who ever has witnessed this, except for policemen and other agencyrepresentatives who had feigned "joining" the Black Muslims to infiltrate them. "His successamong the white man never has made him lose touch with black reality," Malcolm X said of Parksonce. 
现在有几个黑人让我想起了，我知道他们以这样或那样的方式给Malcolm X留下了深刻的印象。（还有一些人让我想起了，我知道他非常厌恶他们，但我不打算提及他们。）我知道，特别受他尊敬的是伟大的摄影师，通常与《生活》杂志联系在一起的Gordon Parks。正是Malcolm X直接与Elijah Muhammad的影响，使得Parks被允许进入并为《生活》杂志拍摄黑人穆斯林的Fruit of Islam高度保密的自卫训练计划，使Parks成为我所知的唯一一个非穆斯林目睹了这一切的人，除了假装“加入”黑人穆斯林以渗透他们的警察和其他机构代表。“他从未因为白人的成功而失去与黑人现实的联系，”Malcolm X曾经说过Parks。
Another person toward whom Malcolm X felt similarly was the actor OssieDavis. Once in themiddle of one of our interviews, when we had been talking about something else, Malcolm Xsuddenly asked me, "Do you know Ossie Davis?" I said I didn't. He said, "I ought to introduce yousometime, that's one of the finest black men." In Malcolm X's long dealings with the staff of theHarlem weekly newspaper _Amsterdam News_, he had come to admire Executive Editor JamesHicks and the star feature writer James Booker. He said that Hicks had "an open mind, and henever panics for the white man." He thought that Booker was an outstanding reporter; he alsowas highly impressed with Mrs. Booker when he met her. 
马尔科姆·X对另一位同样有好感的人是演员奥西·戴维斯。有一次在我们的访谈中，当我们正在谈论其他事情时，马尔科姆·X突然问我：“你认识奥西·戴维斯吗？”我说不认识。他说：“我应该给你介绍一下，他是最优秀的黑人之一。”在马尔科姆·X与哈莱姆周报《阿姆斯特丹新闻》的工作人员长期打交道的过程中，他开始钦佩执行编辑詹姆斯·希克斯和明星特写作家詹姆斯·布科克。他说希克斯“头脑开放，他从不为白人而恐慌。”他认为布科克是一名出色的记者；当他见到布科克夫人时，他也对她印象深刻。
It was he who introduced me to two of my friends today, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln who was at the timewriting the book _The Black Muslims in America_, and Louis Lomax who was then writing variousarticles about the Muslims. Malcolm X deeply respected the care and depth which Dr. Lincoln wasputting into his research. Lomax, he admired for his ferreting ear and eye for hot news. "If I seethat rascal Lomax running somewhere, I'll grab my hat and get behind him," Malcolm X said once,"because I know he's onto something." Author James Baldwin Malcolm X also admired. "He's sobrilliant he confuses the white man with words on paper." And another time, "He's upset the whiteman more than anybody except The Honorable Elijah Muhammad." 
正是他今天把我介绍给我的两个朋友：当时正在写《美国黑人穆斯林》一书的C.埃里克·林肯博士，以及当时正在写关于穆斯林的各类文章的路易斯·洛马克斯。马尔科姆·X非常尊重林肯博士在研究中投入的关心和深度。他欣赏洛马克斯敏锐的耳朵和对热点新闻的洞察力。“如果我看到那个家伙洛马克斯在某个地方跑，我会抓起帽子跟在他后面，”马尔科姆·X曾经说过，“因为我知道他发现了什么。”作家詹姆斯·鲍德温也是马尔科姆·X欣赏的人。“他太聪明了，以至于他用纸上的文字让白人感到困惑。”还有一次，他说：“除了尊敬的埃利亚胡·穆罕默德之外，他比任何人都更能使白人感到不安。”
Malcolm X had very little good to say of Negro ministers, very possibly because most of them hadattacked the Black Muslims. Excepting reluctant admiration of Dr. Martin Luther 
马尔科姆·X对黑人牧师几乎没什么好话可说，这可能是因为他们中的大多数人都攻击黑人穆斯林。除了对马丁·路德·金博士的勉强赞赏。
King, I heard him speak well of only one other, The Reverend Eugene L. Callender of Harlem'slarge Presbyterian Church of the Master. "He's a preacher, but he's a fighter for the black man,"said Malcolm X. I later learned that somewhere the direct, forthright Reverend Callender hadprivately cornered Malcolm X and had read him the riot act about his general attacks upon theNegro clergy. Malcolm X also admired The Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, in hisCongressmanpolitical role: "I'd think about retiring if the black man had ten like him in Washington." He hadsimilar feelings about the N.A.A.C.P. lawyer, now a New York State Assemblyman, Percy Sutton,and later Sutton was retained as his personal attorney. Among Negro educators, of whomMalcolm X met many in his college and university lecturing, I never heard him speak well of anybut one, Dr. Kenneth B. Clark. "There's a black man with brains gone to bed," Malcolm X told meonce, briefly lapsing into his old vernacular. He had very distinct reservations about Negroprofessional intelligentsia as a category. They were the source from which most of the BlackMuslims' attackers came. It was for this reason that some of his most bristling counter-attacksagainst "these so-called educated Uncle Thomases, Ph.D." were flung out at his audiences atNegro institutions of higher learning. 
国王，我听说他只称赞过一个人，哈莱姆的大卫教会的牧师尤金·L·卡莱德。“他是个传教士，但他是个黑人的斗士，”马尔科姆·X说。后来我了解到，直接、坦率的卡莱德牧师私下里把马尔科姆·X叫到一边，严厉地批评了他对黑人牧师的一贯攻击。马尔科姆·X也欣赏亚当·克莱顿·鲍威尔牧师的政治角色：“如果黑人有十个像他那样的人在华盛顿，我会考虑退休。”他对纽约州众议员、N.A.A.C.P.律师珀西·苏顿也有类似的感觉，后来苏顿被聘为他的私人律师。在马尔科姆·X在大学演讲中遇到的许多黑人教育家当中，我从未听说他称赞过除了肯尼斯·B·克拉克博士之外的任何人。“有一个黑人有头脑上床了，”马尔科姆·X有一次简短地用他的老方言告诉我。他对黑人专业知识分子这一类别有非常明确的保留意见。他们就是大多数黑人穆斯林攻击者的来源。因此，他在黑人高等教育机构的听众面前对“这些所谓的受过教育的托马斯叔叔，博士”发出了最尖锐的反击。
Where I witnessed the Malcolm X who was happiest and most at ease among members of ourown race was when sometimes I chanced to accompany him on what he liked to call "my littledaily rounds" around the streets of Harlem, among the Negroes that he said the "so-called blackleaders" spoke of "as black masses statistics." On these tours, Malcolm X generally avoided thearterial 125th Street in Harlem; he plied the side streets, especially in those areas which werethickest with what he described as "the black man down in the gutter where I came from," thepoverty-ridden with a high incidence of dope addicts and winos. 
我第一次见到马尔科姆·X最快乐、最自在的时候，是在哈莱姆区的街头巷尾，和他一起“做我每天的小巡回”时。他说，那些“所谓的黑人领袖”谈到“黑人群众统计”时，说的就是这些人。马尔科姆·X通常避开哈莱姆区的主干道125街，他走小巷，特别是在那些他称之为“我来自的那种街头黑人”最密集的地方，也就是那些穷困潦倒、吸毒成瘾、醉生梦死的地方。
Malcolm X here indeed was a hero. Striding along the sidewalks, he bathed all whom he met inthe boyish grin, and his conversation with any who came up was quiet and pleasant. "It's justwhat the white devil wants you to do, brother," he might tell a wino, "he wants you to get drunk sohe will have an excuse to put a club up beside your head." Or I remember once he halted at astoop to greet several older women: "Sisters, let me ask you something," he saidconversationally, "have you ever known _one_ white man who either didn't do something to you,or take something from you?" One among that audienceexclaimed after a moment, "I sure_ain't_!" whereupon all of them joined in laughter and we walked on with Malcolm X waving backto cries of "He's _right_!" 
马尔科姆·X在这里确实是一个英雄。他沿着人行道走着，他那孩子般的笑容照亮了他遇到的每一个人，他和任何走过来的人交谈都很安静愉快。“白人恶魔就是这样想让你做的，兄弟，”他可能会告诉一个酒鬼，“他想让你喝醉，这样他就有借口用棍子敲你的头。”我记得有一次他在一个台阶前停下来，向几个年纪较大的妇女打招呼：“姐妹们，让我问你们一个问题，你们有没有遇到过一个白人，他既没有做过伤害你们的事，也没有从你们那里拿过东西？”过了一会儿，人群中的一位女士喊道：“我当然没有！”于是她们都笑了起来，我们继续走着，马尔科姆·X挥手回应着“他说得对！”的欢呼声。
I remember that once in the early evening we rounded a corner to hear a man, shabbily dressed,haranguing a small crowd around his speaking platform of an upturned oblong wooden box withan American flag alongside. "I don't respect or believe in this damn flag, it's there because I can'thold a public meeting without it unless I want the white man to put me in jail. And that's what I'mup here to talk about-these crackers getting rich off the blood and bones of your and my people!"Said Malcolm X, grinning, "He's _working_!" 
我记得有一次在傍晚时分，我们拐过一个街角，听到一个衣衫褴褛的人站在一个倒置的长方形木箱的讲台上，对着一小群人演讲，旁边还插着一面美国国旗。“我不尊重也不相信这面该死的国旗，只有插着它，我才能在公开场合开会，否则白人就会把我关进监狱。这就是我站在这里要谈论的——这些混蛋靠你们和我人民的血和骨头发财！”马尔科姆·X笑着说：“他在工作！”
Malcolm X rarely exchanged any words with those Negro men with shiny, "processed" hairwithout giving them a nudge. Very genially: "Ahhhh, brother, the white devil has taught you to hateyourself so much that you put hot lye in your hair to make it look more like his hair." 
马尔科姆X很少和那些梳着光亮的"烫过的"头发的黑人交谈，除非给他们一点提示。非常和蔼地说："啊，兄弟，白人魔鬼教你如此痛恨自己，以至于你在头发上抹热的碱液，让它看起来更像他的头发。"
I remember another stoopful of women alongside the door of a small grocery store where I hadgone for something, leaving Malcolm X talking across the street. As I came out of the store, onewoman was excitedly describing for the rest a Malcolm X lecture she had heard in MosqueNumber 7 one Sunday. "Oooooh, he _burnt_ that white man, burnt him _up_, chile . . . chile, hetold us we descendin' from black kings an' queens-Lawd, I didn't know it!" Another woman asked,"You believe that?" and the first vehemently responded, "Yes, I _do_!" 
我记得在去一家小杂货店买东西时，我在街对面听到了马尔科姆·X的演讲。当我走出商店时，一位女士正在兴奋地向其他人描述她在某一个星期天在七号清真寺听到的马尔科姆·X的演讲。“哦，他把那个白人烧了，烧得一干二净，孩子……孩子，他告诉我们我们是从黑人国王和王后那里来的——天哪，我不知道！”另一位女士问：“你相信吗？”第一个女人激烈地回答：“是的，我确实相信！”
And I remember a lone, almost ragged guitarist huddled on a side street playing and singing justfor himself when he glanced up and instantly recognized the oncoming, striding figure. "Huh- _ho_!" the guitarist exclaimed, and jum ping up, he snapped into a mock salute. "My _man_!" 
我记得一个几乎衣衫褴褛的独奏吉他手，在一条小巷子里边弹边唱，自娱自乐。他抬头一看，立刻认出了即将到来的、阔步走来的身影。“嘿——嘿！”吉他手叫道，他跳起来，摆出一个模拟的敬礼姿势。“我的人！”
 Malcolm X loved it. And they loved him. There was no question about it: whether he wasstanding tall beside a street lamp chatting with winos, or whether he was firing his radio andtelevision broadsides to unseen millions of people, or whether he was titillating small audiences ofsophisticated whites with his small-talk such as, "My hobby is stirring up Negroes, that's spelled_knee_-grows the way you liberals pronounce it"-the man had charisma, and he had _power_.And I was not the only one who at various tunes marveled at how he could continue to receivesuch an awesome amount of international personal publicity and still season liberally practicallyeverything he said, both in public and privately, with credit and hosannas to "The Honorable ElijahMuhammad." Often I made side notes to myself about this. I kept, in effect, a double-entry set ofnotebooks. Once, noting me switching from one to the other, Malcolm X curiously asked me whatfor? I told him some reason, but not that one notebook was things he said for his book and theother was for my various personal observations about him; very likely he would have becomeself-conscious. "You must have written a million words by now," said Malcolm X. "Probably," Isaid. "This white man's crazy," he mused. "I'll prove it to you. Do you think I'd publicize somebodyknocking me like I do him?" 
马尔科姆·X喜欢它。他们也喜欢他。毫无疑问：无论他是否站在街灯旁与酒鬼聊天，或者他是否在无线电和电视上向看不见的数百万人开火，或者他是否用他的闲聊来挑逗那些对他说：“我的爱好是煽动黑人，那是拼写为_knee_-grows的方式，就像你们自由派人士发音的那样”——这个人有魅力，他有权力。我不是唯一一个在各种场合都惊叹他如何能够继续获得如此惊人的国际个人宣传，同时仍然在公开和私下里几乎每句话都以“尊敬的埃利亚·穆罕默德”的赞誉和赞美为结尾。我经常为此做笔记。实际上，我有一套双记账本。有一次，马尔科姆·X好奇地问我这是为什么？我告诉他一些原因，但没有告诉他一本笔记本是他说的话，另一本是关于他的各种个人观察；他很可能变得自我意识。马尔科姆·X说：“你到现在一定已经写了百万字了。”我说：“可能吧。”他沉思道：“这个白人疯了。”我告诉他：“你必须证明这一点。”“你认为我会像我宣传他那样宣传某人打击我吗？”
*     *     * 
"Look, tell me the truth," Malcolm X said to me one evening, "you travel around. Have you heardanything?" 
“听着，告诉我实话，”一天晚上，马尔科姆·X对我说，“你到处跑，有没有听到什么？”
Truthfully, I told him I didn't know what he had reference to. He dropped it and talked of somethingelse. 
老实说，我告诉他我不知道他指的是什么。他没再追究，谈起了别的事情。
From Malcolm X himself,  I had seen, or heard, a few unusual things which had caused me somelittle private wonder and speculation, and then, with nothing to hang them onto, I had dismissedthem. One day in his car, we had stopped for the red light at an intersection; another car with awhite man driving hadstopped alongside, and when this white man saw Malcolm X, he instantlycalled across to him, "I don't blame your people for turning to you. If I were a Negro I'd follow you,too. Keep up the fight!" Malcolm X said to the man very sincerely, "I wish I could have a whitechapter of the people I meet like you." The light changed, and as both cars drove on, Malcolm Xquickly said to me, firmly, "Not only don't write that, never repeat it. Mr. Muhammad would have afit." The significant thing about the incident, I later reflected, was that it was the first time I hadever heard him speak of Elijah Muhammad with anything less than reverence. 
从马尔科姆·X本人那里，我看到或听到一些不寻常的事情，这些事情引起了我一些小小的私人好奇和猜测，然后，没有可以挂靠的东西，我就把它们抛在脑后。有一天，我们在他的车里，红灯停在十字路口的交汇处；另一辆车，一个白人驾驶，停在我们旁边，当这个白人看到马尔科姆·X时，他立刻向他喊道：“我不怪你们的人转向你。如果我是黑人，我也会跟着你。继续战斗！”马尔科姆·X真诚地对那个人说：“如果我能有一个像你这样的白人分会，我会很高兴的。” 灯变绿了，两辆车都开走了，马尔科姆·X迅速地对我说，坚定地说：“不仅不要写那件事，永远不要重复它。穆罕默德先生会大发雷霆的。” 后来，我反思这个事件，发现它是我第一次听到他用不那么尊敬的方式提及伊利亚·穆罕默德。
About the same time, one of the scribblings of Malcolm X's that I had retrieved had read,enigmatically, "My life has always been one of changes." Another time, this was in September, 
大约在同一时间，我找回的马尔科姆·X的一份手稿神秘地写道：“我的生活总是充满变化。” 另一次，那是九月，
1963, Malcolm X had been highly upset about something during an entire session, and when Iread the _Amsterdam News_ for that week, I guessed that he had been upset about an item inJimmy Booker's column that Booker had heard that Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X werefeuding. (Booker was later to reveal that after his column was written, he had gone on vacation,and on his return he learned that Malcolm X "stormed into the _Amsterdam News_ with threefollowers . . . 'I want to see Jimmy Booker. I don't like what he wrote. There is no fight betweenme and Elijah Muhammad. I believe in Mr. Muhammad and will lay down my life for him.' ") 
1963年，马尔科姆·X在整个会议期间对某件事感到非常不安，当我读到那周的《阿姆斯特丹新闻》时，我猜他是因为吉米·波克的专栏中的一件事而感到不安的。波克后来透露，在他写完专栏后，他去度假了，回来后得知马尔科姆·X“带着三个随从冲进了《阿姆斯特丹新闻》……‘我要见见吉米·波克。我不喜欢他写的东西。我和埃利亚·穆罕默德之间没有争执。我相信穆罕默德先生，愿意为他献出生命。’”
Also, now and then, when I chanced to meet a few other key Muslims, mainly when I was withMalcolm X, but when he was not immediately present, I thought I detected either in subtlephrasing, or in manner, something less than total admiration of their famous colleague-and then Iwould tell myself I had misinterpreted. And during these days, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln and I would talkon the phone fairly often. We rarely would fail to mention how it seemed almost certain that seedsof trouble lay in the fact that however much Malcolm Xpraised Elijah Muhammad, it was upondramatic, articulate Malcolm X that the communications media and hence the general publicfocused the great bulk of their attention. I never dreamed, though, what Malcolm X was actuallygoing through. He never breathed a word, at least not to me, until the actual rift became public. 
另外，有时候，当我碰巧遇到一些其他的穆斯林领袖，主要是在我和马尔科姆·X在一起的时候，但是当他不在场的时候，我察觉到他们对他们的著名同事的赞美似乎并不完全。然后我会告诉自己我误解了。在这些日子里，我和C.埃里克·林肯博士经常通电话。我们很少会忘记提到，似乎几乎可以肯定，问题的种子在于，尽管马尔科姆·X赞扬埃利亚·穆罕默德，但是媒体和公众的大部分注意力都集中在戏剧性的、口才出众的马尔科姆·X身上。然而，我做梦也没想到马尔科姆·X实际上正在经历什么。至少他没有对我吐露过一个字，直到公开的裂痕出现。
When Malcolm X left me at around two A.M. on that occasion, he asked me to call him at nineA.M. The telephone in the home in East Elmhurst rang considerably longer than usual, and SisterBetty, when she answered, sounded strained, choked up. When Malcolm X came on, he, too,sounded different. He asked me, "Have you heard the radio or seen the newspapers?" I said Ihadn't. He said, "Well, do!" and that he would call me later. 
那天晚上两点左右，马尔科姆·X离开我时，他要我在上午九点给他打电话。东艾尔姆赫斯特家里的电话响了相当长的时间，比平时要长，贝蒂修女接电话时，声音显得紧张、哽咽。马尔科姆·X接电话时，他的声音也变了。他问我：“你听了广播，看了报纸吗？”我说没有。他说：“那你去听，去看！”并说他晚些时候再给我打电话。
I went and got the papers. I read with astonishment that Malcolm X had been suspended byElijah Muhammad-the stated reason being the "chickens coming home to roost" remark thatMalcolm X recently had made as a comment upon the assassination of President Kennedy. 
我去取了报纸,惊奇地读到艾利贾力·穆罕默德已把马尔科姆·艾克斯停职,所提出的理由是马尔科姆·艾克斯最近对肯尼迪总统被暗杀发表的"恶有恶报"的评论。
Malcolm X did telephone, after about an hour, and I met him at the Black Muslims' newspaperoffice in Harlem, a couple of blocks further up Lenox Avenue from their mosque and restaurant.He was seated behind his light-brown metal desk and his brown hat lay before him on the greenblotter. He wore a dark suit with a vest, a white shirt, the inevitable leaping-sailfish clip held hisnarrow tie, and the big feet in the shined black shoes pushed the swivel chair pendulously backand forth as he talked into the telephone. 
马尔科姆·X大约一小时后打了电话，我在哈莱姆区黑人穆斯林的报馆见到了他，那地方离他们的清真寺和餐馆有几条街远。他坐在那张浅棕色金属办公桌后面，棕色的帽子放在绿色的墨水盒上。他穿着一套深色西装，打着领结，系着那条必不可少的跳动的飞鱼领带夹，大脚丫子穿着擦得锃亮的黑皮鞋，一边在电话里说话，一边把转椅摇来摇去。
"I'm always hurt over any act of disobedience on my part concerning Mr. Muhammad. . . . Yes, sir- anything The Honorable Elijah Muhammad does is all right with me. I believe absolutely in hiswisdom and authority." The telephone would ring again instantly every time he put it down. "Mr.Peter Goldman! I haven't heard your voice in a good while! Well, sir, I just should havekept my bigmouth shut." To the _New York Times_: "Sir? Yes-he suspended me from making publicappearances for the tune being, which I fully understand. I say the same thing to you that I havetold others, I'm in complete submission to Mr. Muhammad's judgment, because I have alwaysfound his judgment to be based on sound thinking." To C.B.S.: "I think that anybody who is in aposition to discipline others should first learn to accept discipline himself." 
"我对穆罕默德先生的任何不服从行为都感到很受伤。……是的，先生，尊贵的埃利亚·穆罕默德所做的任何事情对我来说都是正确的。我完全相信他的智慧和权威。”每次放下电话，电话就会立刻再次响起。“彼得·戈德曼先生！我已经有一段时间没听到你的声音了！好吧，先生，我应该闭上我的大嘴巴。”对《纽约时报》说：“先生？是的，他因为我暂时禁止我公开露面，我完全理解。我要对你说的是，我对穆罕默德先生的判断完全服从，因为我一直发现他的判断是基于正确的思考。”对哥伦比亚广播公司说：“我认为任何有能力惩罚他人的人首先应该学会接受自我惩罚。”
He brought it off, the image of contriteness, the best be could-throughout the harshly trying nextseveral weeks. But the back of his neck was reddish every time I saw him. He did not yet put intowords his obvious fury at the public humiliation. We did very little interviewing now, he was sobusy on telephones elsewhere; but it did not matter too much because by now I had the bulk ofthe needed life story material in hand. When he did find some time to visit me, he was verypreoccupied, and I could _feel_ him rankling with anger and with inactivity, but he tried hard tohide it. 
他成功地表现出了悔过的样子，尽他所能地在接下来的几个星期里经受住了严峻的考验。但是每次我见到他时，他的后颈总是红红的。他还没有把公开羞辱他的明显怒火用言语表达出来。现在我们很少进行采访，他忙于在其他地方打电话；但这并不太重要，因为我现在已经掌握了大部分需要的生活故事材料。当他有时间来看我时，他非常心烦意乱，我能感觉到他因愤怒和无所事事而烦恼，但他尽力隐藏起来。
He scribbled one night, "You have not converted a man because you have silenced him. JohnViscount Morley." And the same night, almost illegibly, "I was going downhill until he picked meup, but the more I think of it, we picked each other up." 
他有一天晚上写道：“你没有使一个人转变，是因为你使他沉默了。约翰·莫里。” 同样是在那天晚上，几乎难以辨认地写着：“我正在走下坡路，直到他把我扶起来，但我想得越多，就越觉得我们互相扶持。”
When I did not see him for several days, a letter came. "I have cancelled all public appearancesand speaking engagements for a number of weeks. So within that period it should be possible tofinish this book. With the fast pace of newly developing incidents today, it is easy for somethingthat is done or said tomorrow to be outdated even by sunset on the same day. Malcolm X." 
当我几天没见到他时，一封信来了。"我已经取消了几个星期的所有公开露面和演讲活动。因此，在那段时间里，应该有可能完成这本书。随着今天新出现事件的快速发展，明天所做的或说的某件事甚至可能在同一天日落时过时。马尔科姆·X。"
I pressed to get the first chapter, "Nightmare," into a shape that he could review. When it wasready in a readable rough draft, I telephoned him. He came as quickly as he could drive from hishome-which made me see how grinding an ordeal it was to him to just be sitting at home,inactive, and knowing his temperament, my sympathies went out to Sister Betty. 
我设法把第一章《恶梦》整理成可供他审阅的初稿。当它以可以阅读的草稿形式准备好后，我给他打了电话。他以最快的速度从家里开车过来——这使我看到，对他来说，仅仅坐在家里无所事事就已经是一种痛苦的经历，而了解他的性情后，我对贝蒂修女深感同情。
He pored over the manuscript pages, raptly the first time, then drawing out his red-ink ball-pointpen he read through the chapter again, with the pen occasionally stabbing at something. "Youcan't bless Allah!" he exclaimed, changing "bless" to "praise." In a place that referred to himselfand his brothers and sisters, he scratched red through "we kids." "Kids are goats!" he exclaimedsharply. 
他仔细地阅读着手稿，第一次全神贯注，然后他拿出红色圆珠笔，再次通读那一章，偶尔用笔尖戳一下什么。“你不能祝福真主！”他大声说，把“祝福”改成了“赞美”。在一个提到他自己和他的兄弟姐妹的地方，他用红笔划掉了“我们这些孩子”。“孩子是羊！”他尖声说。
Soon, Malcolm X and his family flew to Miami. Cassius Clay had extended the invitation as a sixthwedding anniversary present to Malcolm X and Sister Betty, and they had accepted mostgratefully. It was Sister Betty's first vacation in the six years of the taut regimen as a Black Muslimwife, and it was for Malcolm X both a saving of face and something to _do_. 
不久,马尔科姆·X和他的家人飞往迈阿密。卡修斯·克莱作为送给马尔科姆·X和贝蒂·西斯特的结婚六周年礼物,邀请他们前往迈阿密,他们欣然接受了邀请。这是贝蒂·西斯特作为黑人穆斯林妻子六年紧张生活中第一次度假,对马尔科姆·X来说,这既挽回了面子,又有了事情可做。
Very soon after his arrival, he telegraphed me his phone number at a motel. I called him and hetold me, "I just want to tell you something. I'm not a betting man anymore, but if you are, you beton Cassius to beat Listen, and you will win." I laughed and said he was prejudiced. He said,"Remember what I told you when the fight's over." I received later a picture postcard, the picturein vivid colors being of a chimpanzee at the Monkey Jungle in Miami. Malcolm X had written onthe reverse side, "One hundred years after the Civil War, and these _chimpanzees_ get morerecognition, respect and freedom in America than our people do. Bro. Malcolm X." Another time,an envelope came, and inside it was a clipping of an Irv Kupcinet column in the Chicago _Sun- Times_. Malcolm X's red pen had encircled an item which read, "Insiders are predicting a split inthe Black Muslims. Malcolm X, ousted as No. 2 man in the organization, may form a splintergroup to oppose Elijah Muhammad." Alongside the item, Malcolm X had scribbled "Imaginethis!!!" 
他一到就发电报给我他在汽车旅馆的电话号码。我打电话给他，他告诉我，“我只是想告诉你一件事。我不再是赌徒了，但如果你是，你赌卡修斯打败利辛顿，你会赢的。”我笑了，说他有偏见。他说，“记住我告诉你的话，当比赛结束的时候。”后来我收到一张明信片，上面的彩色照片是迈阿密猴子丛林里的黑猩猩。马尔科姆·X在背面写道，“内战一百年后，这些黑猩猩在美国得到的承认、尊重和自由比我们的人民多。兄弟马尔科姆·X。”还有一次，一个信封来了，里面是一张芝加哥《太阳报》的剪报。马尔科姆·X的红笔圈出了这样一段话：“圈内人士预测黑人穆斯林会发生分裂。被组织开除的二号人物马尔科姆·X可能会组建一个反对伊利亚·穆罕默德的分裂派。”在这一段话旁边，马尔科姆·X潦草地写下了“想象一下！！！”
The night of the phenomenal upset, when Clay _did_ beat Liston, Malcolm Xtelephoned me, andsounds of excitement were in the background. The victory party was in his motel suite, Malcolm Xtold me. He described what was happening, mentioned some of those who were present, andthat the new heavyweight king was "in the next room, my bedroom here" taking a nap. Afterreminding me of the fight prediction he had made, Malcolm X said that I should look forward nowto Clay's "quick development into a major world figure. I don't know if you really realize the worldsignificance that this is the first _Muslim_ champion." 
那场令人震惊的反败为胜之夜，当克莱击败利斯顿时，马尔科姆·X给我打来电话，背景中充满了兴奋的声音。马尔科姆·X告诉我，胜利派对在他的汽车旅馆套房里举行。他描述了当时发生的事情，提到了一些在场的人，还说新任重量级拳王“就在我隔壁的卧室里打盹儿”。在提醒我他之前对比赛的预测后，马尔科姆·X说，我现在应该期待克莱“迅速发展成为一个举世瞩目的人物。我不知道你是否真的意识到，这是第一位穆斯林冠军，这具有世界意义。”
It was the following morning when Cassius Clay gave the press interview which resulted innational headlines that he was actually a "Black Muslim," and soon after, the newspapers werecarrying pictures of Malcolm X introducing the heavyweight champion to various African diplomatsin the lobbies of the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Malcolm X toured Clay aboutin Harlem, and in other places, functioning, he said, as Clay's "friend and religious advisor." 
正是在第二天早晨，卡修斯·克莱接受了新闻界的采访，结果全国的报纸都登出了他实际上是一个"黑穆斯林"的标题，不久，报纸上就开始刊登马尔科姆·X在纽约联合国总部的大厅里向各种非洲外交官介绍重量级冠军的照片。马尔科姆·X带着克莱在哈莱姆区和其他地方转悠，他说自己是克莱的"朋友和宗教顾问"。
I had now moved upstate to finish my work on the book, and we talked on the telephone everythree or four days. He said things suggesting that he might never be returned to his former BlackMuslim post, and he now began to say things quietly critical of Elijah Muhammad. _Playboy_magazine asked me to do an interview for them with the new champion Cassius Clay, and when Iconfidently asked Malcolm X to arrange for me the needed introduction to Clay, Malcolm Xhesitantly said, "I think you had better ask somebody else to do that." I was highly surprised at thereply, but I had learned never to press him for information. And then, very soon after, I received aletter. "Dear Alex Haley: A quick note. Would you prepare a properly worded letter that wouldenable me to change the reading of the contract so that all remaining proceeds now would go tothe Muslim Mosque, Inc., or in the case of my death then to go directly to my wife, Mrs. Betty XLittle? The sooner this letter or contract is changed, the more easily I will rest." Under thesignature of Malcolm X, therewas a P.S.: "How is it possible to write one's autobiography in aworld so fast-changing as this?" 
为了完成这本书，我现在已经搬到了北部，我们每隔三四天就通一次电话。他说了一些话，暗示他可能再也不会回到他以前的黑人穆斯林岗位了，现在他开始悄悄地批评伊莱贾·穆罕默德。_，《花花公子》_杂志让我为他们做一次对新冠军卡修斯·克莱的采访，当他真诚地要求马尔科姆·X为我安排一次必要的关于克莱的介绍时，马尔科姆·X犹豫地说:“我认为你最好让别人去做那件事。”我对此感到非常惊讶，但我已经学会了永远不要追问他。不久之后，我收到了一封信。亲爱的亚历克斯·哈利：一个简短的说明。你能不能准备一封措辞恰当的信，让我改变对合同的解读，这样所有剩余的收益现在都将交给穆斯林清真寺公司，或者在我死后直接交给我的妻子贝蒂X利特尔夫人？这封信或合同越早更改，我就越容易休息。在马尔科姆·X的签名下，有一条附言：“在这样一个瞬息万变的世界里，怎么可能写自传呢？”
Soon I read in the various newspapers that rumors were being heard of threats on Malcolm X'slife. Then there was an article in the _Amsterdam News_: The caption was "Malcolm X Tells OfDeath Threat," and the story reported that he had said that former close associates of his in theNew York mosque had sent out "a special squad" to "try to kill me in cold blood. Thanks to Allah, Ilearned of the plot from the very same brothers who had been sent out to murder me. Thesebrothers had heard me represent and defend Mr. Muhammad for too long for them to swallow thelies about me without first asking me some questions for their own clarification." 
不久,我在各报上读到有谣传说要谋害马尔科姆·X的生命。后来《阿姆斯特丹新闻》上有一篇文章:标题是“马尔科姆·X谈死亡威胁”。”。文章报道说他声称,他在纽约清真寺的前亲密同僚曾派出“一个特别小组”“企图在我背后冷血地杀死我”。多亏了真主,我从派来暗杀我的那些兄弟那里得知了这个阴谋。这些兄弟已经听我代表穆罕默德先生发言和辩护太久了,以至于他们不能不先向我提出一些问题以求自己弄清楚,就吞下关于我的谎言。
I telephoned Malcolm X, and expressed my personal concern for him. His voice sounded weary.He said that his "uppermost interest" was that any money which might come due him in the futurewould go directly to his new organization, or to his wife, as the letter he had signed and mailedhad specified. He told me, "I know I've got to get a will made for myself, I never did because Inever have had anything to will to anybody, but if I don't have one and something happened tome, there could be a mess." I expressed concern for him, and he told me that he had a loadedrifle in his home, and "I can take care of myself." 
我打电话给马尔科姆·X，向他表示了我个人对他的关心。他的声音听起来很疲惫。他说，他“最关心”的是，将来可能属于他的任何钱都将直接转给他的新组织，或者转给他妻子，正如他签署并邮寄的信中所规定的那样。他告诉我：“我知道我必须为自己立一份遗嘱，我从未这样做过，因为我从未有过任何东西可以留给任何人，但如果我没有遗嘱，如果我发生了什么事，可能会有一团糟。”我表达了对他的关心，他告诉我，他家里有一把上了膛的步枪，“我可以照顾自己。”
The "Muslim Mosque, Inc." to which Malcolm X had referred was a new organization which hehad formed, which at that time consisted of perhaps forty or fifty Muslims who had left theleadership of Elijah Muhammad. 
马尔科姆·X所指的“穆斯林清真寺公司”是他新成立的一个组织，当时该组织由大约40或50名离开埃利亚·穆罕默德领导的穆斯林组成。
Through a close associate of Cassius Clay, whom Malcolm X had finally suggested to me, myinterview appointment was arranged with the heavyweight champion, and I flew down to NewYork City to do the interview for _Playboy_. Malcolm X was "away briefly," Sister Betty said on thephone-and shespoke brusquely. I talked with one Black Muslim lady whom I had known beforeshe had joined, and who had been an admirer of Malcolm X. She had elected to remain in theoriginal fold, "but I'll tell you, brother, what a lot in the mosque are saying, you know, it's like if youdivorced your husband, you'd still like to see him once in a while." During my interviews withCassius Clay in his three-room suite at Harlem's Theresa Hotel, inevitably the questions gotaround to Clay's Muslim membership, then to a query about what had happened to his formerlyvery close relationship with Malcolm X. Evenly, Clay said, "You just don't buck Mr. Muhammadand get away with it. I don't want to talk about him no more." 
通过卡修斯·克莱的密友，马尔科姆·X终于向我推荐了他，我安排了与重量级冠军的采访，并飞往纽约市为《花花公子》做采访。马尔科姆·X“暂时外出”，贝蒂姐妹在电话中说——她说话很生硬。我与一位我以前认识的黑人穆斯林女士交谈，她加入之前就是马尔科姆·X的崇拜者。她选择留在原来的群体中，“但我要告诉你，兄弟，清真寺里的很多人说，你知道，这就像是如果你和你的丈夫离婚了，你还是想偶尔见见他。”在我在哈莱姆区瑟瑟酒店的三居室套房里采访卡修斯·克莱时，不可避免地会问到他的穆斯林身份，然后是关于他与马尔科姆·X曾经非常亲密的关系发生了什么的问题。克莱平静地说：“你不能反抗穆罕默德先生，然后逃脱惩罚。我不想再谈论他了。”
Elijah Muhammad at his headquarters in Chicago grew "emotionally affected" whenever thename of Malcolm X had to be raised in his presence, one of the Muslims in Clay's entourage toldme. Mr. Muhammad reportedly had said, "Brother Malcolm got to be a _big_ man. I made himbig. I was about to make him a _great_ man." The faithful Black Muslims predicted that soonMalcolm X would be turned upon by the defectors from Mosque Number 7 who had joined him:"They will feel betrayed." Said others, "A great chastisement of Allah will fall upon a hypocrite."Mr. Muhammad reportedly had said at another time, "Malcolm is destroying himself," and that hehad no wish whatever to see Malcolm X die, that he "would rather see him live and suffer histreachery." 
伊利莎白穆罕默德在他的芝加哥总部每次听到马尔科姆X的名字时都会“情绪激动”，一位克雷的随从穆斯林告诉我。据说穆罕默德曾说：“马尔科姆兄弟成了一个大人物。我使他成了大人物。我本打算使他成为一个伟大的人物。” 忠诚的黑人穆斯林预言，马尔科姆X很快就会被从7号清真寺投奔他的叛徒们背叛：“他们会感到被背叛。”其他人说：“真主将对伪君子进行严厉的惩罚。”据说穆罕默德在另一个时候说：“马尔科姆正在毁灭自己。”他不希望看到马尔科姆X死去，他“宁愿看到他活着并承受他的背叛”。
The general feeling among Harlemites, non-Muslims, with whom I talked was that Malcolm X hadbeen powerful and influential enough a minister that eventually he would split the mosquemembership into two hostile camps, and that in New York City at least, Elijah Muhammad'sunquestioned rule would be ended. 
我跟非穆斯林的哈莱姆人交谈时，普遍的感觉是马尔科姆·X作为一个部长已经足够强大和有影响力，最后他会把清真寺的成员分裂成两个敌对的阵营，至少在纽约市，伊利亚·穆罕默德的绝对统治就会结束。
Malcolm X returned. He said that he had been in Boston and Philadelphia. He spent ample timewith me, now during the day, in Room 1936 in the HotelAmericana. His old total ease was nolonger with him. As if it was the most natural thing in the world to do, at sudden intervals he wouldstride to the door; pulling it open, he would look up and down the corridor, then shut the dooragain. "If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle," he said by way of explanation."I'm not saying it distressingly-" He leaned forward and touched the buff gold bedspread. "I'msaying it like I say that's a bedspread." 
马尔科姆·X回来了。他说他在波士顿和费城。他花了很多时间和我在一起，现在在白天，在美洲酒店1936房间。他以前那种完全的自在已经不再有了。就像做世界上最自然的事情一样，他会在突然的间隔中走向门口；打开门，他会向上和向下看走廊，然后再次关上门。“如果这本书出版时我还活着，那将是一个奇迹，”他以此作为解释。“我不是说它令人痛苦——”他向前倾，触摸了米色金床单。“我是说它就像我说那是一床床单。”
For the first time he talked with me in some detail about what had happened. He said that hisstatement about President Kennedy's assassination was not why he had been ousted from theMuslims. "It wasn't the reason at all. Nobody said anything when I made stronger statementsbefore." The real reason, he said, was "jealousy in Chicago, and I had objected to the immoralityof the man who professed to be more moral than anybody." 
他第一次详细地跟我谈起了发生的事。他说他关于肯尼迪总统被暗杀的声明并不是他被穆斯林驱逐的原因。“那根本不是原因。我以前发表过更强烈的声明，那时也没人说什么。”他说真正的原因是“芝加哥的嫉妒心，我反对那个自诩比任何人都道德的人的不道德行为。”
Malcolm X said that he had increased the Nation of Islam membership from about 400 when hehad joined to around 40,000. "I don't think there were more than 400 in the country when I joined,I really don't. They were mostly older people, and many of them couldn't even pronounce Mr.Muhammad's name, and he stayed mostly in the background." 
马尔科姆·X说，他使伊斯兰教徒的人数从他加入时的大约400人增加到约4万人。“我想全国加入伊斯兰教的人数不超过400人，我真的不知道。他们大多是老年人，许多人甚至不会念穆罕默德先生的名字，他总是躲在幕后。”
Malcolm X worked hard not to show it, but he was upset. "There is nothing more frightful thanignorance in action. Goethe," he scribbled one day. He hinted about Cassius Clay a couple oftimes, and when I responded only with anecdotes about my interview with Clay, he finally askedwhat Clay had said of him. I dug out the index card on which the question was typed in advanceand Clay's response was beneath in longhand. Malcolm X stared at the card, then out of thewindow, and he got up and walked around; one of the few times I ever heard his voice betray hishurt was when he said, "I felt like a blood big-brother to him." He paused. "I'm not against himnow. He's a fine young man. Smart. He's just let himself be used, led astray." 
马尔科姆·X努力不表露出来，但他很生气。“行动中的无知是最可怕的。”他有一天写道。“歌德。”他几次暗示了克利，当我只用关于我和克利的访谈的轶事回应时，他最后问克利对他的看法。我找出事先打印在卡片上的问题，克利的回答以手写体写在下面。马尔科姆·X盯着卡片，然后看向窗外，他站起来四处走动；这是我唯一一次听到他的声音泄露了他的痛苦，他说：“我觉得他是我的亲兄弟。”他停顿了一下。“我现在不反对他。他是个优秀的年轻人。聪明。他只是让自己被利用，被误导。”
 And at another time there in the hotel room he came the nearest to tears that I ever saw him, andalso the only time I ever heard him use, for his race, one word. He had been talking about howhard he had worked building up the Muslim organization in the early days when he was firstmoved to New York City, when abruptly he exclaimed hoarsely, "We had the _best_ organizationthe black man's ever had-_niggers_ ruined it!" 
在那家旅馆的房间里，他曾经有一次最接近流泪，那是我所见过的，也是我唯一一次听见他用一个词来描述他的种族。他一直在谈论他早期在刚搬到纽约市时，为了建立穆斯林组织而付出的艰辛努力，突然他沙哑地喊道：“我们曾经有过黑人有过的最好的组织——黑鬼把它搞砸了！”
A few days later, however, he wrote in one of his memo books this, which he let me read,"Children have a lesson adults should learn, to not be ashamed of failing, but to get up and tryagain. Most of us adults are so afraid, so cautious, so 'safe,' and therefore so shrinking and rigidand afraid that it is why so many humans fail. Most middle-aged adults have resigned themselvesto failure."Telephone calls came frequently for Malcolm X when he was in the room with me, or he wouldmake calls; he would talk in a covert, guarded manner, clearly not wishing me to be able to followthe discussion. I took to going into the bathroom at these times, and closing the door, emergingwhen the murmuring of his voice had stopped-hoping that made him more comfortable. Later, hewould tell me that he was hearing from some Muslims who were still ostensibly ElijahMuhammad's followers. "I'm a marked man," he said one day, after such a call. "I've had highlyplaced people tell me to be very careful every move I make." He thought about it. "Just as long asmy family doesn't get hurt, I'm not frightened for myself." I have the impression that Malcolm Xheard in advance that the Muslim organization was going to sue to make him vacate the home heand his family lived in. 
然而几天后，他在他的备忘录中写道，让我读了这句话：“孩子们有一课成年人应该学习，那就是不要为失败感到羞耻，而是站起来再试一次。我们大多数成年人都如此害怕，如此谨慎，如此“安全”，因此如此萎缩和僵化，如此害怕，这就是为什么这么多人类失败的原因。大多数中年成年人都已经向失败妥协。”当我和Malcolm X在一起时，电话经常会打来，或者他会打电话；他会以一种秘密、谨慎的方式交谈，显然不希望我能理解讨论的内容。我开始在这些时候去浴室，关上门，当他的低语声停止时再出来——希望这让他感觉更舒服。后来，他会告诉我，他正在听取一些仍然表面上是Elijah Muhammad的追随者的穆斯林的意见。“我是一个被标记的人，”有一天，他打完这样的电话后说。“我已经有一些地位很高的人告诉我，我每走一步都要非常小心。”他想了想。“只要我的家人不受伤害，我就不会为自己感到害怕。”我有一种印象，Malcolm X提前听说穆斯林组织将起诉让他搬出他和他的家人居住的家。
I had become worried that Malcolm X, bitter, would want to go back through the chapters in whichhe had told of his Black Muslim days and re-edit them in some way. The day before I left NewYork City to return upstate, I raised my concern to Malcolm X. "I have thought about that," hesaid. "There are a lot ofthings I could say that passed through my mind at times even then, thingsI saw and heard, but I threw them out of my mind. I'm going to let it stand the way I've told it. Iwant the book to be the way it was." 
我开始担心马尔科姆·X会因为心怀怨恨而想重读他描述自己在黑人穆斯林中的日子的章节，并以某种方式重新编辑它们。在我离开纽约市返回州府的前一天，我把我的担忧告诉了马尔科姆·X。“我已经考虑过了，”他说，“有些时候我甚至想过的一些事情，我看到和听到的事情，但我把它们从我的脑海中抛出。我要让它保持我告诉它的样子。我希望这本书保持它本来的样子。”
Then-March 26, 1964-a note came from Malcolm X: "There is a chance that I may make a quicktrip to several very important countries in Africa, including a pilgrimage to the Muslim Holy Citiesof Mecca and Medina, beginning about April 13th. Keep this to yourself." 
1964年3月26日，马尔科姆·X寄来一张便条：“我可能在4月13日左右开始，去包括麦加和麦地那在内的非洲几个非常重要的国家进行一次朝圣之旅。这件事你不要告诉任何人。”
While abroad, Malcolm X wrote letters and postcards to almost everyone he knew well. His lettersnow were signed "El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz." 
在国外期间，马尔科姆·X给几乎他认识的所有人写了信和明信片。他的信现在都签名为“El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz”。
Then, in mid-May, Sister Betty telephoned me, her voice jubilant: Malcolm X was returning. I flewto New York City. On May 2 1, the phone rang in my hotel room and Sister Betty said, "Just aminute, please-," then the deep voice said, "How are you?" 
然后，在五月中旬，贝蒂修女打电话给我，声音里充满了喜悦：马尔科姆·X要回来了。我飞往纽约。5月21日，我旅馆房间的电话响了，贝蒂修女说：“请稍等一下——”然后那个低沉的声音说：“你好吗？”
"Well! El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz! How are _you_?" He said, "Just a little bit tired." He had arrivedon a Pan-American Airlines flight at 4:30. He was going to have a press conference at seven P.M.at the Hotel Theresa. "I'll pick you up at 6:30 at 135th and Lenox, on the uptown side-all right?" 
"哈罗!马利克·夏巴兹!你好吗?"他说,"只是有点累."他乘泛美航空公司班机于四点半到达.他将在晚上七点在瑟瑟酒店举行记者招待会."我六点半在135号和伦诺克斯大街的上城街口等你."
When the blue Oldsmobile stopped, and I got in, El-Hajj Malcolm, broadly beaming, wore aseersucker suit, the red hair needed a barber's attention, and he had grown a beard. Also in thecar was Sister Betty. It was the first time we had ever seen each other after more than a year oftalking several times a week on the telephone. We smiled at each other. She wore dark glasses,a blue maternity suit, and she was pregnant with what would be her fourth child. 
当蓝色的奥尔兹莫比尔停下来，我上车的时候，满脸笑容的埃尔-哈吉·马尔科姆穿着亚麻西装，红色的头发需要理发师的注意，他蓄起了胡子。车里还有贝蒂修女。这是我们一年多来第一次见面，之前我们每周都会通过电话交谈几次。我们互相微笑。她戴着墨镜，穿着蓝色孕妇装，怀上了她的第四个孩子。
There must have been fifty still and television photographers and reporters jockey ing for position,up front, and the rest of the Skyline Ballroom was filling with Negro followers of Malcolm X, or hiswell-wishers, and the curious. The room lit up with flickering and flooding lights as he came in thedoor squiring Sister Betty, holding her arm tenderly, and she was smiling broadly in her pride thatthis man was her man. I recognized the _Times _'M.S. Handler and introduced myself; we warmlyshook hands and commandeered a little two-chair table. The reporters in a thick semicircle beforeMalcolm X seated on the podium fired questions at him, and he gave the impression that all of histwelve years' oratorical practice had prepared him for this new image. 
至少有五十名静止和电视摄影师和记者为了抢占有利位置，挤在前面，而天空线舞厅的其他地方则挤满了马尔科姆·X的黑人追随者，或者他的祝福者和好奇者。当他带着妹妹贝蒂走进门，温柔地挽着她的手臂，房间里的灯光闪烁着，洪水般的灯光照亮了房间，她自豪地微笑着，因为这个男人是她的男人。我认出了《纽约时报》的M.S. Handler，并自我介绍，我们热情地握手，并抢占了一个有两个座位的小桌子。马尔科姆·X坐在讲台上，记者们围成一个厚厚的半圆，向他提问，他给人的印象是，他十二年来的演说练习使他为这个新形象做好了准备。
"Do we correctly understand that you now do not think that all whites are evil?" 
"我们是否正确理解你现在并不认为所有白人都是邪恶的?"
"_True_, sir! My trip to Mecca has opened my eyes. I no longer subscribe to racism. I haveadjusted my thinking to the point where I believe that whites are human beings"-a significantpause-"as long as this is borne out by their humane attitude toward Negroes." 
"真的,先生! 我去麦加的旅行开阔了我的眼界。我不再相信种族主义。我已经调整了我的思维方式，以至于我相信白人是人类——有一个显著的停顿——只要他们对黑人的态度是人道的。"
They picked at his "racist" image. "I'm _not_ a racist.  I'm not condemning whites for being whites,but for their deeds. I condemn what whites collectively have done to our people collectively." 
他们攻击他的“种族主义者”形象。“我不是种族主义者。我不是谴责白人因为他是白人，而是谴责他们的行为。我谴责白人集体对我们集体人民所做的事。”
He almost continually flashed about the room the ingratiating boyish smile. He would pick at thenew reddish beard. They asked him about that, did he plan to keep it? He said he hadn't decidedyet, he would have to see if he could get used to it or not. Was he maneuvering to now join t hemajor civil rights leaders whom he had previously bitterly attacked? He answered that onesideways: "I'll explain it this way, sir. If some men are in a car, driving with a destination in mind,and you know they are going the wrong way, but they are convinced they are going the right way,then you get into the car with them, and ride with them, talking-and finally when they see they areon the wrong road, not getting where they were intending, then you tell them, and they will listentoyou _then_, what road to take." He had never been in better form, weighing, parrying,answering the questions. 
他几乎不断地在房间里闪烁着讨人喜欢的少年微笑。他会拨弄新长的红褐色胡须。他们问他关于这个，他是否打算留着？他说他还没有决定，他得看看自己是否能习惯。他是否正在设法加入他以前猛烈攻击的主要民权领袖？他从侧面回答：“我这样解释吧，先生。如果一些人在一辆车里，带着目的地开车，你知道他们走错了路，但他们坚信自己走对了路，那么你就和他们一起上车，和他们一起聊天，最后当他们看到自己在错误的路上，没有到达他们打算去的地方，然后你告诉他们，他们会听你的，那时你应该告诉他们该走哪条路。”他从未如此出色，权衡、挡开、回答问题。
The _Times_' Handler, beside me, was taking notes and muttering under his breath, "Incredible!Incredible!" I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking, some of the time, that if a pebble weredropped from the window behind Malcolm X, it would have struck on a sidewalk eight floors belowwhere years before he had skulked, selling dope. 
我旁边的《泰晤士报》记者正在做笔记，嘴里念念有词：“难以置信！难以置信！”我当时也在想同样的事情。我有时在想，如果从马尔科姆·X身后的窗户扔出一块石头，它会落在八层楼下的人行道上，而就在几年前，他曾鬼鬼祟祟地在那儿卖毒品。
As I resumed writing upstate, periodic notes came from Malcolm X. "I hope the book isproceeding rapidly, for events concerning my life happen so swiftly, much of what has alreadybeen written can easily be outdated from month to month. In life, nothing is permanent; not evenlife itself (smile). So I would advise you to rush it on out as fast as possible." Another note, specialdelivery, had a tone of irritation with me: he had received from the publisher a letter whichindicated that he had received a $2500 check when the book contract was signed, "and thereforeI will be expected to pay _personal_ income tax on this. As you know, it was my repeatedspecification that this entire transaction was to be made at that time directly with and to theMosque. In fact, I have never seen that check to this very day." 
当我回到北方写作时，不断收到马尔科姆·X的来信。“我希望这本书进展顺利，因为关于我生活的事件发生得如此迅速，以至于从一个月到下一个月，已经写下的许多内容很容易过时。生活中没有什么是永恒的，甚至生命本身也不例外（微笑）。因此，我建议你尽快完成它。”另一封特快专递信的语气中对我有些不满：他从出版商那里收到一封信，信中说他在签订书约时收到了2500美元的支票，“因此我将被期望为此支付个人所得税。如你所知，我一直反复强调，整个交易应直接与清真寺进行。”事实上，直到今天我还没有看到那张支票。”
The matter was straightened out, and I sent Malcolm X some rough chapters to read. I wasappalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of hisalmost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm X, I remindedhim of his previous decision, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing toreaders of what would lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of itsbuilding suspense and drama. Malcolm X said, gruffly, "Whose book is this?" I told him "yours, ofcourse," and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. He said that he would haveto think about it. I was heart-sick at the prospect that he might want to re-edit the entire book intoapolemic against Elijah Muhammad. But late that night, Malcolm X telephoned. "I'm sorry. You'reright. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already hadstand." I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I wouldcovertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in whathe had originally said. And the only thing that he ever indicated that he wished had been differentin his life came when he was reading the chapter "Laura." He said, "That was a smart girl, a_good_ girl. She tried her best to make something out of me, and look what I started her into- dope and prostitution. I wrecked that girl." 
事情得到了解决，我给马尔科姆·X寄了一些粗略的章节让他阅读。当我看到他很快就把它们还回来，上面有很多地方都被他用红墨水改过，他在这些地方描述了他和伊利亚·穆罕默德之间近乎父子般的关系时，我感到非常震惊。我打电话给马尔科姆·X，提醒他他之前所做的决定，并强调如果这些章节包含了这样一些对读者的暗示，那么这本书就会自动失去一些悬念和戏剧性。马尔科姆·X粗鲁地说：“这是谁的书？”我告诉他：“当然是你的，我只是以作家的身份提出这个反对意见。”他说他需要考虑一下。我为他可能想要重新编辑整本书，使其成为反对伊利亚·穆罕默德的论战而感到心痛。但那天晚上很晚的时候，马尔科姆·X打电话来了。“对不起，你是对的。我因为某件事而感到不安。忘记我想要改变什么，让你已经写好的东西保持原样。”除非我和他在一起，否则我再也没有给他章节让他审查。我曾经多次偷偷地看到他皱着眉头，痛苦地皱着眉头，因为他正在阅读，但他再也没有要求他对他说过的话做出任何改变。他唯一表示他希望他的生活中有所不同的事情，就是当他阅读“劳拉”一章时。他说：“那是一个聪明的女孩，一个好女孩。她尽力让我变得更好，看看我让她陷入了什么——毒品和卖淫。我毁了那个女孩。”

Malcolm X was busy, busy, busy; he could not visit my hotel room often, and when he did, itshortly would get the feeling of Grand Central Station. It seemed that when the telephone was notringing for him, he was calling someone else, consulting the jotted numbers in his ever-readymemorandum book. Now he had begun to talk a great deal with various people from the MiddleEast or Africa who were in New York. Some of these came to see him at the hotel room. At first, Iwould sit by the window engrossed in reading while they talked by the room's door in low tones.He was very apologetic when this occurred, and I told him I felt no sensitivity about it; then,afterwards, I would generally step out into the hallway, or perhaps take the elevator down to thelobby, then watch the elevators until I saw the visitor leave. One day, I remember, the phone hadrung steadily with such callers as C.B.S., A.B.C., N.B.C., every New York City paper, the London_Daily Express_, and numerous individuals-he and I had gotten no work at all accomplished; thena television camera crew arrived and filled the room to tape an interview with Malcolm X byA.B.C.'s commentator Bill Beutel. As the crew was setting up its floodlights on tripods, a Dayton,Ohio, radio station called, wishing to interview Malcolm X by telephone. He asked me to ask themto call him the following day at his sister Ella's home in Boston. Then the Ghana Ministry ofInformation called. I turned with a note to Malcolm X to whom the commentator Beutel had justsaid, "I won't take much of your time, I just have a few probably stupid questions." Glancing at mynote, Malcolm X said to Beutel, "Only the unasked question is stupid," and then to me, "Tell themI'll call them back, please." Then just as the television cameras began rolling, with Beutel andMalcolm X talking, the telephone rang again and it was _Life_ magazine reporter Marc Crawfordto whom I whispered what was happening. Crawford, undaunted, asked if the open receiver couldbe placed where he could hear the interview, and I complied, relieved that it was one way to letthe interview proceed without interruption. 
马尔科姆·X非常忙碌，他不能经常来我的酒店房间，而当他来的时候，房间很快就变得像大中央车站一样热闹。似乎当电话没有响的时候，他就在给其他人打电话，查阅他那本随时准备好的备忘录。现在他开始和纽约的许多来自中东或非洲的人交谈。他们中的一些人会到酒店房间来看他。起初，我会坐在窗边专心阅读，而他们则在房间门口低声交谈。当他发生这种情况时，他会非常抱歉，我告诉他我对此没有任何敏感性；然后，之后，我通常会走到走廊里，或者也许乘电梯下到大堂，然后看着电梯直到我看到访客离开。我记得有一天，电话不断响起，有哥伦比亚广播公司、美国广播公司、全国广播公司、纽约市的每一家报纸、伦敦《每日快报》以及许多个人——我和马尔科姆·X一点工作都没有完成；然后一个电视摄像机组到达并把房间填满，以录制由美国广播公司评论员比尔·布特尔对马尔科姆·X的采访。当摄像机组在三脚架上设置他们的聚光灯时，俄亥俄州代顿的一家电台打电话来，希望通过电话采访马尔科姆·X。他让我告诉他们第二天打电话到他姐姐艾拉在波士顿的家。然后加纳信息部打电话来。我转向马尔科姆·X，手里拿着一张纸，上面写着评论员比尔·布特尔刚刚说的：“我不会占用你太多时间，我只有几个可能愚蠢的问题。”马尔科姆·X瞥了一眼我的纸条，对布特尔说：“只有未问的问题才是愚蠢的，”然后对我说：“请告诉他们我会回电话。”就在电视摄像机开始滚动，布特尔和马尔科姆·X交谈的时候，电话又响了，是《生活》杂志的记者马克·克劳福德，我小声告诉他发生了什么。克劳福德毫不气馁，问是否可以将打开的听筒放在他可以听到采访的地方，我同意了，松了一口气，因为这是让采访不受干扰地进行的一种方式。
The manuscript copy which Malcolm X was given to review was in better shape now, and hepored through page by page, intently, and now and then his head would raise with somecomment. "You know," he said once, "why I have been able to have some effect is because Imake a study of the weaknesses of this country and because the more the white man yelps, themore I know I have struck a nerve." Another time, he put down upon the bed the manuscript hewas reading, and he got up from his chair and walked back and forth, stroking his chin, then helooked at me. "You know this place here in this chapter where I told you how I put the pistol up tomy head and kept pulling the trigger and scared them so when I was starting the burglary ring- well," he paused, "I don't know if I ought to tell you this or not, but I want to tell the truth." He eyedme, speculatively. "I palmed the bullet." We laughed together. I said, "Okay, give that page here,I'll fix it." Then he considered, "No, leave it that way. Too many people would be so quick to saythat's what I'm doing today, bluffing." 
马尔科姆X拿到的那份手稿现在状况好多了，他一页一页仔细地翻阅，不时地抬起头发表评论。“你知道，”他有一次说，“我之所以能产生一些影响，是因为我研究了这个国家的弱点，而且白人叫喊得越厉害，我就越知道我击中了他们的要害。”又有一次，他把正在读的手稿放在床上，从椅子上站起来，在房间里来回走动，摸着下巴，然后看着我。“你知道，在这一章里，我告诉你我是如何把枪口对准我的头，不停地扣动扳机，把他们吓得半死，当我开始从事盗窃团伙时——嗯，”他停顿了一下，“我不知道我是否应该告诉你这件事，但我想要说实话。”他好奇地看着我。“我把子弹藏在手里。”我们一起笑了。“好吧，给我这一页，我会修改的。”然后他考虑了一下，“不，就这样吧。太多人会很快说这就是我今天在做的事情，虚张声势。”
Again when reading about the period when he had discovered the prison library, Malcolm X'shead jerked  up. "Boy! I never will forget that old aardvark!" The next evening, he came into theroom and told me that he had beento the Museum of Natural History and learned somethingabout the aardvark. "Now, aardvark actually means 'earth hog.' That's a good example of rootwords, as I was telling you. When you study the science of philology, you learn the lawsgoverning how a consonant can lose its shape, but it keeps its identity from language tolanguage." What astonished me here was that I knew that on that day, Malcolm X's schedule hadbeen crushing, involving both a television and radio appearance and a live speech, yet he hadgone to find out something about the aardvark. 
当他读到发现自己图书馆的那段时期时，马尔科姆X的头突然抬了起来。“天哪！我永远都不会忘记那只老树懒！”第二天晚上，他走进房间告诉我他去了自然历史博物馆，并且了解了一些关于树懒的事情。“现在，树懒实际上意味着‘土猪’。这就是我告诉你的词根词的例子。当你学习语言学这门科学时，你会了解到支配辅音如何在语言中保持其身份的规律，尽管它们的形状可能会改变。”这里让我惊讶的是，我知道那天马尔科姆X的日程安排非常紧张，包括一次电视和广播露面以及一次现场演讲，但他还是去寻找了一些关于树懒的信息。
Before long, Malcolm X called a press conference, and announced, "My new Organization ofAfro-American Unity is a non-religious and non-sectarian group organized to unite Afro- Americans for a constructive program toward attainment of human rights." The new OAAU's toneappeared to be one of militant black nationalism. He said to the questions of various reporters insubsequent interviews that the OAAU would seek to convert the Negro population from non- violence to active self-defense against white supremacists across America. On the subject ofpolitics he offered an enigma, "Whether you use bullets or ballots, you've got to aim well; don'tstrike at the puppet, strike at the puppeteer." Did he envision any special area of activity? "I'mgoing to join in the fight wherever Negroes ask for my help." What about alliance with other Negroorganizations? He said that he would consider forming some united front with certain selectedNegro leaders. He conceded under questioning that the N.A.A.C.P. was "doing some good."Could any whites join his OAAU? " If John Brown were alive, maybe him." And he answered hiscritics with such statements as that he would send "armed guerrillas" into Mississippi. "I am deadserious. We will send them not only to Mississippi, but to any place where black people's lives arethreatened by white bigots. As far as I am concerned, Mississippi is anywhere south of theCanadian border." At another time, when Evelyn Cunningham of the _Pittsburgh Courier_ askedMalcolm X in a kidding way, "Say something startling for my column," he told her, "Anyone whowants to follow me and my movement has got to be ready to goto jail, to the hospital, and to thecemetery before he can be truly free." Evelyn Cunningham, printing the item, commented, "Hesmiled and chuckled, but he was in dead earnest." 
不久，马尔科姆·X召开记者招待会，宣布：“我的新非洲裔美国人团结组织是一个非宗教、非宗派的组织，旨在团结非洲裔美国人，为实现人权制定建设性的计划。”新OAAU的语气似乎是激进的黑人民族主义。他在随后的采访中对各种记者的问题说，OAAU将寻求将非暴力的黑人人口转变为对美国各地白人至上主义者采取积极自卫。在政治问题上，他提出了一个谜语：“无论你使用子弹还是选票，你都必须瞄准好；不要打木偶，要打木偶师。”他设想了任何特殊的活动领域吗？“无论黑人要求我帮助哪里，我都会加入战斗。”与其他黑人组织结盟呢？他说，他考虑与某些选定的黑人领导人组成联合阵线。他承认，在质疑下，N.A.A.C.P.“正在做一些好事。” 白人可以加入他的OAAU吗？“如果约翰·布朗还活着，也许他。”他用这样的陈述回答他的批评者，说他会派“武装游击队员”进入密西西比州。“我是认真的。我们不仅会把他们送到密西西比州，而且会把他们送到任何黑人的生命受到白人种族主义者威胁的地方。就我而言，密西西比州是加拿大边境以南的任何地方。”有一次，当《匹兹堡邮报》的伊芙琳·坎宁安开玩笑地问马尔科姆·X：“为我的专栏说点惊人的话吧”，他告诉她：“任何想跟随我及其运动的人都必须准备好在真正自由之前去坐牢、去医院和去墓地。”伊芙琳·坎宁安在报道这一事件时评论说：“他微笑着，咯咯地笑着，但他非常认真。”
His fourth child, yet another daughter, was born and he and Sister Betty named the baby GamilahLumumbah. A young waitress named Helen Lanier, at Harlem's Twenty Two Club where MalcolmX now often asked people to meet him, gave him a layette for the new baby. He was very deeplytouched by the gesture. "Why, I hardly know that girl!" 
他的第四个孩子,又是一个女儿,出生了,他和贝蒂姐妹给孩子取名为Gamilah Lumumbah。一个名叫海伦·兰尼尔的年轻女招待,在哈莱姆的二十一家俱乐部,现在马尔科姆X经常让人们在那里与他会面,她给新生婴儿送去了襁褓。他对这一举动非常感动。“天哪,我几乎不认识那个女孩!”
He was clearly irked when a _New York Times_ poll among New York City Negroes reflected thatthree-fourths had named Dr. Martin Luther King as "doing the best work for Negroes," andanother one-fifth had voted for the N.A.A.C.P.'s Roy Wilkins, while only six per cent had voted forMalcolm X. "Brother," he said to me, "do you realize that some of history's greatest leaders neverwere recognized until they were safely in the ground!" 
他显然对《纽约时报》的一项调查感到不悦，该调查显示，纽约市的黑人中有四分之三的人认为马丁·路德·金“为黑人做得最好”，另外五分之一的人投票给全国有色人种协进会的罗伊·威尔金斯，而只有百分之六的人投票给马尔科姆·X。“兄弟，”他对我这样说，“你意识到历史上一些最伟大的领袖在他们入土为安之前从未得到过认可吗？”
One morning in mid-summer  1964, Malcolm X telephoned me and said that he would be leaving"within the next two or three days" for a planned six weeks abroad. I heard from him first in Cairo,about as the predicted "long, hot summer" began in earnest, with riots and other uprisings ofNegroes occurring in suburban Philadelphia, in Rochester, in Brooklyn, in Harlem, and othercities. The _New York Times_ reported that a meeting of Negro intellectuals had agreed that Dr.Martin Luther King could secure the allegiance of the middle and upper classes of Negroes, butMalcolm X alone could secure the allegiance of Negroes at the bottom. "The Negroes respect Dr.King and Malcolm X because they sense in these men absolute integrity and know they will neversell them out. Malcolm X cannot be corrupted and the Negroes know this and therefore respecthim. They also know that he comes from the lower depths, as they do, and regard him as one oftheir own. Malcolm X is going to play a formidable role, because the racial struggle has nowshifted to the urban North . . .if Dr. King is convinced that he has sacrificed ten years of brilliantleadership, he will be forced to revise his concepts. There is only one direction in which he canmove, and that is in the direction of Malcolm X." I sent a clipping of that story to Malcolm X inCairo. 
1964年夏天的一个早晨，马尔科姆·X打电话给我，说他将在接下来的两三天内出国，计划在国外待六周。我第一次从开罗听到他的消息，就在夏天开始变得炎热的时候，郊区费城、罗切斯特、布鲁克林、哈莱姆和其他城市的骚乱和其他黑人起义开始发生。《纽约时报》报道说，一次黑人知识分子会议一致认为，马丁·路德·金博士可以赢得中上层黑人的忠诚，但只有马尔科姆·X可以赢得底层黑人的忠诚。“黑人尊重马丁·路德·金博士和马尔科姆·X，因为他们感到这些人的绝对正直，并知道他们永远不会背叛他们。马尔科姆·X不能被腐蚀，黑人知道这一点，因此尊重他。他们也知道他来自底层，就像他们一样，因此把他视为自己人。马尔科姆·X将发挥重要作用，因为种族斗争现在已经转移到了北部的城市……如果马丁·路德·金博士确信他已经牺牲了十年的卓越领导，他将被迫修正他的观念。他只能朝一个方向前进，那就是马尔科姆·X的方向。”我把那篇报道的剪报寄给了开罗的马尔科姆·X。
In Washington, D.C. and New York City, at least, powerful civic, private, and governmentalagencies and individuals were keenly interested in what Malcolm X was saying abroad, and werespeculating upon what would he say, and possibly do, when he returned to America. In upstateNew York, I received a telephone call from a close friend who said he had been asked to ask meif I would come to New York City on an appointed day to meet with "a very high governmentofficial" who was interested in Malcolm X. I did fly down to the city. My friend accompanied me tothe offices of a large private foundation well known for its activities and donations in the civil- rights area. I met the foundation's president and he introduced me to the Justice Department CivilRights Section head, Burke Marshall. Marshall was chiefly interested in Malcolm X's finances,particularly how his extensive traveling since his Black Muslim ouster had been paid for. I told himthat to the best of my knowledge the several payments from the publisher had financed MalcolmX, along with fees he received for some speeches, and possible donations that his organizationreceived, and that Malcolm X had told me of borrowing money from his Sister Ella for the currenttrip, and that recently the _Saturday Evening Post_ had bought the condensation rights of thebook for a substantial sum that was soon to be received. Marshall listened quietly, intently, andasked a few questions concerning other aspects of 
在华盛顿特区和纽约市，至少有强大的公民、私人和政府机构以及个人对马尔科姆·X在国外说的话非常感兴趣，并在猜测他回到美国时会说什么，甚至可能做什么。在纽约州，我接到了一个亲密朋友的电话，他说他被要求问我是否会在指定的一天飞到纽约市，去见一位对马尔科姆·X感兴趣的“政府高官”。我确实飞到了这座城市。我的朋友陪我去了一个大型私人基金会的办公室，这个基金会以其在民权领域的活动和捐款而闻名。我见到了基金会的主席，他把我介绍给了司法部民权司司长伯克·马歇尔。马歇尔主要对马尔科姆·X的财务感兴趣，特别是他自被黑人穆斯林驱逐以来的广泛旅行是如何支付的。我告诉他，据我所知，出版商的几次付款为马尔科姆·X提供了资金，以及他收到的一些演讲费，以及他的组织可能收到的捐款，马尔科姆·X告诉我他从他的姐姐埃拉那里借了钱来支付这次旅行，最近《周六晚间邮报》以一大笔钱购买了这本书的浓缩权，这笔钱很快就会收到。马歇尔静静地、专心地听着，问了一些关于这本书其他方面的
Malcolm X's life, then thanked me. I wrote to Malcolm X in Cairo that night about the interview. Henever mentioned it. 
马尔科姆·X的生活，然后感谢了我。那天晚上我在开罗给马尔科姆·X写了关于采访的信。他从未提及此事。
The _Saturday Evening Post_ flew photographer John Launois to Cairo to locate Malcolm X andphotograph him in color. The magazine's September 12issue appeared, and I sent a copy byairmail to Malcolm X. Within a few days, I received a stinging note, expressing his anger at themagazine's editorial regarding his life story. (The editorial's opening sentence read, "If Malcolm Xwere not a Negro, his autobiography would be little more than a journal of abnormal psychology,the story of a burglar, dope pusher, addict and jailbird-with a family history of insanity-whoacquires messianic delusions and sets forth to preach an upside-down religion of 'brotherly'hatred.") I wrote to Malcolm X that he could not fairly hold me responsible for what the magazinehad written in a separate editorial opinion. He wrote an apology, "but the greatest care must beexercised in the future." 
《周六晚邮报》派摄影师约翰·劳诺斯飞往开罗寻找马尔科姆·X并为他拍摄彩色照片。该杂志9月12日的期出现了，我通过航空邮件把一份复印件寄给了马尔科姆·X。几天后，我收到了一封尖刻的信，信中表达了他对该杂志关于他生平故事的社论的愤怒（社论的开篇写道：“如果马尔科姆·X不是黑人，他的自传只不过是一个异常心理学的日记，讲述的是一个窃贼、毒品贩子、瘾君子和坐牢者的故事——他的家族有精神病史——他获得了救世主妄想症，并开始传教一种‘兄弟般的’仇恨的倒置的宗教。”）我写信给马尔科姆·X，告诉他他不能公平地怪罪我在另一篇社论观点中写的东西。他写了一封道歉信，“但未来必须格外小心。”
His return from Africa was even more auspicious than when he had returned from the Hajjpilgrimage to Mecca. A large group of Negroes, his followers and well-wishers, kept gathering inthe Overseas Arrival Building at Kennedy Airport. When I entered, white men with cameras werepositioned on the second level, taking pictures of all the Negroes who entered, and almost asobvious were Negro plain-clothesmen moving about. Malcolm's greeters had draped across theglass overlooking the U.S. Customs Inspection line some large cloth banners on which werepainted in bold letters, "Welcome Home, Malcolm." 
他从非洲回来的景象比他从麦加朝圣回来时还要好。一大群黑人，他的追随者和祝福者，聚集在肯尼迪机场的海外抵达大楼。当我进去时，带着相机的白人站在二楼，给每一个进来的人拍照，几乎同样显眼的是四处走动的便衣黑人。马尔科姆的迎接者在俯瞰美国海关检查线的玻璃上挂了一些大的布横幅，上面用粗体字写着“欢迎回家，马尔科姆”。
He came in sight, stepping into one of the Customs Inspection lines; he heard the cheering andhe looked up, smiling his pleasure. 
他出现在视线中，走进了海关检查的一条队伍；他听到了欢呼声，抬起头，露出了愉快的笑容。

Malcolm X wanted to "huddle" with me to fill me in on details from his trip that he wanted in thebook. He said that he was giving me only the highlights, because he felt that his carefully keptdiary might be turned into another book. We had intensive sessions in my hotel room, where heread what he selected from the diary, and I took notes. "What I want to stress is that I was tryingto internationalize our problem," he said to me, "to make the Africans feel their_kinship_ with usAfro-Americans. I made them _think_ about it, that they are our blood brothers, and we all camefrom the same foreparents. That's why the Africans loved me, the same way the Asians loved mebecause I was religious." 
马尔科姆·X想和我“密谈”，告诉我他旅行中的一些细节，他希望这些细节能写进书里。他说他只给我提供一些要点，因为他觉得他精心保存的日记可能会被写成另一本书。我们在我的酒店房间里进行了深入的讨论，他从日记中读给我听，我做笔记。“我想强调的是，我试图使我们的问题国际化，”他对我说，“使非洲人感到他们与我们非裔美国人之间的_血缘关系_。我让他们思考这个问题，他们就是我们的亲兄弟，我们都有同一个祖先。这就是为什么非洲人喜欢我，就像亚洲人喜欢我一样，因为我有宗教信仰。”
Within a few days, he had no more time to see me. He would call and apologize; he was beset bya host of problems, some of which he mentioned, and some of which I heard from other people.Most immediately, there was discontent within his organization, the OAAU. His having stayedaway almost three times as long as he had said he would be gone had sorely tested the moraleof even his key members, and there was a general feeling that his interest was insufficient toexpect his followers' interest to stay high. I heard from one member that "a growing disillusion"could be sensed throughout the organization. 
几天之内，他没有更多的时间来看我。他会打电话道歉；他被一大堆问题困扰，其中一些他提到了，另一些我从其他人那里听说了。最直接的是，他的组织OAAU内部不满情绪。他离开的时间几乎是他原来说的三倍，这严重考验了他甚至是他关键成员的士气，普遍感觉他的兴趣不足以期待他的追随者保持高度兴趣。我从一名成员那里听说，“在整个组织中可以感觉到一种日益增长的幻灭感”。
In Harlem at large, in the bars and restaurants, on the street corners and stoops, there could beheard more blunt criticism of Malcolm X than ever before in his career. There were, variouslyexpressed, two primary complaints. One was that actually Malcolm X only talked, but other civil- rights organizations were _doing_. "All he's _ever_ done was talk, CORE and SNCC and some ofthem people of Dr. King's are out getting beat over the head." The second major complaint wasthat Malcolm X was himself too confused to be seriously followed any longer. "He doesn't know_what_ he believes in. No sooner do you hear one thing than he's switched to something else."The two complaints were not helping the old firebrand Malcolm X image any, nor were theygenerating the local public interest that was badly needed by his small, young OAAU. 
在哈莱姆区，酒吧和餐馆，街角和门廊，可以听到对马尔科姆·X的批评比以往任何时候都要尖锐。主要有两种不同的抱怨。一种是马尔科姆·X只是说，而其他民权组织在做。“他做的所有事情就是说话，CORE和SNCC，还有马丁·路德·金博士的一些人正在被打。”第二种主要的抱怨是马尔科姆·X自己太困惑，不能再被认真地追随了。“他不知道自己相信什么。你刚听到一件事，他马上就转到另一件事上去了。”这两种抱怨并没有帮助马尔科姆·X的老煽动者形象，也没有在当地产生公众兴趣，而这正是他年轻的小OAAU急需的。
A court had made it clear that Malcolm X and his family would have to vacate the Elmhurst housefor its return to the adjudged legal owners, Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. And otherimmediate problems which Malcolm X faced included finances. Among his other expenses, a wifeand four daughters had tobe supported, along with at least one full-time OAAU official. Upon hisreturn from Africa, our agent for the book had delivered to me for Malcolm X a check for a sizablesum; soon afterward Malcolm X told me, laughing wryly, "It's _evaporated_. I don't know where!" 
法院已经明确表示，马尔科姆·X和他的家人必须离开埃尔姆赫斯特的房子，以便将其归还给被裁定为合法所有者的伊利亚·穆罕默德的伊斯兰教国家。马尔科姆·X面临的其他立即问题包括财务问题。除了他的其他开支外，他还必须养活他的妻子和四个女儿，以及至少一名全职的OAAU官员。在他从非洲回来后，我们的书的代理人给我送来了马尔科姆·X的一张大额支票；不久之后，马尔科姆·X笑着讽刺地说：“它已经消失了。我不知道它在哪里！”
Malcolm X plunged into a welter of activities. He wrote and telephoned dozens of acceptances toinvitations to speak, predominantly at colleges and universities-both to expound his philosophiesand to earn the $150-$300 honorariums above traveling expenses. When he was in New YorkCity, he spent all the time he could in his OAAU's sparsely furnished office on the mezzanine floorof the Hotel Theresa, trying to do something about the OAAU's knotty problems. "I'm not exposingour size in numbers," he evaded the query of one reporter. "You know, the strongest part of a treeis the root, and if you expose the root, the tree dies. Why, we have many 'invisible' members, ofall types. Unlike other leaders, I've practiced the flexibility to put myself into contact with everykind of Negro in the country." 
马尔科姆·X投身于繁忙的活动之中。他写信和打电话给几十个人，答应去大学和学院演讲，主要是为了阐述他的哲学观点，以及挣取高于旅行费用的150到300美元的酬金。他在纽约的时候，一有时间就去位于瑟瑟萨酒店二楼隔板上的美国黑人争取平等大会的办公室，试图解决这个组织棘手的问题。“我不是告诉你我们的成员人数，”他避开了一个记者的提问。“你知道，树的最强的部分是根，如果你暴露了根，树就会死。我们有许多‘隐形’的成员，各种各样的。与别的领导人不同，我练习了灵活性，让自己接触到全国各种类型的黑人。”
Even at mealtimes, at his favorite Twenty Two Club, or elsewhere in Harlem, he could scarcelyeat for the people who came up asking for appointments to discuss with him topics ranging frompersonal problems to his opinions on international issues. It seemed not in him to say "No" tosuch requests. And aides of his, volunteering their time, as often as not had to wait lengthyperiods to get his ear for matters important to the OAAU, or to himself; often, even then, he mostuncharacteristically showed an impatience with their questions or their suggestions, and theychafed visibly. And at least once weekly, generally on Sunday evenings, he would address asmany Negroes as word of mouth and mimeographed advertising could draw to hear him inHarlem's Audubon Ballroom on West 166th Street between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue,near New York City's famous Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. 
即使在用餐时间，即使在他在哈莱姆最喜欢的二十二俱乐部，或者在其他地方，他也几乎无法吃饭，因为人们会来找他讨论各种话题，从个人问题到他对国际问题的看法。他似乎无法对这样的请求说“不”。而他的助手们，自愿抽出时间，往往要等很长时间才能得到他的注意，无论是对OAAU还是对他自己来说，都是重要的事情；很多时候，即使这样，他也会表现出非常不寻常的对他们的问题或建议的不耐烦，他们明显地感到不安。每周至少一次，通常在周日晚上，他会发表演讲，让尽可能多的黑人听到他在纽约市著名的哥伦比亚长老会医疗中心附近的百老汇和圣尼古拉斯大道之间的西166街的哈莱姆奥杜邦礼堂的演讲，这是通过口头传播和油印广告吸引来的。
Malcolm X for some reason suddenly began to deliver a spate of attacks againstElijahMuhammad, making more bitter accusations of "religious fakery" and "immorality" than he everhad. Very possibly, Malcolm X had grown increasingly incensed by the imminence of the court'sdeadline for him to have to move his wife and four little daughters from the comfortable home inwhich they had lived for years in Elmhurst. And Sister Betty was again pregnant. "A home is reallythe only thing I've ever provided Betty since we've been married," he had told me, discussing thecourt's order, "and they want to take that away. Man, I can't keep on putting her through changes,all she's put up with-man, I've _got_ to love this woman!" 
由于某种原因，马尔科姆·X突然开始对埃利亚胡·穆罕默德发起猛烈攻击，他所提出的“宗教欺诈”和“不道德”的指责比以往任何时候都要尖锐。马尔科姆·X很可能对法院即将对他下达的最后通牒感到越来越愤怒，要求他将妻子和四个年幼的女儿从他们在埃尔姆赫斯特居住多年的舒适家中搬走。而贝蒂姐妹又怀孕了。“自从我们结婚以来，我唯一能给贝蒂的就是一个家，”他告诉我，“他们却要把它拿走。伙计，我不能再让她经历这些变化了，她已经受够了——伙计，我必须爱这个女人！”
A rash of death threats were anonymously telephoned to the police, to various newspapers, to theOAAU office, and to the family's home in Elmhurst. When he went to court again, fighting to keepthe house, he was guarded by a phalanx of eight OAAU men, twenty uniformed policemen, andtwelve plain-clothes detectives. The court's decision was that the order to vacate would not bealtered. When Malcolm X reached home in Long Island, one of his followers, telephoning himthere, got, instead, a telephone company operator who said that the OL 1-6320 number was"disconnected." A carload of his OAAU followers, racing to Long Island, found Malcolm X and hisfamily perfectly safe. Inquiry of the telephone company revealed that a "Mrs. Small" had calledand requested that the service for that number be disconnected, "for vacation." The OAAUfollowers drove back to Harlem. There was an ensuing confrontation between them and followersof Elijah Muhammad in front of the Black Muslim restaurant at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue.The incident wound up with policemen who rushed to the scene finding two guns in the OAAUcar, and the six OAAU men were arrested. 
一连串的死亡威胁电话被匿名地打给警察、各家报纸、OAAU办公室和他们在埃尔姆赫斯特的家。当他再次上法庭，为保住房子而斗争时，他被八名OAAU成员、二十名穿制服的警察和十二名便衣侦探保护着。法庭的决定是，驱逐令不会改变。当马尔科姆X回到长岛的家时，他的一个追随者给他打电话，却接到了一个电话公司的接线员，说1-6320这个号码“已断线”。一车他的OAAU追随者冲向长岛，发现马尔科姆X和他的家人都很安全。向电话公司查询后发现，一位名叫“斯莫尔夫人”的人打电话要求取消那个号码的服务，“因为度假”。OAAU的追随者开车回到哈莱姆。他们和埃利亚·穆罕默德的追随者在116街和莱诺克斯大道的黑人穆斯林餐厅前发生了冲突。警察赶到现场后，发现OAAU的车里有两把枪，于是逮捕了那六名OAAU成员。
Malcolm X had a date to speak in Boston, but he was too busy to go, and he sent an OAAUassistant who spoke instead. The car returning him to the Boston Airport was blocked at the EastBoston Tunnel by another car. Reportedly, men with knives rushed out of the blockade car, butthe Malcolm X forcesshowed a shotgun, and the attackers dispersed. 
马尔科姆·X有一个在波士顿演讲的约会，但他太忙了，不能去，于是他派了一个OAAU的助手去代替他。送他回波士顿机场的车在东波士顿隧道被另一辆车堵住了。据说，那辆车的男人们带着刀冲了出来，但是马尔科姆·X的保镖们展示了猎枪，袭击者们四散开来。
Malcolm X steadily accused the Black Muslims as the source of the various attacks and threats."There is no group in the United States more able to carry out this threat than the Black Muslims,"he said. "I know, because I taught them myself ." Asked why he had attacked the Black Muslimsand Elijah Muhammad when things had seemed to be cooled down, he said, "I would not haverevealed any of this if they had left me alone." He let himself be photographed in his homeholding an automatic carbine rifle with a full double clip of ammunition that he said he kept readyfor action against any possible assassination efforts. "I have taught my wife to use it, andinstructed her to fire on anyone, white, black, or yellow, who tries to force his way inside." 
马尔科姆·X不断地指责黑人穆斯林是各种攻击和威胁的源头。“在美国，没有哪个组织比黑人穆斯林更能实施这种威胁，”他说。“我知道，因为我亲自教过他们。”当事情似乎已经平息下来时，有人问他为何攻击黑人穆斯林和伊利亚·穆罕默德，他回答说：“如果他们不惹我，我就不会揭露这些事情。”他在家中让记者拍下了他手持自动卡宾枪的照片，枪里装满了双排子弹，他说他随时准备应对任何可能的暗杀企图。“我已经教过我妻子使用这把枪，并指示她在任何试图强行闯入的人——无论是白人、黑人还是黄人——身上开枪。”
I went to New York City in December for Malcolm X's reading of final additions to the manuscript,to include the latest developments. He was further than I had ever seen him from his old assuredself, it seemed to me. He kept saying that the press was making light of his statements about thethreats on his life. "They act like I'm jiving!" He brought up again the _Saturday Evening Post_editorial. "You can't trust the publishing people, I don't care what they tell you." The agent for thebook sent to my hotel a contract dealing with foreign publication rights which needed Malcolm X'sand my signature. I signed it as he observed and handed the pen to him. He looked suspiciouslyat the contract, and said, "I had better show this thing to my lawyer," and put the contract in hisinside coat pocket. Driving in Harlem about an hour later, he suddenly stopped the car across thestreet from the 135th Street Y.M.C.A. Building. Withdrawing the contract, he signed it, and thrust itto me. "I'll trust you," he said, and drove on. 
我在十二月去纽约市听马尔科姆·X朗读他手稿的最后修改，包括最新的发展。他看起来比我以前见过的他更远，我觉得。他不断说，新闻界轻视他关于生命威胁的声明。“他们好像我是在胡扯！”他又提起了《周六晚间邮报》的社论。“你不能相信出版界的人，不管他们告诉你什么。”这本书的代理商把一份关于国外出版权的合同送到我的旅馆，需要马尔科姆·X和我的签名。我签了，他看着我，把笔递给我。他怀疑地看着合同，说：“我最好把这份东西给我的律师看看。”然后把合同塞进他的内衣口袋。一小时后在哈莱姆开车时，他突然把车停在135街的YMCA大楼对面的街道上。他拿出合同，签了，然后把它推给我。“我会信任你，”他说，然后开车走了。
With Christmas approaching, upon an impulse I bought for Malcolm X's two oldest daughters twolarge dolls, with painted brown complexions, the kind of dolls that would "walk" when held by theleft hand. When Malcolm X nextcame to my room in the Hotel Wellington, I said, "I've gottensomething for you to take to Attallah and Qubilah for Christmas gifts," and I "walked" out the dolls.Amazement, then a wide grin spread over his face. "Well, what do you know about that? Well,how about that!" He bent to examine the dolls. His expression showed how touched he was. "Youknow," he said after a while, "this isn't something I'm proud to say, but I don't think I've everbought one gift for my children. Everything they play with, either Betty got it for them, orsomebody gave it to them, never me. That's not good, I know it. I've always been too _busy_." 
圣诞节快到了，我一时冲动，给马尔科姆·X的两个大女儿买了两个大娃娃，皮肤是棕色的，是那种用左手拿着会走的娃娃。当马尔科姆·X下次来到我在惠灵顿酒店的房间时，我说：“我给你带了圣诞礼物给Attallah和Qubilah。”然后我“走”出了娃娃。他脸上先是惊讶，然后是宽广的笑容。“好吧，你知道吗？”他笑着说，“好吧，那又怎么样！”他弯下腰去检查娃娃。他的表情显示出他有多感动。“你知道，”过了一会儿他说，“我不敢说我很自豪，但我认为我从未给我的孩子买过礼物。他们玩的每一样东西，要么是贝蒂给他们的，要么是别人给他们的，从来不是我。我知道那不好，我知道。我一直太忙了。”

In early January, I flew from upstate New York to Kennedy Airport where I telephoned Malcolm Xat home and told him that I was waiting for another plane to Kansas City to witness the swearing- in of my younger brother George who had recently been elected a Kansas State Senator. "Tellyour brother for me to remember us in the alley," Malcolm X said. "Tell him that he and all of theother moderate Negroes who are getting somewhere need to always remember that it was usextremists who made it possible." He said that when I was ready to leave Kansas, to telephonehim saying when I would arrive back in New 
一月初，我从纽约州北部飞到肯尼迪机场，然后打电话给马尔科姆·X，告诉他我在等另一架飞往堪萨斯城的飞机，去见证我弟弟乔治最近当选为堪萨斯州参议员的宣誓就职仪式。“告诉他，让他记住我们在小巷里的事。”马尔科姆·X说。“告诉他，他和其他所有正在取得进步的温和黑人，都需要永远记住，是极端分子使这一切成为可能。”他说，当我准备离开堪萨斯时，给我打电话，告诉我何时会回到纽约。
York, and if he could we could get together. I did this, and he met me at Kennedy Airport. He hadonly a little while, he was so pressed, he said; he had to leave that afternoon himself for aspeaking engagement which had come up. So I made reservations for the next flight backupstate, then we went outside and sat and talked in his car in a parking lot. He talked about thepressures on him everywhere he turned, and about the frustrations, among them that no onewanted to accept anything relating to him except "my old 'hate' and 'violence' image." He said "theso-called moderate" civil rights organizations avoided him as "too militant" and the "so-calledmilitants" avoided him as "too moderate.""They won't let me turn the comer!" he once exclaimed,"I'm caught in a trap!" 
约克，如果可以的话，我们可以聚一聚。我这么做了，他在肯尼迪机场见了我。他只有很少的时间，他说他很忙，他下午还要赶去参加一个突然出现的演讲活动。所以我为下一班飞往州里的航班订了座位，然后我们走出机场，在停车场他的车里坐着聊天。他谈到了他无论走到哪里都面临的压力，以及其中的挫折，包括没有人愿意接受与他有关的任何事情，除了“我以前的‘恨’和‘暴力’形象”。他说，“所谓的温和派”民权组织避开他，说他“太激进”，而“所谓的激进派”避开他，说他“太温和”。“他们不让我转过弯！”他曾经抱怨说，“我被困在陷阱里了！”
In a happier area, we talked about the coming baby. We laughed about the four girls in a rowalready. "This one will be the boy," he said. He beamed, "If not, the _next_ one!" When I said itwas close to time for my plane to leave, he said he had to be getting on, too. I said, "Give my bestto Sister Betty," he said that he would, we shook hands and I got outside and stood as he backedthe blue Oldsmobile from its parking space. I called out "See you!" and we waved as he starteddriving away. There was no way to know that it was the last time I would see him alive. 
在一个更快乐的区域，我们谈论即将到来的婴儿。我们笑著谈论四个一排的女孩。“这个将会是男孩，”他说。他高兴地说，“如果不是，下一个！”当我告诉他我飞机快要起飞的时候，他说他也必须走了。我说，“给贝蒂修女最好的祝福，”他说他会的，我们握手，我走到外面，站在他把蓝色Oldsmobile从停车位倒出来的地方。我叫著“再见！”我们挥手，当他开始开车离开的时候。没有办法知道那是我最后一次看到他活着。

On January 19, Malcolm X appeared on the Pierre Berton television show in Canada and said, inresponse to a question about integration and intermarriage: 
在一月十九日，马尔科姆X出现在加拿大皮埃尔·贝尔顿的电视节目中，对于关于融合和通婚的问题，他回答说
"I believe in recognizing every human being as a human being-neither white, black, brown, or red;and when you are dealing with humanity as a family there's no question of integration orintermarriage. It's just o ne human being marrying another human being or one human being livingaround and with another human being. I may say, though, that I don't think it should ever be putupon a black man, I don't think the burden to defend any position should ever be put upon theblack man, because it is the white man collectively who has shown that he is hostile towardintegration and toward intermarriage and toward these other strides toward oneness. So as ablack man and especially as a black American, any stand that I formerly took, I don't think that Iwould have to defend it because it's still a reaction to the society, and it's a reaction that wasproduced by the society; and I think that it is the society that produced this that should beattacked, not the reaction that develops among the people who are the victims of that negativesociety." 
我相信每个人都应该被当作人来对待——无论是白人、黑人、棕人还是红人；当你把人类当作一个家庭来对待时，就没有融合或通婚的问题。这只是一种人类与另一种人类结婚，或者一种人类与另一种人类生活在一起。不过，我想说的是，我不认为这应该强加给黑人，我不认为应该让黑人来捍卫任何立场，因为集体来说，白人已经显示出他们对融合、通婚以及这些其他迈向一体的步骤持敌对态度。所以作为一个黑人，尤其是作为一个美国黑人，我以前所采取的任何立场，我认为我不需要去捍卫它，因为这仍然是对社会的一种反应，而这种反应是由社会产生的；我认为是产生这种反应的社会应该受到攻击，而不是那些受害于这种负面社会的人们所产生的一种反应。
 From this, it would be fair to say that one month before his death, Malcolm had revised his viewson intermarriage to the point where he regarded it as simply a personal matter. 
由此可以说，在他死前一个月，马尔科姆已经修正了他对异族通婚的看法，认为这只是一件个人的事情。

On the 28th of January, Malcolm X was on TWA's Flight No. 9 from New York that landed at aboutthree P.M. in Los Angeles. A special police intelligence squad saw Malcolm X greeted by twoclose friends, Edward Bradley and Allen Jamal, who drove him to the Statler-Hilton Hotel whereMalcolm X checked into Room 1129. Said Bradley, "As we entered the lobby, six men came inright after us. I recognized them as Black Muslims." When Malcolm X returned downstairs to thelobby, he "practically bumped into the Muslim entourage. The Muslims were stunned. Malcolm'sface froze, but he never broke his gait. Then, we knew we were facing trouble." Malcolm X'sfriends drove him to pick up "two former secretaries of Elijah Muhammad, who (had) filedpaternity suits against him," and they went to the office of the colorful Los Angeles attorneyGladys Root. Mrs. Root said that Malcolm X made accusations about Elijah Muhammad'sconduct with various former secretaries. 
1月28日，马尔科姆·X乘坐TWA第9航班从纽约起飞，下午3点左右抵达洛杉矶。一个特别的警察情报小组看到马尔科姆·X被两位密友，爱德华·布拉德利和艾伦·贾马尔迎接，他们开车送他去斯塔特勒-希尔顿酒店，在那里马尔科姆·X登记入住1129房间。布拉德利说：“当我们走进大堂时，六个人紧跟在我们后面进来。我认出他们是黑穆斯林。”当马尔科姆·X回到一楼大堂时，他“几乎撞到了穆斯林的随行人员。穆斯林们惊呆了。马尔科姆的脸僵住了，但他从未改变步伐。然后，我们知道我们遇到了麻烦。”马尔科姆·X的朋友开车送他去接“两位以前曾对他说过话的埃利亚·穆罕默德的前秘书”，他们去了洛杉矶色彩斑斓的律师格拉迪斯·鲁特的办公室。鲁特夫人说，马尔科姆·X对埃利亚·穆罕默德与几位前秘书的行为提出了指控。
After dinner, Malcolm X's two friends drove him back to the hotel. "Black Muslims were all overthe place," Bradley related. "Some were in cars and others stood around near the hotel. They hadthe hotel completely surrounded. Malcolm sized up the situation and jumped out of the car. Hewarned me to watch out and ran into the lobby. He went to his room and remained there for therest of his stay in Los Angeles." 
饭后，马尔科姆·X的两个朋友开车送他回旅馆。“黑穆斯林到处都是，”布拉德利说。“有的在车里，有的站在旅馆附近。他们把旅馆完全包围了。马尔科姆对形势进行了评估，然后从车里跳了出来。他警告我要小心，然后跑进了门厅。他去了他的房间，在洛杉矶剩下的时间里都待在那里。”
The car in which Malcolm X left the hotel, bound for the airport, was followed, said Bradley."Hardly had we got on the Freeway when we saw two carloads of Black Muslims following us.The cars started to pull alongside. Malcolm picked up my walking cane and stuck it out of a backwindow as if itwere a rifle. The two cars fell behind. We picked up speed, pulled off the airportramp, and roared up to the front of the terminal. The police were waiting and Malcolm wasescorted to the plane through an underground passageway. Then I saw Malcolm to the plane." 
马尔科姆·X离开旅馆前往机场的那辆汽车被跟踪了,布拉德利说。“我们刚上高速公路,就看到两辆载满黑穆斯林的汽车在跟踪我们。那些汽车开始并排行驶。马尔科姆拿起我的手杖,把它伸出后窗,好像那是一支步枪。那两辆车落在后面。我们加快速度,驶离机场出口,冲到航站楼前面。警察已经在等候,马尔科姆被护送到飞机上,通过一条地下通道。然后我看到马尔科姆上了飞机。”
Chicago police were waiting when the plane landed at O'Hare Airport that night at eight o'clock.Driven to the Bristol Hotel, Malcolm X checked in, and the adjoining suite was taken by membersof the police force who would keep him under steady guard for the next three days in Chicago.Malcolm X testified at the office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois which had beeninvestigating the Nation of Islam. Another day he appeared on the television program of IrvKupcinet; he described attempts that had been made to kill him. He said he had on his desk aletter naming the persons assigned to kill him. When police returned Malcolm X to his hotel "atleast 15 grim-faced Negroes (were) loitering nearby." Whispered Malcolm X to DetectiveSergeant Edward McClellan, "Those are all Black Muslims. At least two of them I recognize asbeing from New York. Elijah seems to know every move I make." Later, in his room, he told thedetective, "It's only going to be a matter of time before they catch up with me. I know too muchabout the Muslims. But their threats are not going to stop me from what I am determined to do."After that night spent in the hotel, Malcolm X was police-escorted back to O'Hare where hecaught a plane to New York City's Kennedy Airport. 
芝加哥警方在那天晚上八点飞机降落在奥黑尔机场时已经在等候。马尔科姆·X被送往布里斯托尔酒店登记入住，而警察则占据了他隔壁的套房，他们将在接下来的三天里对马尔科姆·X进行严密的监视。马尔科姆·X在伊利诺伊州总检察长办公室作证，该办公室一直在调查伊斯兰国家。另一天，他出现在Irv Kupcinet的电视节目中，描述了他们试图杀害他的企图。他说在他的办公桌上有一封信，列出了被指派要杀他的人的名字。当警察把马尔科姆·X送回酒店时，“至少有15个脸色阴郁的黑人（在附近闲逛）”。马尔科姆·X低声对侦探警长爱德华·麦卡伦说，“他们都是黑穆斯林。我至少认出了其中两个来自纽约。埃利亚似乎知道我每一步的行动。”后来，在他的房间里，他对侦探说，“他们迟早会追上我的。我对穆斯林了解得太多了。但他们对我的威胁不会阻止我去做我决定要做的事情。”在那天晚上在酒店度过之后，马尔科姆·X在警察的护送下回到奥黑尔机场，然后乘坐飞机前往纽约肯尼迪机场。
Right away, he was served with a court order of eviction from the Elmhurst home. He telephonedme upstate. His voice was strained. He told me that he had filed an appeal to the court order, thaton the next day he was going to Alabama, and thence to England and France for scheduledspeeches, and soon after returning he would go to Jackson, Mississippi, to address theMississippi Freedom Democratic Party, on February 19. Then he said-the first time he had evervoiced to me such an admission-"Haley, my nerves are shot, my brain's tired." He said that uponhis return from Mississippi, he would like to comeand spend two or three days in the town where Iwas, and read the book's manuscript again. "You say it's a quiet town. Just a couple of days ofpeace and quiet, that's what I need." I said that he knew he was welcome, but there was no needfor him to tax himself reading through the long book again, as it had only a few very minor editingchanges since he had only recently read it. "I just want to read it one more time," he said,"because 
他立刻收到了一份从艾尔默斯特家驱逐出境的法院命令。他给我打了个电话，声音显得很紧张。他告诉我他已经向法院提出了上诉，第二天他要去阿拉巴马，然后去英国和法国做预定的演讲，不久后回来他要去密西西比州杰克逊市，2月19日在那里向密西西比自由民主党发表演讲。然后他说——这是他第一次向我承认——“黑利，我的神经已经崩溃了，我的大脑已经累了。”他说他从密西西比回来后，他想来我所在的城市待上两三天，再读一遍书的手稿。“你说这是一个安静的城市。只要几天的宁静和平静，这就是我需要的。”我说他知道他是受欢迎的，但他没有必要再花时间读一遍那本长书，因为自从他最近读过之后，它只有几个非常小的编辑改动。“我只是想再读一遍，”他说，“因为……
I don't expect to read it in finished form." So we made a tentative agreement that the day after hisprojected return from Mississippi, he would fly upstate to visit for a weekend with me. Theprojected date was the Saturday and Sunday of February 20-21.Jet magazine reported Malcolm X's trip to Selma, Alabama, on the invitation of two members ofthe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Dr. Martin Luther King was in a Selma jail whenMalcolm X's arrival sent officials of Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference "into atailspin." Quickly, the SCLC's Executive Director Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend JamesBevel met with Malcolm X, urging him not to incite any incidents and cautioning him that hispresence could cause violence. "He listened with a smile," said Miss Faye Bellamy, secretary ofthe SNCC, who accompanied Malcolm X to a Negro church where he would address a massmeeting. "Remember this: nobody puts words in my mouth," he told Miss Bellamy. He told herthat "in about two weeks" he planned to start Southern recruiting for his Harlem-based OAAU. Atthe church where he would speak, Malcolm X was seated on the platform next to Mrs. MartinLuther King, to whom he leaned and whispered that he was "trying to help," she told _Jet_. " Hesaid he wanted to present an alternative; that it might be easier for whites to accept Martin'sproposals after hearing him (Malcolm X). I didn't understand him at first," said Mrs. King. "Heseemed rather anxious to let Martin know he was not causing trouble or making it difficult, but thathe was trying to make it easier. . . . Later, in the hallway, he reiterated this. He seemed sincere. . .."Addressing the mass meeting Malcolm X reportedly shouted: "I don't advocate violence, but if aman steps on my toes, I'll step on his." . . ."Whites better be glad Martin Luther King is rallying thepeople because other forces are waiting to take over if he fails." 
我不期待读到它的完成形式。因此，我们达成了一项初步协议，即在他预计从密西西比州返回的第二天，他会飞到我所在州的北部，和我一起度过一个周末。预计的日期是2月20日至21日的周六和周日。《Jet》杂志报道了马尔科姆·X应两位学生非暴力协调委员会成员的邀请，前往阿拉巴马州塞尔玛的旅行。马丁·路德·金博士在塞尔玛的监狱里，当马尔科姆·X的到来使马丁·路德·金博士的南方基督教领袖会议的官员“陷入混乱”时。很快，南方基督教领袖会议的执行主任安德鲁·扬牧师和詹姆斯·贝弗牧师会见了马尔科姆·X，敦促他不要煽动任何事件，并警告他，他的存在可能会引发暴力。陪同马尔科姆·X前往一所黑人教堂，他在那里将发表演讲的SNCC秘书费伊·贝利小姐说：“他微笑着听着。”“记住这一点：没有人能强迫我说话，”他告诉贝利小姐。他告诉她，他计划在大约两周内开始他在哈莱姆的OAAU的南方招募活动。在马尔科姆·X将要发表演讲的教堂里，他坐在马丁·路德·金夫人的旁边，她告诉他，她“正在尽力帮助”。马丁·路德·金夫人告诉《Jet》杂志说：“他说他想提出一个替代方案，让白人更容易接受马丁的提议。”“起初我不明白他，”马丁·路德·金夫人说。“他似乎很焦虑，让马丁知道他没有制造麻烦或使事情变得困难，而是试图使事情变得更容易……后来，在走廊里，他重申了这一点。他似乎很真诚……”据报道，马尔科姆·X在群众大会上说：“我不主张暴力，但如果一个人踩到我的脚，我会踩到他的脚。”……“白人最好为马丁·路德·金正在团结人民而感到高兴，因为如果他失败，其他力量正在等待接管。”
Returned to New York City, Malcolm X soon flew to France. He was scheduled to speak before aCongress of African Students. But he was formally advised that he would not be permitted tospeak and, moreover, that he could consider himself officially barred forever from France as "anundesirable person." He was asked to leave-and he did, fuming with indignation. He flew on toLondon, and reporters of the British Broadcasting Corporation took him on an interviewing tour inSmethwick, a town near Birmingham with a large colored population. Numerous residents raiseda storm of criticism that the B.B.C. was a party to a "fanning of racism" in the already tension- filled community. On this visit, he spoke also at the London School of Economics. 
回到纽约后不久，马尔科姆·X就飞往了法国。他计划在非洲学生代表大会上发言。但他正式被告知，他将不被允许发言，而且，他可以考虑自己永远被法国官方禁止入境，作为“不受欢迎的人”。他被要求离开，而且他真的怒气冲冲地离开了。他飞往了伦敦，英国广播公司的记者带他去伯明翰附近的斯梅特威克镇进行了一次采访。那里有大量的有色人种居民。许多居民对英国广播公司煽动种族主义的行为提出了强烈的批评。在这次访问中，他还曾在伦敦经济学院发表过演讲。
Malcolm X returned to New York City on Saturday, February 13th. He was asleep with his familywhen at about a quarter of three the following Sunday morning, a terrifying blast awakened them.Sister Betty would tell me later that Malcolm X, barking commands and snatching up screaming,frightened children, got the family safely out of the back door into the yard. Someone had thrownflaming Molotov cocktail gasoline bombs through the front picture window. It took the firedepartment an hour to extinguish the flames. Half the house was destroyed. Malcolm X had nofire insurance. 
马尔科姆·X在星期六，二月十三日返回纽约。他在家睡觉，当第二天早上，星期天的三点钟左右，一声可怕的爆炸声将他们惊醒。他的姐姐贝蒂后来告诉我，马尔科姆·X一边咆哮着命令，一边抓着尖叫的孩子，将他们全家安全地从后门带到了院子里。有人将燃烧的Molotov鸡尾酒汽油弹扔进了前窗。消防部门花了大约一个小时才将火扑灭。房子的一半被毁了。马尔科姆·X没有火灾保险。
Pregnant, distraught Sister Betty and the four little daughters went to the home of close friends.Malcolm X steeled himself to catch a plane as scheduled that morning to speak in Detroit. Hewore an open-necked sweater shirt under his suit. Immediately afterward, he flew back to NewYork. Monday morning, amid a flurry of emergency re-housing plans for his family. Malcolm X wasoutraged when he learned that Elijah Muhammad's New York Mosque Number 7 Minister JamesX had told the press that Malcolm X himself had fire-bombed the home "to get publicity." 
怀孕、心烦意乱的贝蒂修女和四个小女儿去了亲密朋友的家。马尔科姆·X早上按计划把自己武装起来，准备坐飞机去底特律演讲。他穿着开领毛衣衫，外面套着西装。之后，他立刻飞回纽约。周一早上，他忙于为家人制定紧急住房计划。当马尔科姆·X得知埃利亚·穆罕默德的纽约清真寺第七号部长詹姆斯·X告诉媒体，马尔科姆·X本人放火烧了房子“以获取公众关注”时，他感到非常愤怒。
Monday night, Malcolm X spoke to an audience in the familiar Audubon Ballroom. If he hadpossessed the steel nerves not to become rattled in public before, now he was: "I've reached theend of my rope!" he shouted to the audience of five hundred. "I wouldn't care for myself if theywould not harm my family!" He declared flatly, "My house was bombed by the _Muslims_!" And hehinted at revenge. "There are hunters; there are also those who hunt the hunters!" 
星期一晚上，马尔科姆·X在熟悉的奥杜邦礼堂向听众讲话。如果他以前在公众面前没有表现出钢铁般的神经，那么现在他就是：他对五百名听众喊道：“我已经到了绳子的尽头！”如果他们不伤害我的家人，我就不在乎我自己！”他断然宣称，“我的房子被穆斯林炸毁了！”他暗示复仇。“有猎人；也有猎杀猎人的！”
Tuesday, February 16th, Malcolm X telephoned me. He spoke very briefly, saying that thecomplications following the bombing of his home had thrown his plans so awry that he would beunable to visit me upstate on the weekend as he had said he would. He said he had also had tocancel his planned trip to 
星期二，二月十六日，马尔科姆·X打电话给我。他讲话非常简短，说他家被炸后的并发症使他的计划完全被打乱，以致于他将不能象他所说的那样在周末来上州看我。他说他也必须取消他计划去
Jackson, Mississippi, which he was going to try and make later. He said he had to hurry to anappointment, and hung up. I would read later where also on that day, he told a close associate, "Ihave been marked for death in the next five days. I have the names of five Black Muslims whohave been chosen to kill me. I will announce them at the meeting." And Malcolm X told a friendthat he was going to apply to the Police Department for a permit to carry a pistol. "I don't knowwhether they will let me have one or not, as I served time in prison." 
他告诉我要尽快赶到密西西比州的杰克逊市去，他要去那里试一试。他说他得赶紧去赴一个约会，然后就挂断了电话。我后来读到，那天他还告诉一个亲密的助手说：“我将在接下来的五天内被暗杀。我已经知道了五个黑人穆斯林的名字，他们被选中来杀我。我将在会议上公布他们的名字。”马尔科姆·X还告诉一个朋友说，他要向警察局申请持枪许可证。“我不知道他们是否会让我得到，因为我坐过牢。”
On Thursday he told a reporter, in an interview which did not appear until after his death: "I'm manenough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'mflexible." 
星期四，他在一次访谈中告诉一名记者，该访谈在他死后才发表：“我足够坦率地告诉你，我现在无法准确地指出我的哲学是什么，但我很灵活。”
The blackboard in the OAAU office counseled members and visitors that "Bro.Malcolm SpeaksThurs. Feb. 18, WINS Station, 10:30 P.M." Earlier Thursday, Malcolm X discussed locatinganother home with a real estate dealer. On Friday, he had an appointment with Gordon Parks, the_Life_ magazine photographer-author whom he had long admired and respected. "He appearedcalm and somewhat resplendent with his goatee and astrakhan hat," Parks would report later in_Life_. "Much of the old hostility and bitterness seemed to have left him, but the fire andconfidence were still there." Malcolm X, speaking of the old Mosque Number 7 days, said, "Thatwas a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days-I'm glad to be free of them.It's a time for martyrs now. And if I'm to be one, it will be in the cause of brotherhood. That's theonly thing that can save this country. I've learned it the hard way-but I've learned it. . . ." 
OAAU 办公室的黑板劝告会员和访客：“Malcolm 兄弟讲话，星期四，二月十八日，晚上十点半，WINS电台。”星期四早些时候，Malcolm X 与一位房地产经纪人讨论了找房子的事。星期五，他与他一直崇拜和尊重的《生活》杂志摄影师兼作家 Gordon Parks 约好见面。“他看上去冷静而有些华丽，留着山羊胡，戴着 Astrakhan 帽子，”Gordon Parks 后来在《生活》杂志上写道。“他身上那种旧有的敌意和痛苦似乎已经消失，但他的热情和信心仍在。”Malcolm X 说起旧的第七清真寺的日子，说：“那是糟糕的一幕，兄弟。那些日子的病态和疯狂——我很高兴摆脱了它们。现在是烈士的时代。如果我必须成为烈士，那将是为了兄弟情谊。这是拯救这个国家的唯一办法。我艰难地学到了这一点——但我学到了。”
Parks asked Malcolm X if it was really true that killers were after him. "It's as true as we arestanding here," Malcolm X said. * 'They've tried it twice in the last two weeks." Parks asked himabout police protection, and Malcolm X laughed, "Brother, nobody can protect you from a Muslimbut a Muslim-or someone trained in Muslim tactics. I know. I invented many of those tactics." 
帕克斯问马尔科姆·X是否真的有人要暗杀他。马尔科姆·X说:“就像我们站在这里一样真实。”“他们在过去的两周里试过两次。”帕克斯问他是否得到了警察的保护，马尔科姆·X笑着说:“兄弟，除了穆斯林，没有人能保护你不受穆斯林的伤害——或者受过穆斯林战术训练的人。我知道，我发明了许多这样的战术。”
Recalling the incident of the young white college girl who had come to the Black Muslimrestaurant and asked "What can I _do_?" and he told her "Nothing," and she left in tears, MalcolmX told Gordon Parks, "Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continentI saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did manythings as a Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then-like all Muslims-I was hypnotized,pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool ofhimself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me twelve years." 
想起那个白人大学女生来到黑人穆斯林餐馆，问“我能做什么？”他告诉她“什么也不能做”，她流着眼泪离开了。马尔科姆·X告诉戈登·帕克斯，“嗯，我为此事感到后悔。在非洲大陆的许多地方，我看到白人学生帮助黑人。类似这样的事情可以消除很多争论。作为一个穆斯林，我做了很多我现在感到抱歉的事情。那时我就像所有的穆斯林一样，被催眠了，被指向某个方向，被告知要前进。好吧，我想如果一个人愿意付出代价，他就有权让自己出丑。这花了我十二年的时间。”
Saturday morning, he drove Sister Betty to see a real estate man. The house that the man thenshowed them that Malcolm X particularly liked, in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood also onLong Island, required a $3000 down payment. Sister Betty indicated her approval, too, andMalcolm X told the real estate man he thought they would take it. Driving Sister Betty back to thefriends' home where she was staying with the children, they estimated that it would cost themabout another $1000 to make the move. He stayed until mid-afternoon with Sister Betty at thefriends' home, talking. He told her that he realized that she had been under protracted greatstrain, and that he was sorry about it. When he got his hat to leave, to drive into Manhattan,standing in the hallway, he told Sister Betty, "We'll all be together. I want my family with me.Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you. We'll get somebodyto keep the children. I'll never leave you so long again." 
星期六早上，他开车送贝蒂修女去看一个房地产经纪人。经纪人给他们看的那所房子，马尔科姆·X特别喜欢，位于长岛的一个主要由犹太人居住的社区，需要3000美元的首付款。贝蒂修女也表示同意，马尔科姆·X告诉房地产经纪人，他认为他们会买下这所房子。开车送贝蒂修女回到她和孩子们住的朋友家后，他们估计搬家大约还需要1000美元。他在朋友家和贝蒂修女待到下午中，聊天。他告诉她，他意识到她一直在承受巨大的压力，对此他感到抱歉。当他戴上帽子准备离开，开车去曼哈顿时，站在走廊里，他对贝蒂修女说：“我们都会在一起的。我想要我的家人和我在一起。家庭不应该被分开。我再也不会没有你而进行长途旅行了。我们会找人照看孩子们。我再也不会让你离开我那么久了。”
"I couldn't help but just break out grinning," Sister Betty would later tell me. 
"我忍不住笑了出来，"贝蒂姐妹后来告诉我。
She figured that he must have stopped at a nearby drugstore to use the telephone booth when Ilater told her that Malcolm X had telephoned me upstate at about 3:30 that afternoon. 
她认为他一定是到附近的药店去用电话亭打电话，后来艾尔特告诉她，马尔科姆·X那天下午大约3点半给我打过电话。
For the first time in nearly two years, I did not recognize immediately that the voice on the otherend of the phone belonged to Malcolm X. He sounded as if he had a heavy, deep cold. He toldme that in the middle of the night he and some friends had helped a moving company's men takeout of the other house all of the family's furniture and other belongings salvageable after the fire- bombing-before a sheriff's eviction party would set the things out on the sidewalk. "Betty and Ihave been looking at a house we want to buy"-he tried a chuckle-"you know nobody's going to_rent_, not to _me_, these days! "He said, "All I've got is about $150," and that he needed a$3000 down-payment plus $1000 moving costs; he asked if I thought the publisher wouldadvance him $4000 against the projected profits from the book. I said that when our agent'soffices opened on Monday morning, I would telephone and I knew thathe would query thepublisher to see if it couldn't be arranged, then Monday night I would call him back and let himknow. 
近二年来，我第一次听不出电话那头的声音是马尔科姆·X的。他听起来像是得了重感冒，声音低沉。他告诉我，半夜里，他和几个朋友帮一家搬家公司的人把那家人在纵火焚烧后还能救出的家具和其他财物从另一所房子里搬出来，以免在警长的驱逐派对上把东西丢到人行道上。他说：“我和贝蒂看中了一所想买的房子里——”他试着笑了笑——“你知道，现在没人会租给我，不会租给我这样的！”他说他现在只有150美元，“我需要3000美元的首付款外加1000美元的搬家费”，他问我是否认为出版商能预支4000美元给他，以支付预计的书的利润。我说，等我们的代理公司的办公室星期一上午开门后，我会打电话，我知道他会向出版商查询，看是否可以安排，然后星期一晚上我会再打电话给他，让他知道。
He said that he and Sister Betty had decided that although they were going to pay for the house,to avoid possible trouble they had gotten the agreement of his sister Ella who lived in Boston tolet the house be bought in her name. He said that he still owed $1500 to his sister Ella which shehad loaned him to make one trip abroad. Eventually they would change the house's title intoSister Betty's name, he said, or maybe into the name of their oldest daughter, Attallah. 
他说他和贝蒂姐姐已经决定，尽管他们要付房子的钱，为了避免可能出现的麻烦，他们已经得到了他住在波士顿的姐姐埃拉的同意，让她以她的名义买下这所房子。他说他仍然欠他姐姐埃拉1500美元，她借给他让他出国旅行一次。他说最终他们会把房子的名字改为贝蒂姐姐的名字，或者也许改为他们最大的女儿阿塔拉的名字。
He digressed on the dangers he faced. "But, you know, I'm going to tell you something, brother- the more I keep thinking about this thing, the things that have been happening lately, I'm not allthat sure it's the Muslims. I know what they can do, and what they can't, and they can't do someof the stuff recently going on. Now, I'm going to tell you, the more I keep thinking about whathappened to me in France, I think I'm going to quit saying it's the Muslims." 
他岔开话题谈到了他所面临的危险。“不过，你知道，我要告诉你一件事，兄弟——我越是思考这件事，以及最近发生的事情，我就越不确定是不是穆斯林干的。我知道他们能做什么，不能做什么，而他们最近不能做的一些事情。现在，我要告诉你，我越是思考在法国发生的事，我就越觉得我不再认为是穆斯林干的了。”
Then-it seemed to me such an odd, abrupt change of subject: "You know, I'm glad I've been thefirst to establish official ties between Afro-Americans and our blood brothers in Africa." And sayinggood-bye, he hung up. 
然后,在我看来,这是一个如此奇怪、如此突然的话题转变:“你知道,我很高兴我是第一个在非裔美国人和我们在非洲的血缘兄弟之间建立官方联系的人。”然后说再见,他挂断了电话。
After that telephone call, Malcolm X drove on into Manhattan and to the New York Hilton Hotelbetween 53rd and 54th Streets at Rockefeller Center. He checked the blue Oldsmobile into thehotel garage and then, in the lobby, he checked himself in and was assigned a twelfth-floor room,to which a bellman accompanied him. 
打完电话后，马尔科姆·X驱车进入曼哈顿，来到位于洛克菲勒中心第五十三街和第五十四街之间的纽约希尔顿饭店。他把那辆蓝色的奥尔兹莫比尔轿车停在饭店的停车场，然后走进大厅，办理了住宿手续，被安排住进了十二楼的一个房间，这时，一位行李搬运工陪他上了楼。
Soon some Negro men entered the giant hotel's busy lobby. They began asking various bellmenwhat room Malcolm X was in. The bellmen, of course, never would answer that questionconcerning any guest-and considering that it wasMalcolm X whom practically everyone who readNew York City newspapers knew was receiving constant death threats, the bellmen quicklynotified the hotel's security chief. From then until Malcolm X checked out the next day, extrasecurity vigilance was continuously maintained on the twelfth floor. During that time, Malcolm Xleft the room only once, to have dinner in the hotel's lobby-level, dimly lit Bourbon Room. 
不久，一些黑人男子走进了这家大旅馆繁忙的大厅。他们开始向各种门童询问马尔科姆·X的房间号码。门童当然不会回答任何关于客人的这个问题——考虑到马尔科姆·X实际上是纽约市几乎所有读过报纸的人都知道他正在不断收到死亡威胁，门童迅速通知了旅馆的安全主管。从那时起，直到马尔科姆·X第二天退房，第十二层楼都一直保持着额外的安全警戒。在这段时间里，马尔科姆·X只离开过一次房间，去旅馆的大厅层，光线昏暗的波旁酒室吃晚饭。
Sunday morning at nine o'clock, Sister Betty in Long Island was surprised when her husbandtelephoned her and asked if she felt it would be too much trouble for her to get all of the fourchildren dressed and bring them to the two o'clock meeting that afternoon at the AudubonBallroom in Harlem. She said, "Of course it won't!" On Saturday he had told her that she couldn'tcome to the meeting. He said to her, "You know what happened an hour ago? Exactly at eighto'clock, the phone woke me up. Some man said, 'Wake up, brother' and hung up." Malcolm Xsaid good-bye to Sister Betty. 
星期天早上九点钟，当长岛的贝蒂修女接到丈夫的电话，问她是否觉得麻烦，要她把四个孩子都打扮好，带到下午两点在哈莱姆区奥杜邦舞厅的会议时，她感到很惊讶。她说：“当然不会！” 星期六，他告诉她不能参加会议。他对她说：“你知道一小时前发生了什么吗？正好在八点钟，电话把我吵醒了。一个男人说：‘醒醒，兄弟’，然后挂断了电话。” 马尔科姆·X向贝蒂修女道别。
And four hours later, Malcolm X left his room and took an elevator down to the lobby, where hechecked out. He got his car and in the clear, warm midday of Sunday, February 21, he droveuptown to the Audubon Ballroom. 
四个小时后,马尔科姆X离开了他的房间,乘电梯下到大厅,办理了退房手续。他取了他的车,在2月21日星期天,阳光明媚的午后,驱车前往阿都宾音乐厅。
*     *     * 
The Audubon Ballroom, between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue, on the south side of West166th Street, is a two-story building frequently rented for dances, organization functions, andother affairs. A dark, slender, pretty young lady, occupationally a receptionist and avocationally ahardworking OAAU assistant to Malcolm X, has since told me that she arrived early, about 1:30P.M. , having some preliminary work to do. Entering, she saw that the usual 400 wooden chairshad been set up, with aisles on either side, but no center aisle; the young lady (she wishes to benameless) noticed that several people were already seated in the front rows, but she gave it nothought since somealways came early, liking to get seats up close to the stage, to savor to thefullest the dramatic orator Malcolm X. On the stage, behind the speaker's stand, were eightstraight brown chairs arranged in a row and behind it was the stage's painted backdrop, a muralof a restful country scene. The young lady's responsibilities for this day had included makingarrangements and subsequent confirmations with the scheduled co-speaker, the Reverend MiltonGalamison, the militant Brooklyn Presbyterian who in 1964 had led the two one-day Negroboycotts in New York City public schools, protesting "racial imbalance." She had similarly madearrangements with some other prominent Negroes who were due to appeal to the audience fortheir maximum possible contributions to aid the work of Malcolm X and his organization. 
奥杜邦舞厅,位于百老汇和圣尼古拉斯大道之间,在西166街的南侧,是一座两层楼的建筑,经常被租用作舞会、组织活动和其他事务。一位黑人女性告诉我,她是一个接待员,兼职是马尔科姆·X的助理,那天下午1:30左右到达舞厅,有一些初步的工作要做。她走进舞厅,看到通常的400把木椅已经摆好,两侧有通道,但没有中心通道。她注意到已经有几个人坐在前排,但她没有多想,因为有些人总是来得早,喜欢坐在靠近舞台的地方,尽情欣赏马尔科姆·X的演讲。舞台上,讲台后面有八把棕色的直背椅,后面是舞台的粉刷背景,一幅宁静的乡村壁画。那天,她的职责之一是与预定的联合演讲者——激进的布鲁克林长老会牧师米尔顿·加拉米森安排和确认。1964年,加拉米森曾领导了两次为期一天的纽约公立学校黑人罢课,抗议“种族失衡”。她还与一些其他知名黑人安排了活动,他们将呼吁观众为马尔科姆·X及其组织的最大可能捐款。
The people who entered the ballroom were not searched at the door. In recent weeks, Malcolm Xhad become irritable about this, saying "It makes people uncomfortable" and that it reminded himof Elijah Muhammad. "If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be?" he had once saidtestily. For this day, also, he had ordered the press-as such-barred, white or black. He was angryat what he interpreted as "slanted" press treatment recently; he felt especially that thenewspapers had not taken seriously his statements of the personal danger he was in. UnitedPress International reporter Stanley Scott, a Negro, had been admitted, he later said, when aMalcolm lieutenant decided, "As a Negro, you will be allowed to enter as a citizen if you like, butyou must remove your press badge." The same criterion had applied to WMCA newsman HughSimpson. Both he and Scott came early enough so that they obtained seats up near the stage. 
走进舞厅的人们没有在门口被搜查。最近几周，马尔科姆·X对此感到烦躁不安，他说：“这让人感到不舒服”，并且这让他想起了埃利亚·穆罕默德。“如果我在自己的同类中都感到不安全，我还能在哪里感到安全呢？”他有一次不耐烦地说。对于这一天，他也命令新闻界——无论是白人还是黑人——禁止入内。他对于自己最近所认为的“有偏见”的新闻报道感到愤怒；他特别觉得报纸没有认真对待他关于自己面临个人危险的声明。美联社记者斯坦利·斯科特是一名黑人，他后来表示，当马尔科姆的副官决定，“作为黑人，如果你愿意的话，你可以作为一个公民进入，但你必须摘下你的记者证。”同样的标准也适用于WMCA的新闻工作者休·辛普森。他和斯科特都来得足够早，因此他们获得了靠近舞台的座位。
Malcolm X entered the ballroom at shortly before two o'clock, trudging heavily instead of with hisusual lithe strides, his young lady assistant has told me. By this time several other of hisassistants were filtering in and out of the small anteroom alongside the stage. He sat downsideways on a chair, his long legs folded around its bottom, and he leaned one elbow on a kind ofcounter beforea rather rickety make-up mirror that entertainers used when dances were held inthe ballroom. He wore a dark suit, white shirt and narrow dark tie. He said to a little group of hisassistants that he wasn't going to talk about his personal troubles, "I don't want that to be thereason for anyone to come to hear me." He stood up and paced about the little room. He said hewas going to state that he had been hasty to accuse the Black Muslims of bombing his home."Things have happened since that are bigger than what they can do. I know what they can do.Things have gone beyond that." 
马尔科姆·X在两点差几分的时候走进了舞厅，他的年轻女助手告诉我，他拖着沉重的脚步，而不是像往常那样轻盈地走着。这时，他的其他几个助手正在舞台旁边的狭小前厅里进进出出。他坐在椅子的侧面，长长的腿交叉在椅子下面，一只胳膊肘靠在舞台上的一种柜台前，柜台前是一面摇摇欲坠的化妆镜，艺人举行舞会时会在舞厅里使用。他穿着一套深色西装，白色衬衫和一条窄窄的深色领带。他对一群助手说，他不打算谈论他的个人问题，“我不想让那些成为任何人来听我演讲的原因。”他站起来，在小房间里踱步。他说他将宣布，他曾经匆忙地指责黑穆斯林炸毁了他的家。“自从那件事发生以来，发生了比他们能做的更大的事情。我知道他们能做什么。事情已经超出了那个范围。”
Those in the anteroom could hear the sounds of the enlarging audience outside taking seats."The way I feel, I ought not to go out there at all today," Malcolm X said. "In fact, I'm going to easesome of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself-that's all a part of the white man'sbig maneuver, to keep us fighting among ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone,that's not what we're here for." He kept glancing at his wrist watch, anticipating the arrival ofReverend Galamison. "Whenever you make any appointment with a minister," he said to hisyoung lady assistant, "you have to call them two or three hours before time, because they willchange their mind. This is typical of ministers." 
"在前厅的人可以听到外面扩大的观众坐座位的声音。"我感觉我今天不应该出去。"马尔科姆·X说。"事实上，我要通过告诉黑人不要自相残杀来缓解一些紧张，那都是白人的一大策略，让我们互相争斗，互相反对。我不和任何人战斗，那不是我们来这里的目的。"他不停地瞥着手表，期待加拉蒙森牧师的到来。"无论你和牧师约什么时间，"他对他的年轻女助手说，"你必须在时间前两三个小时打电话给他们，因为他们会改变主意。这是牧师的典型做法。"
"I felt bad, I felt that it was my fault," the young lady told me. "It was time for the meeting to start,too." She turned to Malcolm X's stalwart assistant Benjamin X, known as a highly able speakerhimself. "Brother, will you speak?" she asked-then, turning to Malcolm X, "Is it all right if hespeaks? And maybe he could introduce you." Malcolm X abruptly whirled on her, and barked,"You know you shouldn't ask me right in front of him!" Then, collecting himself quickly, he said"Okay." Brother Benjamin X asked how long he should speak. Malcolm X said, glancing again athis wrist watch, "Make it half an hour." And Brother Benjamin X went through the door leadingonto the stage. They heard him expertly exhorting the audience about what is needed today by"the black man here in these United States."The Reverend Galamison and other notables due hadn't arrived by three o'clock. "BrotherMalcolm looked so disappointed," the young lady says. "He said to me 'I don't think any of themare coming, either.' I felt so terrible for him. It did seem as if no one cared. I told him 'Oh, don'tworry, they're just late, they'll be here.'" (It was also reported by another source that Galamison,unable to come to the meeting, did telephone earlier, and that Malcolm X was told of this beforehe went out to speak.) 
"我感觉很糟糕，我觉得那是我的错，"这位年轻的女士告诉我。"会议也该开始了。"她转向了马尔科姆·X坚定的助手本杰明·X，他以能说会道而闻名。"兄弟，你能发言吗？"她问，然后转向马尔科姆·X，"他发言可以吗？也许他可以为你做介绍。"马尔科姆·X突然转过身来，冲她吼道，"你知道你不应该在我面前问他！"然后，他迅速整理好自己，说"好吧。"本杰明·X兄弟问应该讲多久。马尔科姆·X看了下手表，说，"讲半小时吧。"然后本杰明·X兄弟穿过通往舞台的门。他们听到他熟练地鼓动观众，谈论"美国黑人今天需要什么。"到三点钟，加拉米森牧师和其他知名人士还没有到。"马尔科姆兄弟看起来很失望，"这位年轻的女士说。"他对我说，'我觉得他们一个都不会来。'"我为他感到非常难过。看起来似乎没有人关心。我告诉他，'哦，别担心，他们只是晚了，他们会来的。'"（另一个消息来源也报道说，加拉米森无法参加会议，他之前曾打电话来，马尔科姆·X在出去发言之前就知道了这件事。）
Then Brother Benjamin X's half-hour was up, and the young lady and Malcolm X, alone backthere in the anteroom, could hear him entering the introduction: "And now, without furtherremarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you, a man who wouldgive his life for you-I want you to hear, listen, to understand-one who is a _trojan_ for the blackman!" 
然后,本杰明·X的半小时到了,这位年轻的女士和马尔科姆·X单独在前厅里,可以听到他开始介绍:“现在,没有更多的评论,我向你们介绍一个愿意为你们冒险的人,一个愿意为你们献出生命的人——我希望你们听,听,理解——一个为黑人而战的特洛伊木马!”
Applause rose from the audience; at the anteroom door, Malcolm X turned and looked back at hisyoung lady assistant. 
观众席上传来掌声；在前厅门口，马尔科姆·X转过身来，回头看着他的年轻女助手。
"You'll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you-I'm just a bout at my wit's end." 
你必须原谅我对你的大声喊叫——我几乎要急疯了。
"Oh, don't _mention_ it!" she said quickly, "I understand." 
“哦，别提了！”她迅速地说，“我明白了。”
His voice sounded far away, "I wonder if anybody _really_ understands-" And he walked out ontothe stage, into the applause, smiling and nodding at Brother Benjamin X who passed him enroute to the anteroom. 
他的声音听起来很遥远，“我真想知道是否有人——”他走上舞台，进入掌声中，微笑着向本杰明·X兄弟点头致意，本杰明·X兄弟正从他身边经过，走向休息室。
The young lady had picked up some paperwork she had to do when Benjamin X came in,perspiring. She patted his hand, saying, "That was good!" Through the anteroom door, just ajar,she and Benjamin X heard the applause diminishing, then the familiar ringing greeting,"_Asalaikum_, brothers and sisters!""Asalaikum salaam!" some in the audience responded. 
年轻的女士进来时，手里拿着一些她必须做的文件，大汗淋漓。她拍了拍本杰明的手，说：“干得好！”通过前厅的门，只开了半扇，她和本杰明听到了掌声逐渐减弱，然后听到了熟悉的问候：“_Asalaikum_，兄弟姐妹们！”“_Asalaikum_ 沙拉姆！”观众中有人回应。
About eight rows of seats from the front, then, a disturbance occurred. In a sudden scuffling, aman's voice was raised angrily, "Take your hand out of my pocket!" The entire audience wasswiveling to look. "Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited," Malcolm X said crisply, "Let's cool it,brothers- With his own attention distracted, it is possible that he never saw the gunmen. One woman whowas seated near the front says, "The commotion back there diverted me just for an instant, then Iturned back to look at Malcolm X just in time to see at least three men in the front row stand andtake aim and start firing simultaneously. It looked like a firing squad." Numerous persons latersaid they saw two men rushing toward the stage, one with a shotgun, the other with tworevolvers. Said U.P.I, reporter Stanley Scott: "Shots rang out. Men, women and children ran forcover. They stretched out on the floor and ducked under tables." Radio Station WMCA reporterHugh Simpson said, "Then I heard this muffled sound, I saw Malcolm hit with his hands stillraised, then he fell back over the chairs behind him. Everybody was shouting. I saw one manfiring a gun from under his coat behind me as I hit it [the floor], too. He was firing like he was insome Western, running backward toward the door and firing at the same time." 
大约在前排八排座位的地方，接着发生了一阵骚动。突然，一个男人愤怒地大声喊道：“把手从我口袋里拿出来！”整个观众都转过头来看。 “别激动，别激动，”马尔科姆·X冷静地说，“兄弟们，让我们冷静下来。由于自己的注意力被分散，他可能从未看到枪手。一位坐在前排的女士说：“后面的骚动吸引了我一瞬间，然后我转过头来看马尔科姆·X，正好看到至少有三个人在前排站起来瞄准并同时开火。看起来就像一个枪决队。”后来许多人说他们看到两个人冲向舞台，一个拿着猎枪，另一个拿着两把手枪。美联社记者斯坦利·斯科特说：“枪声响起，男人、女人和孩子都跑去掩护。他们躺在地板上，躲在桌子下面。”无线电台WMCA记者休·辛普森说：“然后我听到一种模糊的声音，我看到马尔科姆双手仍然举着，然后他倒在椅子后面。每个人都在喊叫。我看到一个人在我身后用他的大衣开枪，我也倒在地上。他开枪的样子就像他在西部片中一样，向后跑向门口，同时开枪。”
The young lady who was in the backstage anteroom told me, "It sounded like an army had takenover. Somehow, I knew. I wouldn't go and look. I wanted to remember him as he was." 
在后台休息室的那位年轻女士告诉我:“听起来像是一支军队接管了。不知怎的，我知道。我不想去看看。我想记住他原来的样子。”
Malcolm X's hand flew to his chest as the first of sixteen shotgun pellets or revolver slugs hit him.Then the other hand flew up. The middle finger of the left hand was bullet-shattered, and bloodgushed from his goatee. He clutchedhis chest. His big body suddenly fell back stiffly, knockingover two chairs; his head struck the stage floor with a thud. 
马尔科姆·X的手飞快地伸向他的胸口，当第一颗霰弹枪或左轮手枪的子弹击中他时。然后他的另一只手也飞了起来。左手的中指被子弹打碎，血从他的小胡子上涌出。他抓住自己的胸口。他的大身体突然僵硬地向后倒下，撞倒了两把椅子；他的头重重地撞在舞台上。
In the bedlam of shouting, screaming, running people, some ran toward the stage. Among themSister Betty scrambled up from where she had thrown her body over her children, who wereshrieking; she ran crying hysterically, "My husband! They're killing my husband!" An unidentifiedphotographer snapped shots of Malcolm X prone on the stage floor with people bent over himsnatching apart his bloody shirt, loosening his tie, trying to give him mouth-to-mouth artificialrespiration, first a woman, then a man. Said the woman, who identified herself only as aregistered nurse, "I don't know how I got up on the stage, but I threw myself down on who Ithought was Malcolm-but it wasn't. I was willing to die for the man, I would have taken the bulletsmyself; then I saw Malcolm, and the firing had stopped, and I tried to give him artificialrespiration." Then Sister Betty came through the people, herself a nurse, and people recognizingher moved back; she fell on her knees looking down on his bare, bullet-pocked chest, sobbing,"They killed him!" 
在一片叫喊、尖叫、奔跑的人群中，一些人朝舞台跑去。其中，贝蒂修女从她扔在尖叫的孩子们身上的地方爬起来，她哭着跑过去，"我丈夫！他们在杀我丈夫！" 一个身份不明的摄影师拍下了马尔科姆·X俯卧在舞台地板上的照片，人们弯下腰，扯开他血迹斑斑的衬衫，解开他的领带，试图给他做人工呼吸，先是女人，然后是男人。这位女性自称是一名注册护士，她说："我不知道我是怎么上台的，但我跳到我以为是马尔科姆的人身上，但那不是。我愿意为这个人去死，我本打算自己去挡子弹，然后我看到了马尔科姆，射击已经停止，我试图给他做人工呼吸。" 然后贝蒂修女从人群中挤过去，她自己也是一名护士，人们认出她后就让开了；她跪在地上，看着他那裸露的、布满弹孔的胸膛，哭泣着说："他们杀了他！"
Patrolman Thomas Hoy, 22, was stationed outside the Audubon Ballroom entrance. "I heard theshooting and the place exploded." He rushed inside, he saw Malcolm X lying on the stage, andthen some people chasing a man. Patrolman Hoy "grabbed the suspect."Louis Michaux, the owner of the Nationalist Memorial Bookstore at 125th Street and SeventhAvenue in Harlem, said, "I was arriving late at the meeting where Malcolm X had invited me, I meta large number of people rushing out." 
巡警托马斯·霍伊，22岁，被派往奥杜邦礼堂入口处站岗。“我听到枪声，礼堂爆炸了。”他冲进礼堂，看见马尔科姆·X躺在舞台上，然后有人追赶一名男子。巡警霍伊“抓住了嫌疑人”。哈莱姆区125街和第七大道的国家纪念书店老板路易斯·米肖说：“我正赶往马尔科姆·X邀请我参加的会议，我遇到一大群人冲了出来。”
Sergeant Alvin Aronoff and Patrolman Louis Angelos happened to be cruising by in their radio carwhen they heard shots. "When we got there," said Aronoff, "the crowds were pushing out andscreaming 'Malcolm's been shot!' and 'Get 'im, get 'im, don't let him go!'" The two policemengrabbed by the arms aNegro who was being kicked as he tried to escape. Firing a warning shotinto the air, the policemen pushed the man into their police car, not wanting the angry crowd toclose in, and drove him quickly to the police station. 
阿尔文·阿尔诺夫中士和巡逻警察路易斯·安吉洛斯碰巧正在无线电巡逻车里巡逻，这时他们听到了枪声。“当我们到达那里时，”阿尔诺夫说，“人群正在涌出，尖叫着‘马尔科姆被枪击了！’和‘抓住他，抓住他，别让他走！’”两名警察抓住了一名试图逃跑的黑人的手臂。警察朝空中开了一枪，将这名男子推进他们的警车，不希望愤怒的人群靠近，然后迅速将他送往警察局。
Someone had run up to the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital's Vanderbilt Clinic emergencyentrance at 167th Street and grabbed a poles-and-canvas stretcher and brought it back to theAudubon Ballroom stage. Malcolm X was put on the stretcher and an unidentified photographergot a macabre picture of him, with his mouth open and his teeth bared, as men rushed him up tothe hospital clinic emergency entrance. A hospital spokesman said later that it was about 3:15P.M. when Malcolm X reached a third-floor operating room. He was "either dead, or in a death- appearing state," said the spokesman. 
有人跑到哥伦比亚长老会医院范德比尔特诊所的紧急入口处,在167街,抓住一个帆布担架,把它带回到奥杜邦舞厅的舞台上。马尔科姆X被放在担架上,一个不知名的摄影师拍到了一张他恐怖的照片,他的嘴张着,牙齿露在外面,当人们冲他上医院诊所的紧急入口。医院发言人后来表示,马尔科姆X到达三楼手术室的时间大约是下午3点15分。他说:“他要么死了,要么处于看起来像死的状态。”
A team of surgeons cut through his chest to attempt to massage the heart. The effort wasabandoned at 3:30 P.M. 
一组外科医生切开他的胸膛试图按摩心脏。到下午3点半时，这个努力已经放弃。
Reporters who had descended upon the hospital office fired questions at the spokesman, whokept saying brusquely, "I don't know." Then he took the elevator upstairs to the emergencyoperating room. A small crowd of friends and Sister Betty had also pushed into the hospital officewhen the hospital spokesman returned. Collecting himself, he made an announcement: "Thegentleman you know as Malcolm X is dead. He died from gunshot wounds. He was apparentlydead before he got here. He was shot in the chest several times, and once in the cheek." 
一群记者涌到医院办公室，向发言人提问，他只是冷冷地说：“我不知道。”然后乘电梯上楼，到了急救手术室。当医院发言人回来时，一群朋友和贝蒂修女也挤进了医院办公室。他镇定了一下，宣布说：“你们认识的马尔科姆·X先生已经死了。他是死于枪伤。他到这里时显然已经死了。他胸部中了数枪，脸颊上也中了一枪。”
The group filed out of the hospital office. The Negro men were visibly fighting their emotions; onekept smashing his fist into the other cupped palm. Among the women, many were openly crying. 
一群人走出医院办公室。黑人男子明显在抑制自己的情绪；其中一人不断用拳头砸向另一只握紧的手掌。在妇女中，许多人公然哭泣。
Moments after the news flashed throughout Harlem (and throughout the entire world), a crowdbegan to gather outside the Hotel Theresa where Malcolm X'sOAAU had its headquarters. Theylearned over transistor radios that the man whom the two policemen had taken from the murderscene initially identified himself as Thomas Hagan, 22 (he was later identified as TalmadgeHayer), in whose right trousers pocket the policemen had found a .45 caliber cartridge clipcontaining four unused cartridges, and then at Jewish Memorial Hospital doctors had reportedthat Hayer had been shot in the left thigh, his forehead was bruised and his body was beaten. "Ifwe hadn't gotten him away, they would have kicked him to death," Sergeant Aronoff had said, andHayer had been taken to the Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward. By five P.M. , the crowd in front ofthe Theresa Hotel had been quietly, carefully dispersed, and the Black Muslim Mosque Number 7and its restaurant around the corner, at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, had been ordered closedas a precautionary measure, on the orders of the local 28th Precinct's Captain Lloyd Sealy, NewYork City's first Negro to command a precinct. When reporters telephoned the Black Muslimrestaurant, a man's voice stated, "No one is available to make any statement." When the OAAUoffice in the Theresa Hotel was tried, the telephone kept ringing, unanswered. Precinct CaptainSealy soon appeared, walking by himself along 125th Street, swinging his nightstick andconversing with people he met. 
消息传遍哈莱姆区（以及整个世界）后不久，一群人开始聚集在特蕾莎酒店外，马尔科姆X的OAAU总部就在那里。他们通过晶体管无线电获悉，两名警察从谋杀现场带走的男子最初自称是 22 岁的托马斯·哈根（他后来被确认为 TalmadgeHayer），警察在他的右裤口袋里发现了一个 .45 口径的弹药筒夹，里面有四个未使用的弹药筒，然后在犹太纪念医院，医生报告说，Hayer 的左大腿中弹， 他的额头有瘀伤，身体被殴打。“如果我们没有把他弄走，他们就会把他踢死，”阿罗诺夫警官说，海耶已经被送往贝尔维尤医院的监狱病房。到下午五点，特蕾莎酒店前的人群已经被悄悄地、小心地驱散，而位于116街和莱诺克斯大道拐角处的7号黑人穆斯林清真寺及其餐厅也被下令关闭，这是一项预防措施，是当地第28分局的劳埃德·西利上尉下达的命令，他是纽约市第一个指挥一个分局的黑人。当记者致电这家黑人穆斯林餐厅时，一个男人的声音说：“没有人可以发表任何声明。”当记者致电特蕾莎酒店的OAAU办公室时，电话一直响个不停，无人接听。警区队长西利很快就出现了，他独自沿着第125街走着，挥舞着警棍，与他遇到的人交谈。
At the 28th Precinct station house on West 123rd Street, the forty policemen who were to havegone off duty at four P.M. had been told they must remain on duty, and two full busloads of thehighly trained New York City Police Tactical Patrol Force had arrived at the precinct. Various highpolice officials made press statements. A Tactical Patrol Force Captain, Harry Kaiser, said nounusual occurrences had been noted, and he anticipated no trouble. Deputy PoliceCommissioner Walter Arm said that "hundreds" of extra policemen would be put into the Harlemarea, including some members of the Bureau of Special Services. An Assistant Chief Inspector,Harry Taylor, speculated that the assassins had not rushed from the ballroom among the crowd,but had kept running past the stage and escaped on 165th Street. In the early evening, thepolicedepartment's Chief of Detectives Philip J. Walsh quit a vacation he was on to join the hunt for thekillers, and he said he looked forward to "a long-drawn-out investigation." Police and reporters atthe shooting scene had pictures taken of the stage, with white chalk marks now circling five bulletholes in the speaker's stand; there were other holes in the stage's mural backdrop, indicatingslugs or shotgun pellets which had either missed Malcolm X or passed through him. Policedeclined to discuss a rumor sweeping Harlem that they had some motion pictures which hadbeen taken in the Audubon Ballroom as the murder took place. Another rumor that gained swiftmomentum was that when Sister Betty had leaned over her husband's body, she had removedfrom his coat pocket a paper on which he had written the names of those he had supposedlylearned were assigned to execute him. 
在西123街的第28警察分局，原本四点下班的四十名警察被告知必须继续值勤，两辆满载训练有素的纽约市警察战术巡逻部队的巴士抵达分局。多位高级警官发表了新闻声明。战术巡逻部队队长哈利·凯撒表示，没有注意到任何不寻常的情况，他预计不会有任何麻烦。副警察专员沃尔特·阿姆表示，将在哈莱姆地区部署“数百”名额外警察，其中包括一些特别服务局的成员。助理首席检查官哈里·泰勒推测，刺客没有在人群中从舞厅冲出来，而是从舞台上跑过去，然后逃到了165街。傍晚早些时候，警察局的侦探长菲利普·J·沃尔什放弃了正在度的假期，加入追捕杀手的行动。他说，他期待“一场漫长而复杂的调查”。警察和记者们在枪击现场拍摄了舞台的照片，白色的粉笔圈现在围绕着演讲台上的五个弹孔；舞台的壁画背景上还有其他弹孔，表明子弹或霰弹枪的弹丸要么没有击中马尔科姆·X，要么穿过了他。警方拒绝讨论在哈莱姆区流传的一个谣言，即他们有一些在奥杜邦礼堂拍摄的录像，记录了谋杀案发生时的情况。另一个迅速传播的谣言是，当贝蒂修女俯身在丈夫的尸体上时，她从他的外套口袋里取出了一张纸，纸上写着她丈夫据说知道的那些被指派要杀他的人的名字。
Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm stressed that the department had made efforts toprotect Malcolm X. Twenty different times the department had offered protection to Malcolm X orto some of his assistants, and the protection was refused, said Commissioner Arm, andseventeen times uniformed police guards had been offered for the OAAU meetings at theAudubon Ballroom, the most recent time being "last Sunday." Asked about the pistol permit thatMalcolm X had said publicly he planned to request, Commissioner Arm said that as far as heknew, Malcolm X had never actually filed a request. 
副警政委员沃尔特·阿姆强调说,警察部门曾努力保护马尔科姆·X。阿姆委员说,警政部门曾20次主动提出保护马尔科姆·X或他的某些助手,但都被拒绝了。他说,警政部门曾17次主动提出派武装警察在奥阿奥会议厅为奥阿奥会议站岗,最近一次是“上星期天”。当被问及马尔科姆·X公开说他打算申请手枪许可证时,阿姆委员说,据他所知,马尔科姆·X从未正式提出过申请。
A number of questions have been raised. The "suspect" arrested by Patrolman Hoy as he wasbeing chased from the meeting has, at present writing, not been identified publicly. Deputy PoliceCommissioner Walter Arm's statement that Malcolm X refused police protection conflicts directlywith the statements of many of his associates that during the week preceding his assassinationMalcolm X complained repeatedly that the police would not take his requests for protectionseriously. Finally, although police sources said that a special detail of twenty men had beenassigned to the meeting and that it had even been attended by agents of the Bureau of SpecialServices, these men were nowherein evidence during or after the assassination, and TalmadgeHayer, rescued from the crowd and arrested as a suspect immediately after the assassination,was picked up by two patrolmen in a squad car cruising by. 
有几个问题已经提出。巡逻警察霍伊逮捕的“嫌疑犯”在会议结束后被追捕，目前尚未公开身份。副警察局长沃尔特·阿姆斯的声明说马尔科姆·X拒绝警方保护，与他许多同事的声明直接冲突，这些同事说在暗杀前一周，马尔科姆·X反复抱怨警方不认真对待他的保护请求。最后，尽管警方消息人士说，已派出二十人的特别小组参加这次会议，甚至有特别服务局的特工出席，但在暗杀期间和之后，这些人都没有出现，塔尔马吉·海耶从人群中被救出，暗杀后立即被捕为嫌疑人，是由一辆巡逻车巡逻的两名巡逻员捡到的。
On long-distance telephones, reporters reached the Chicago mansion headquarters of ElijahMuhammad. He would not come to the telephone, but a spokesman of his said that Muhammad"has no comment today, but he might have something to say tomorrow." No statement could beobtained either from Malcolm X's oldest brother, Wilfred X, the Black Muslim minister of MosqueNumber 1 in Detroit. At his home, a woman told reporters that Minister Wilfred X was not there,that he had not gone to New York, and she didn't believe he had any plans to do so. (MinisterWilfred X, reached later, said that he anticipated attending the Black Muslim convention inChicago on the following Sunday, and regarding his brother, "My brother is dead and there isnothing we can do to bring him back.") 
在长途电话中，记者们接通了芝加哥穆罕默德府邸的总部。他不愿来接电话，但他的一个发言人说，穆罕默德“今天没有评论，但他明天可能会有话要说。”同样，记者也无法从马尔科姆·X的哥哥威尔弗雷德·X那里得到任何声明，他是底特律第一清真寺的黑人穆斯林牧师。在他的家中，一名女子告诉记者，牧师威尔弗雷德·X不在家，他没有去纽约，她不相信他有任何打算去纽约。后来联系到的牧师威尔弗雷德·X说，他预计将在接下来的周日参加芝加哥的黑人穆斯林大会，并且关于他的弟弟，“我弟弟已经死了，我们无法让他回来。”
As dark fell, many Negro men and women assembled before Louis Michaux's bookstore, wheremost of Harlem's Black Nationalist public activity centered. A small group of OAAU membersopened their Hotel Theresa headquarters and sat in the room and would not make anystatements to reporters. 
天黑后，许多黑人男女聚集在路易斯·米肖克斯的书店前，哈莱姆的大部分黑人民族主义公共活动都集中在这里。一个小群OAAU成员打开他们在瑟瑟萨酒店的总部，坐在房间里，不愿对记者发表任何声明。
The New York _Daily News_ came onto the newsstands with its cover page devoted to "MalcolmX Murdered" over the photograph of him being borne away on the stretcher, and a sub-caption,"Gunned Down at Rally." In Long Island, where she had been taken just after her father's murder,six-year-old At-tallah carefully wrote a letter to him, "Dear Daddy, I love you so. O dear, O dear, Iwish you wasn't dead." 
《纽约每日新闻》用其封面报道了"MalcolmX被谋杀"，照片中他被担架抬走，副标题是"在集会上被枪杀"。在她父亲被谋杀后，被带到长岛的六岁At-tallah小心地给他写了一封信，"亲爱的爸爸，我非常爱你。哦，亲爱的，亲爱的，我希望你没死。"

The body-still listed as "John Doe" because it had not yet been formally identified-had beenmoved late Sunday to the New York City Medical Examiner's office at 520 First Avenue. Theautopsy confirmed that shotgun pellet wounds in the heart had killed Malcolm X. Chief MedicalExaminer Dr. Milton Helpern said that death followed the first sawed-off shotgun blast whichcaused thirteen wounds in the heart and chest, and he said that .38 and .45 caliber bullet woundsin the thighs and legs evidenced that Malcolm X had been shot at after he had fallen. Mondaymorning the official identification was made at the Medical Examiner's office by Sister Betty, whowas accompanied by Percy Sutton, Malcolm X's Boston half-sister Mrs. Ella Collins, and JosephE. Hall, General Manager of the large Unity Funeral Home in Harlem. Leaving the MedicalExaminer's office at about noon to go and complete funeral arrangements, Sister Betty toldreporters, "No one believed what he said. They never took him seriously, even after the bombingof our home they said he did it himself!" 
尸体仍被列为"约翰·多伊"，因为还没有正式确认身份。尸体于周日晚上被送往位于第一大道520号的纽约市法医办公室。尸检确认，心脏上的猎枪霰弹伤导致了马尔科姆·X的死亡。首席法医米尔顿·赫尔芬博士说，死亡是由于第一颗锯短猎枪的爆炸造成的，这次爆炸造成心脏和胸部的十三处伤口，他说，大腿和腿部的.38和.45口径子弹伤表明马尔科姆·X在倒下后被射杀。周一上午，贝蒂修女在法医办公室正式确认了身份，她陪同珀西·萨顿（Malcolm X的波士顿异母妹妹埃拉·柯林斯夫人）和哈莱姆大型团结殡仪馆的总经理约瑟夫·E·霍尔。贝蒂修女中午离开法医办公室去完成葬礼安排时对记者说："没有人相信他说的话。他们从不把他当回事，即使在我们的家被炸后，他们还说这是他自己干的！"
At the Unity Funeral Home on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 126th and 127th Streets,Sister Betty chose a six-foot-nine-inch bronze casket lined with egg-shell velvet. At her request,the funeral would be delayed until the following Saturday, five days away. The funeral home'smanager Hall announced to the press that the body would be dressed in a business suit, and itwould be put on view under a glass shield from Tuesday through Friday, then the Saturdayservices would be at a Harlem church. 
在第八大道东侧126街和127街之间的联合殡仪馆,贝蒂修女选择了一个六英尺九英寸的青铜棺材,里面铺着蛋壳色的天鹅绒。根据她的要求,葬礼将推迟到接下来的周六,还有五天。殡仪馆经理霍尔向媒体宣布,尸体将穿着一套商务套装,并将从周二到周五展示在玻璃防护罩下,然后周六的葬礼将在哈莱姆区的一个教堂举行。
Soon posted on the funeral home's directory was "El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz." In Brooklyn,orthodox Moslem Sheik Al-Hajh Daoud Ahmed Faisal of the Islamic Mission of America said thatthe delayed funeral services violated a Moslem practice that the sun should not set twice on abeliever's body, that the Koran prescribed burial inside twenty-four hours if possible, and Moslemsbelieved that when a body grows cold the soul leaves it and when the body is put into the earth itcomes alive again.In Chicago, where policemen were watching all bus depots, railways,terminals, O'Hare Airport and highway entrances, Elijah Muhammad, under heavy guard in histhree-story mansion, said, "Malcolm died according to his preaching. He seems to have takenweapons as his god. Therefore, we couldn't tolerate a man like that. He preached war. We preachpeace. We are permitted to fight if we are attacked-that's the Scripture, the Koran, and the Bible,too. But we will never be the aggressor. I don't have the right to be frightened, because I waschosen by Allah. If Allah gives me up to the hands of the wicked, I am satisfied. My life is in thehands of Allah." The grounds outside the mansion were patrolled by both Chicago police and Fruitof Islam bodyguards. More of both patrolled before the University of Islam high school, and theoffices of the newspaper _Muhammad Speaks_. 
不久后，殡仪馆的名录上写着“El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz”。在布鲁克林，美国伊斯兰使团的正统穆斯林谢赫阿卜杜勒·哈基姆·达乌德·艾哈迈德·法伊萨尔说，延迟的葬礼服务违反了穆斯林的习俗，即太阳不应该两次落下在一个信徒的身上，古兰经规定如果可能的话，应该在24小时内埋葬，穆斯林相信，当身体变冷时，灵魂就会离开，当身体被放入土地时，它就会复活。 在芝加哥，警察在监视所有的公共汽车站、铁路、终点站、奥黑尔机场和高速公路入口，伊利亚·穆罕默德在他的三层豪宅中，受到严密的保护，他说：“马尔科姆按照他的布道死去。他似乎把武器当作他的神。因此，我们不能容忍像他这样的人。他布道战争。我们布道和平。如果我们被攻击，我们被允许战斗——这是《圣经》、《古兰经》和《圣经》的规定。但我们永远不会是侵略者。我没有权利害怕，因为我是被真主选中的。如果真主把我交给恶人，我满足了。我的生命掌握在真主手中。”豪宅外的场地由芝加哥警察和水果伊斯兰教的保镖巡逻。他们更多的人在伊斯兰大学高中和《穆罕默德讲话》报的办公室巡逻。
Malcolm X's lawyer, Assemblyman Percy Sutton, said that the police now had the names of thosewhom Malcolm X had said planned to kill him. All over Harlem, reporters were interviewingpeople, and microphones were being put before the mouths of the man-in-the-street. At policeprecinct station houses, people being questioned were leaving by side entrances. Said AssistantChief Inspector Joseph Coyle, in charge of Manhattan North detectives, ". . . . a well-plannedconspiracy. We're doing a screening process of the four hundred people who were in the hall atthe time." Fifty detectives were on the case, he said, and he had been in touch with police in othercities. 
马尔科姆·X的律师、州议员珀西·萨顿说，警察现在已掌握了马尔科姆·X所说的那些计划杀他的人的名字。在整个哈莱姆区，记者们都在采访人们，麦克风被放在街头的人们的嘴边。在警察分局，接受询问的人们从侧门离开。负责曼哈顿北区侦探的助理警长约瑟夫·科伊尔说：“……一个精心策划的阴谋。我们正在对当时在大厅里的400人进行筛选。”他说，有50名侦探在调查此案，他已与其它城市的警察取得了联系。
Harlem was mostly asleep when around the Black Muslim Mosque Number 7, on the top floor ofa four-story building at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, an explosive sound at 2:15 A.M. rippedthe night. Firemen were instantly summoned by the four policemen who had been guarding thesidewalk entrance to the mosque. Within a few minutes flames burst through the building's roofand leaped thirty feet into the air. For the next seven hours firemen would pour water into thebuilding. On an adjacent roof they found an empty five-gallongasoline can, a brown, gasoline- stained shopping bag, and oily rags. Southbound IRT subway service was re-routed for a while,also three bus lines. At the spectacular five-alarm fire's height, a wall of the building collapsed; itsmashed two fire engines at the curb and injured five firemen, one seriously, and also apedestrian who had been across the street buying a newspaper. By daybreak, when the fire wasdeclared "under control," the Black Muslim mosque and the Gethsemane Church of God in Christon the floor beneath it were gutted, and seven street-level stores, including the Black Muslimrestaurant, were "total losses." Fire Department sources said that replacing the ruined equipmentwould cost "around $50,000." Joseph X of the Black Muslims, who once had been the immediateassistant of Malcolm X, said that Elijah Muhammad's followers had two alternative mosques tomeet in, one in Brooklyn and the other in Queens, Long Island. Both these mosques were undercontinuous police guard. 
哈莱姆区大部分居民还在沉睡的时候，凌晨2点15分，位于Lenox大道116街的黑人穆斯林清真寺7号，楼顶发生爆炸，撕裂了夜晚。正在清真寺门口值勤的四名警察立刻召唤消防员。几分钟后，火焰从屋顶喷出，直冲云霄，达30英尺。接下来的七个小时里，消防员用水灌救这座建筑。他们在相邻的屋顶上发现了一个空的五加仑汽油罐，一个沾满汽油的棕色购物袋和油腻的抹布。南行的IRT地铁服务暂时改道，三条公交线路也受到影响。在大火的壮观景象中，清真寺的一堵墙倒塌，砸坏了停在路边的两辆消防车，导致五名消防员受伤，其中一人重伤，还有一名在街对面买报纸的行人受伤。当火势被宣布“得到控制”时，黎明时分，黑人穆斯林清真寺和其下方的耶稣受难教堂被烧得面目全非，七家临街商店，包括黑人穆斯林餐厅，被“完全摧毁”。消防部门的消息人士说，更换损坏的设备将花费“大约5万美元”。黑人穆斯林的约瑟夫X曾是马尔科姆X的直接助手，他说，埃利亚·穆罕默德的信徒有两个可供集会的备选清真寺，一个在布鲁克林，另一个在长岛的皇后区。这两座清真寺都受到警方的严密保护。
Across the nation in San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon two policemen discovered a firebeginning in the San Francisco Black Muslim Mosque, and quickly extinguished it. Kerosene hadbeen splashed on the sidewalk and door and set afire. 
星期二下午,全国范围内的旧金山市,两名警察发现圣弗朗西斯科黑人穆斯林清真寺起火,并迅速将其扑灭。在人行道和门上泼洒了煤油并点燃了火。
The body of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz originally had been scheduled to go on public view at 2:30P.M. Tuesday. Crowds stood in line behind police barricades waiting to be admitted and thepolicemen wherever one looked included numerous patrol cars and even sharpshooters on theroofs around the Unity Funeral Home. But the telephoned bomb-threats which had begun shortlyafter noon made necessary two evacuations of the funeral home for bornb-squad searches,which proved futile. A search was conducted even in the 43rd Street offices of the _New YorkTimes_ after a man telephoned complaining of an editorial about Malcolm X and said, "Your plantwill be destroyed at four o'clock." 
艾尔-哈吉·马利克·艾尔-沙巴兹的尸体原定于星期二下午2时30分公开展出。人群在警察封锁线后排队等候入场，无论你走到哪里，警察都包括许多巡逻车，甚至在Unity殡仪馆周围的屋顶上有狙击手。但午后不久就开始的电话炸弹威胁，使得殡仪馆两次疏散，以便进行炸弹小组的搜查，但都无济于事。一名男子打电话抱怨一篇关于马尔科姆·X的社论，并说：“你的工厂将在四点钟被摧毁。”之后，甚至在《纽约时报》在43街的办公室进行了搜查。
 At the funeral home in Harlem, policemen inspected all packages and floral pieces beingdelivered, as well as the large handbags of women mourners. It was 6:15 P.M. when a cordon ofpolicemen arrived flanking Sister Betty and four close relatives and friends who entered thefuneral home in a glare of flashbulbs. "She's a black Jacqueline Kennedy," observed a whitereporter. "She has class, she knows what to do and when, she handles herself beautifully." 
在哈林区的殡仪馆,警察检查了所有送来的包裹和花圈,还有妇女哀悼者的大手提包。 下午6点15分,一队警察来到殡仪馆,簇拥着贝蒂修女和她的四个亲近的亲戚朋友。闪光灯闪烁着,他们走进殡仪馆。 “她就像个黑人杰奎琳·肯尼迪。”一位白人记者说,“她有风度,知道何时该做什么,而且举止得体。”
It was 7:10 P.M. when the family party emerged and left. After ten minutes, the first of the waitingpublic was admitted. Between then and an hour before midnight, two thousand people, includingscores of whites, had filed past the open coffin in which the body lay dressed in a dark businesssuit, a white shirt and dark tie, with a small, oblong brass plate above it inscribed, 
下午7时10分,葬礼家庭成员离开。10分钟后,第一批等候的公众获准进入。从那时起到午夜前一小时,已有两千人,包括很多白人,瞻仰了那具躺在敞开的棺材里的尸体。尸体穿着深色的西装、白衬衫和深色领带,上面放着一块小小的长方形黄铜牌,上面刻着:
"El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz-May 19, 1925-Feb. 21, 1965." 
埃尔-哈吉·马利克·阿尔-沙巴兹，1925年5月19日-1965年2月21日。

Malcolm X followers had been canvassing with growing anxiety for a Harlem church that wouldaccept the Saturday funeral. Officials of several churches had refused, including a spokesman forthe community's largest church, Abyssinian Baptist, of which Congressman-Reverend AdamClayton Powell is the pastor; others which turned down requests, according to the _AmsterdamNews_, included the Williams C.M.E. Church and The Refuge Temple of The Church of Our LordJesus Christ. Then the funeral was accepted by Bishop Alvin A. Childs for the Faith Temple,Church of God in Christ located at 147th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The Faith Temple, aformer movie theater which had been converted fifteen years previously, could seat a thousand inits auditorium and another seven hundred in its basement. Bishop Childs, who in 1964 had beenelected as Harlem's "locality mayor," told the press that it was "as a humanitarian gesture" that hemade his church available, and of Malcolm X,he said, ". . .a militant and vocal person. I did notagree with all of his philosophy, but this did not affect our friendship." Shortly after the newsbecame known, Bishop Childs and his wife began to receive the first of a succession of bombthreats telephoned both to the church and to their home. 
马尔科姆X的信徒们一直在焦虑地寻找一个接受周六葬礼的哈莱姆教堂。几家教堂的官员都拒绝了，包括社区最大的教堂阿比西尼亚浸信会的发言人，该教堂的牧师是国会议员-牧师亚当·克莱顿·鲍威尔；根据《阿姆斯特丹新闻》报道，其他拒绝请求的教堂包括威廉姆斯C.M.E.教堂和我们的主耶稣基督教堂的避难所神庙。然后，葬礼被阿尔文·A·儿童主教接受，地点是位于147街和阿姆斯特丹大道的上帝在基督中的信仰庙。信仰庙是一个前电影院，15年前被改造成一个可以容纳1000人的礼堂和700人的地下室。1964年当选为哈莱姆“地方市长”的主教Childs告诉媒体，他出于“人道主义姿态”将他的教堂提供出来，并说：“马尔科姆X是一个激进且直言不讳的人。我并不赞同他所有的哲学，但这并不影响我们的友谊。”消息传开后不久，主教Childs和他的妻子开始收到一系列炸弹威胁的电话，电话打到了教堂和他们的家。
Prominent Negro figures were being quoted by the various press media. The famed psychologistDr. Kenneth B. Clark told _Jet_ magazine, "I had a deep respect for this man. I believe that hewas sincerely groping to find a place in the fight for Civil Rights, on a level where he would berespected and understood fully. I looked forward to his growth along those lines. It doesn't matterso much about his past. It is tragic that he was cut down at the point when he seemed on theverge of achieving the position of respectability he sought." A _New York Times_ correspondent ina London press conference quoted the author and dramatist James Baldwin, who thought thedeath of Malcolm X was "a major setback for the Negro movement." Pointing at white reporters,Baldwin accused, "You did it. . . whoever did it was formed in the crucible of the Western world, ofthe American Republic!" European "rape" of Africa began racial problems and was therefore thebeginning of the end for Malcolm X, Baldwin said. 
在各种新闻媒体上，一些著名的黑人人物被引用。著名的心理学家肯尼思·克拉克博士告诉《Jet》杂志说：“我对这个人有着深深的敬意。我相信他真诚地在寻找一个位置，以便在争取民权的斗争中，他能够得到充分的尊重和理解。我期待他在这些方面的发展。他的过去并不重要。他在这个似乎即将获得他所寻求的尊重地位的时刻被杀害，这是悲剧。”《纽约时报》的一名记者引用了戏剧家詹姆斯·鲍德温的话，他在伦敦的一次新闻发布会上说，马尔科姆·X的死“对黑人运动是一个重大的挫折”。鲍德温指着白人记者说：“是你干的……不管是谁干的，他都是在西方世界、美国共和国的熔炉中形成的！”欧洲对非洲的“强奸”开始了种族问题，因此对马尔科姆·X来说，这是结束的开始，鲍德温说。
The bookstore owner in Harlem, Louis Michaux, a major voice in t he community, told the_Amsterdam News_, "It's things like the murder of Malcolm X that drive the masses closertogether. He died in the same manner that Patrice Lumumba met his death in the Congo. . . . Wemust unite, not fight." 
哈莱姆区的书店老板路易斯·米肖是社区里的主要声音，他告诉《阿姆斯特丹新闻》：“像马尔科姆·X被谋杀这样的事情使大众更加团结。他死的方式与刚果的帕特里斯·卢蒙巴的死相似。……我们必须团结，而不是战斗。”
"Malcolm X caused many young Negroes to take a new vision of themselves," said BayardRustin, a main figure in organizing the March on Washington in 1963. A "third party" wassuspected of killing Malcolm X by CORE'S National Director James Farmer, who said, "Malcolm'smurder was calculated to produce more violence and murder and vengeance killings." A few dayslater, asked for his opinion of a rumor circulating about that a "Red Chinese" plot broughtaboutthe murder, Farmer said, "I would not say it is impossible." 
"马尔科姆·X使许多年轻的黑人对自己的看法有了新的认识,"1963年华盛顿游行的主要组织者贝亚德·拉斯丁说。" CORE的全国主任詹姆斯·法默怀疑一个"第三方"杀死了马尔科姆·X,他说, "马尔科姆的被杀是经过精心策划的,目的是引发更多的暴力、谋杀和复仇杀人。"几天后,当被问及他对一个关于"红色中国人"阴谋导致马尔科姆·X被杀的谣言的看法时,法默说, "我不排除这种可能性。"
"For the Negroes in America, the death of Malcolm X is the most portentous event since thedeportation of Marcus Garvey in the 1920's," said Dr. C. Eric Lincoln, author of _The BlackMuslims in America_, who talked to the press at Brown University in Providence, R.I., where hewas a visiting professor and research fellow. "I doubt there are 'international implications' in theslaying. The answer is closer to home. The answer is in the local struggle among contendingrivals for leadership of the black masses, which are potentially the most volatile sub-group inAmerica." Said Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the National Association for the Advancementof Colored People, "Master spell-binder that he was, Malcolm X in death cast a spell more far- flung and more disturbing than any he cast in life." 
"对于美国的黑人来说，马尔科姆·X的死是自1920年代马库斯·加维被驱逐以来最重要的事件，"《美国黑人穆斯林》一书的作者C.埃里克·林肯博士在罗德岛布朗大学接受采访时说，他是该校的访问教授和研究员。"我怀疑这次谋杀案有‘国际影响’。答案更接近我们自己。答案在于当地争夺黑人群众领导权的竞争对手之间的斗争，他们可能是美国最易激动的次级群体。"美国有色人种协进会执行秘书罗伊·威尔金斯说："马尔科姆·X是一位出色的说客，他的死比他在世时更深远、更令人不安。"
The New York City police investigators who were pursuing the case were unhappy that Malcolm'sfollowers had "not come forward" to aid the investigation. At police request, the press printed atelephone number, SW 5-8 117, for "strictly confidential" information that anyone might offerconcerning the slaying. The police had picked up and were holding Reuben Francis, described asa Malcolm X "bodyguard," who was believed to be the person who had shot the suspectedassassin Talmadge Hayer during the melee the previous Sunday at the Audubon Ballroom. Hayerremained in the Bellevue Prison Ward, awaiting surgery. 
纽约市警局的调查人员对马尔科姆的追随者"没有站出来"协助调查感到不满。警方要求媒体公布一个电话号码SW 5-8 117，以便人们可以提供有关此案的"严格保密"信息。警方已经逮捕并拘留了鲁本·弗朗西斯，他被描述为马尔科姆·X的"保镖"，被认为是上星期天在奥杜邦礼堂的混战中开枪打伤了嫌疑凶手塔尔马吉·海耶的人。海耶仍在贝尔维尤监狱病房等待手术。
As thousands continued viewing the body of the slain Malcolm X amid intermittent new bomb- threats telephoned to the funeral home, and to the Faith Temple where his funeral was scheduledfor Saturday, a new organization, the Federation of Independent Political Action, threatened topicket all Harlem business establishments which would not close from Thursday afternoon untilMonday morning "in tribute to Malcolm X." The FIPA's spokesman was Jesse Gray, the well- known rent-strike leader; Harlem pedestrians began to behanded printed sheets reading, in part,"If the stores refuse to close, they identify with our enemy-therefore we must close them-passthem by. Those that shop along 125th Street during the hours that the stores are to be closedidentify with the murderous stooge that allowed the power structure to use his hands to killBrother Malcolm." At a late evening FIPA rally before Louis Mi-chaux's bookstore, Jesse Graydeclared that in 1965 a Negro should run for Mayor of New York "in the name of Malcolm," andspeculated that such a candidate should receive 100,000 votes. Shortly after the FIPA rally,merchants and other members of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce met and swiftly passed aresolution urging all Harlem stores to remain open and "continue to serve their customers," andrecommendation was made that full pay be given to any store employees who might wish toattend Malcolm X's funeral on Saturday morning. Then one after another, Harlem leaders sharplycriticized the FIPA proposal as "irresponsible." Finally, nearly all of the Harlem stores kept theirdoors open for business. The FIPA got together about twenty pickets who patrolled for a whilebefore Harlem's largest store, Blumstein's; leading the pickets were two white men carrying signsreading "All Stores Should Close. Honor Malcolm X." 
当成千上万的人继续在殡仪馆观看被杀的马尔科姆·X的尸体时，殡仪馆和他预定于周六举行的葬礼的Faith Temple不断接到新的炸弹威胁电话。一个新的组织，独立政治行动联合会，威胁要从周四下午到周一早上在哈莱姆区所有不关门的商业场所前举行抗议游行，以“向马尔科姆·X致敬”。该组织的发言人是著名租金罢工领袖杰西·格雷，哈莱姆区的行人开始被分发印有部分文字的传单：“如果商店拒绝关门，他们就是与我们的敌人站在一起，因此我们必须关闭它们，不要经过它们。那些在商店应该关门的时间在125街购物的人就是与允许权力结构使用他的手杀死马尔科姆兄弟的杀人凶手站在一起。”在晚上晚些时候在路易·米肖书店举行的FIPA集会上，杰西·格雷宣布，1965年，一名黑人应该以马尔科姆的名字竞选纽约市长，并推测这样的候选人应该获得10万张选票。FIPA集会后不久，商界人士和其他成员在上城区商会开会，迅速通过了一项决议，敦促哈莱姆区的所有商店保持开放，并“继续为他们的顾客服务”，并建议在周六上午参加马尔科姆·X的葬礼的任何商店员工应得到全额工资。然后，一个接一个，哈莱姆区的领导人尖锐地批评了FIPA的提议，称其“不负责任”。最后，几乎所有的哈莱姆区商店都开门营业。FIPA组织了大约二十名示威者，在哈莱姆区最大的商店Blumstein's门前巡逻了一会儿；带领示威者的是两名手持“所有商店都应关闭。向马尔科姆·X致敬”的标语的白人男子。
The weather had turned very cold. Icicles hung from the collapsed roof of the fire-ruined buildingthat had housed Black 
天气变得非常冷。曾经是布莱克的家的那座被大火烧毁的建筑的倒塌的屋顶上挂着冰柱。
Muslim Mosque Number 7. The _Amsterdam News_, its offices barely a block down EighthAvenue from the funeral home where Malcolm X's body lay, editorialized, "Steady, Eddie!" sayingthat orderly tributes to Malcolm X would "confound his critics, who would like nothing better thanto see black people rioting over his remains." 
穆斯林清真寺第七号。《阿姆斯特丹新闻》（The Amsterdam News）就在离殡仪馆只有一条街的地方，它的办公室就在八号大街上，该报编辑部说：“稳住，埃迪！”（Steady, Eddie!）他们说，有序的对马尔科姆·X的悼念将“使他的批评者感到困惑，他们最希望看到的就是黑人因他的遗体而骚乱。”
The fear of serious mass rioting set off by some unpredictable spark hung steadily in the air. Anincreasing number of Harlem leaders declared that the principal reason for this was thedowntown white press media, sensationalizing whatwas going on in a calm, dignified community.Finally the Harlem Ministers' Interfaith Association would issue a formal accusation: "Thescreaming headlines of many of our newspapers make it seem as if all of Harlem was an armedcamp, ready to explode at any moment. The vast majority of the citizens of the Harlemcommunity is not involved in the unfortunate acts of violence that have been grossly overplayedby the press. Many times the slanting of the news is able to bring about an atmosphere throughwhich a few depraved and reckless individuals can take advantage." 
对一些无法预见的火花引发严重骚乱的恐惧稳定地悬在空中。越来越多的哈莱姆领导人宣称，这主要是因为市区的白人新闻媒体，对一个平静而有尊严的社区发生的事情进行耸人听闻的报道。最后，哈莱姆牧师协会将正式提出指控：“我们许多报纸的尖叫标题让人觉得整个哈莱姆区都是一座武装营地，随时可能爆炸。哈莱姆区的绝大多数居民并没有参与不幸的暴力行为，而这些行为被新闻界过分夸大。新闻的倾向性报道常常能够营造出一种气氛，让一些堕落和鲁莽的个人从中得利。”
"_Malcolm X Died Broke_"-that headline in Harlem's _Amsterdam News_ came as a shock tomany in the community. Few had reflected that Malcolm X, upon becoming a Black Muslimminister, had signed an oath of poverty, so that for twelve years he never acquired anything in hisown name. (Somewhere I have read that Malcolm X in his Black Muslim days received about$175 weekly to cover his living and other expenses exclusive of travel.) "He left his four daughtersand pregnant wife with no insurance of any kind, no savings, and no income," the _AmsterdamNews_ story said (and it might have added that he never drew up a will; he had made a February26th appointment with his lawyer-five days after his death). Within the week, two groups hadorganized and were asking Harlemites for contributions to help Sister Betty raise and educate thechildren (since organized as the Malcolm X Daughters' Fund at Harlem's Freedom National Bank,275 West 125th Street). 
"马尔科姆·X死时身无分文"——哈莱姆《阿姆斯特丹新闻》上的这个标题让社区里的许多人感到震惊。很少有人会想到，马尔科姆·X在成为黑人穆斯林牧师时，签署了一份贫困誓言，因此十二年来他从未以自己的名义获得任何东西。（我记得在某个地方读到过，马尔科姆·X在当黑人穆斯林的时候，每周能拿到大约175美元，用来支付生活和其他费用，不包括旅行。）《阿姆斯特丹新闻》的故事说（它可能还会补充说，他从未立过遗嘱；他在死前五天，也就是2月26日，与他的律师约了会）。一周之内，两个组织就已经成立，并向哈莱姆人募捐，帮助贝蒂姐妹抚养和教育孩子们（他们后来被组织为哈莱姆自由国家银行的马尔科姆·X女儿基金，地址是西125街275号）。
In Boston, Malcolm X's half-sister, Mrs. Ella Mae Collins, told a news conference that she wouldchoose the leaders of the OAAU to succeed Malcolm X. Mrs. Collins operated the Sarah A. LittleSchool of Preparatory Arts where, she said, children were taught Arabic, Swahili, French, andSpanish. In 1959, she, too, had broken away from Elijah Muhammad's Black Muslims, to whichshe had originally been converted by Malcolm X. 
在波士顿，马尔科姆·X的同父异母的妹妹埃拉·梅·柯林斯夫人在一次新闻发布会上说，她将选择OAAU的领导人来接替马尔科姆·X。柯林斯夫人经营着萨拉·A·利特尔预备艺术学校，在那里，她说，孩子们被教授阿拉伯语、斯瓦希里语、法语和西班牙语。1959年，她也脱离了埃利亚·穆罕默德的黑人穆斯林，她最初是由马尔科姆·X皈依的。
Far from Harlem, in lands where Malcolm X had traveled, the press had giventhe murder acoverage that had highly irritated the Director of the United States Information Agency, Carl T.Rowan, himself a Negro. In Washington, addressing the American Foreign Service Association,Rowan said that when he first heard of the murder, he knew it would be grossly misconstrued insome countries where people were unaware what Malcolm X represented, and he said the USIAhad worked hard to inform the African press of the facts about Malcolm X and his preachments,but still there had been "a host of African reaction based on misinformation andmisrepresentation." 
远离哈林区，在马尔科姆·X曾经到过的地方，新闻界对这桩谋杀案的报道使美国新闻署署长安卡尔·特·罗文这位黑人极为恼火。在华盛顿，罗文在美国外交学会发表演说时说，当他第一次听说这桩谋杀案时，他就知道，在一些不了解马尔科姆·X所代表的国家里，人们会对此作出错误的解释。他说，美国新闻署已经努力向非洲新闻界介绍有关马尔科姆·X和他讲道的真实情况，但是，仍然出现了“大量的基于错误信息和曲解的非洲反应”。
Said USIA Director Rowan, "Mind you, here was a Negro who preached segregation and racehatred, killed by another Negro, presumably from another organization that preaches segregationand race hatred, and neither of them representative of more than a tiny minority of the Negropopulation of America-" Rowan held up some foreign newspapers. "All this about an ex-convict,ex-dope peddler who became a racial fanatic," continued Rowan. "I can only conclude that weAmericans know less about what goes on in the minds of other peoples than we thought, or theneed to inform is even greater than we in USIA thought it to be." 
美国新闻署署长罗文说:“请注意，这是一个鼓吹种族隔离和种族仇恨的黑人，被另一个黑人杀害，这个黑人可能是另一个鼓吹种族隔离和种族仇恨的组织的成员，他们两个人都不能代表美国黑人中的大多数。”罗文举起一些外国报纸。“这些都是关于一个前囚犯、前毒品贩子，他变成了一个种族狂热分子的报道，”罗文继续说。“我只能得出结论，我们美国人对其他民族的思想了解得比我们想象的要少，或者我们需要得到的信息比美国新闻署想象的要多。”
The _Daily Times_ of Lagos, in Nigeria, had said: "Like all mortals, Malcolm X was not without hisfaults . . . but that he was a dedicated and consistent disciple of the movement for theemancipation of his brethren, no one can doubt . . . Malcolm X has fought and died for what hebelieved to be right. He will have a place in the palace of martyrs." The _Ghanaian Times_, Accra,called Malcolm X "the militant and most popular of Afro-American anti-segregationist leaders" andit added his name to "a host of Africans and Americans" ranging from John Brown to PatriceLumumba "who were martyred in freedom's cause." Also in Accra, the _Daily Graphic_: "Theassassination of Malcolm X will go down in history as the greatest blow the Americanintegrationist movement has suffered since the shocking assassinations of Medgar Evers andJohn F. Kennedy."The Pakistan _Hurriyet of Karachi_ said: "A great Negro leader"; the _Pakistan Times_ said, "Hisdeath is a definite setback to the Negro movement for emancipation." The Peking, China_People's Daily_ said the killing happened "because Malcolm X . . . fought for the emancipationof the 23,000,000 American Negroes." According to correspondents' reports, the first Algerianheadline said "the Ku Klux Klan" assassinated Malcolm X; the pro-Communist _AlgerRepublican_'s editorial on the slaying accused "American Fascism," and the _Times'_ Algeriancorrespondent said Algerians showed "signs" of raising Malcolm X to martyrdom. The U.S.Consulate in Georgetown, British Guiana, was marched on by pickets accusing "Americanimperialists." Another Peking, China paper, _Jenmin Jihpao_, said that the death showed that "indealing with imperialist oppressors, violence must be met with violence." _Pravda_ in Moscowcarried only brief stories and no editorial comment, the _New York Times_ Moscowcorrespondent said, and another in Poland said there was no noticeable reaction of any kind, andthat "few Poles had heard of Malcolm or were interested in the racial issue." Reportedly, themurder was only routinely reported with little special interest by the press in Cairo, Beirut, NewDelhi, and Saigon. In Paris and Western Europe, the story was "essentially a one-day sensation,"with the West German press handling it "as if it were in the Chicago gangster tradition." The_New York Times_ said: ' The London newspapers have probably played the story harder andlonger than most, giving continuing emphasis to the police work on the murder. The _LondonTimes_ and the _London Daily Telegraph_ both carried editorial comments, but neither treatedMalcolm X as a major figure." Also reported by the _New York Times_ London correspondent wasthat "a London group calling itself the Council of African Organizations had violently attacked theUnited States over the murder. This group is made up of students and other unofficial Africanrepresentatives here. A press release described Malcolm as a 'leader in the struggle againstAmerican imperialism, oppression and racialism.'  It said, 'the butchers ofPatrice Lumumba are thevery same monsters who have murdered Malcolm X in cold blood.'" 
尼日利亚拉各斯的《每日时报》曾说：“像所有凡人一样，马尔科姆·X也有他的缺点……但他是一位坚定而一贯的运动信徒，为解放他的兄弟而战，没有人能否认这一点……马尔科姆·X为他所认为的正确事业而战而死。他在烈士的殿堂中有一席之地。” Accra的《加纳时报》称马尔科姆·X为“非洲裔美国人反种族隔离运动中最激进、最受欢迎的领导人”，并将其名字加入“从约翰·布朗到帕特里斯·卢蒙巴等人的名单中，他们在争取自由的斗争中成为烈士。”同样在Accra，《每日图形》说：“马尔科姆·X的暗杀将成为美国种族融合运动自令人震惊的埃弗斯和肯尼迪被暗杀以来遭受的最严重打击。” 巴基斯坦卡拉奇的《自由报》称马尔科姆·X为“伟大的黑人领袖”；《巴基斯坦时报》说，他的死“无疑对黑人解放运动造成了打击。” 北京的《人民日报》说，马尔科姆·X的暗杀“是因为他……为2300万美国黑人的解放而战。” 据记者报道，阿尔及利亚的第一条头版新闻说“三K党”暗杀了马尔科姆·X；亲共的《阿尔及利亚共和报》的社论指责“美国法西斯”，《时报》的阿尔及利亚记者说，阿尔及利亚人表现出“将马尔科姆·X提升为烈士的迹象。” 美国乔治敦的领事馆被抗议者包围，他们指责“美国帝国主义者。” 北京的另一家报纸《人民日报》说，马尔科姆·X的死表明“在处理帝国主义压迫者时，暴力必须以暴力回应。” 莫斯科的《真理报》只发表了简短的报道，没有社论评论，《纽约时报》的莫斯科记者说，另一家在波兰的记者说，没有任何明显的反应，而且“很少有波兰人听说过马尔科姆或对种族问题感兴趣。” 据报道，这起谋杀案在开罗、贝鲁特、新德里和西贡等地的新闻界中只是一般的报道，没有特别的兴趣。 在巴黎和西欧，这个故事“基本上只是一天的轰动”，《纽约时报》的巴黎记者说，《西德报》将此事处理为“芝加哥黑帮传统”，《伦敦时报》和《伦敦每日电讯报》都发表了社论评论，但都没有将马尔科姆·X视为重要人物。”《纽约时报》说：“伦敦报纸可能比大多数报纸更强烈、更长时间地报道了这个故事，持续强调警方对这起谋杀案的调查。《伦敦时报》和《伦敦每日电讯报》都发表了社论评论，但都没有将马尔科姆·X视为重要人物。”《纽约时报》伦敦记者还报道说，“一个自称非洲组织理事会的伦敦团体因马尔科姆·X的谋杀案而猛烈攻击美国。这个组织由在这里的学生和其他非官方的非洲代表组成。一份新闻稿将马尔科姆描述为“为反对美国帝国主义、压迫和种族主义而斗争的领导人”。 它说：“杀害帕特里斯·卢蒙巴的凶手就是杀害马尔科姆·X的冷血怪物。”
Friday morning New York City press headlines concerning Malcolm X's slaying were devoted tothe police department's apprehension of a second slaying suspect. He was a stocky, round-faced,twenty-six-year-old karate expert named Norman 3X Butler, allegedly a Black Muslim, and a weeklater, this was followed by the arrest of Thomas 15X Johnson, also allegedly a Black Muslim. Bothmen had been earlier indicted in the January, 1965, shooting of Benjamin Brown, a New York CityCorrection Officer and a Black Muslim defector. Both men were indicted, along with Haver, for themurder of Malcolm X on March 10. 
星期五上午，纽约市的新闻标题关注的是警方逮捕的第二个谋杀嫌疑人。他是一个矮壮、圆脸的26岁空手道专家，名叫诺曼·3X·巴特勒，据称是黑人穆斯林，一周后，警方又逮捕了托马斯·15X·约翰逊，他也据称是黑人穆斯林。这两人此前曾因1965年1月枪杀纽约市矫正官、黑人穆斯林叛逃者本杰明·布朗而被起诉。这两人和哈弗一起被起诉，涉嫌于3月10日谋杀了马尔科姆·X。
With the news announcement of Butler's arrest, and his at least tentative identification as amember of Elijah Muhammad's organization, tension reached a new high among all who had anyrole in the feud. The Black Muslim National Convention was scheduled to begin that Friday inChicago, to last for three days. Early Friday morning in New York at the Kennedy Airport dozensof policemen spent forty minutes searching a plane belonging to Capital Airlines, which back inDecember  1964 had accepted a Mosque Number 7 charter flight to Chicago and return, at a feeof $5,175.54 which the mosque had subsequently paid in increments. 
随着巴特勒被捕的消息发布，以及他至少被初步确认为埃利亚·穆罕默德组织的一员，这场争斗中所有角色之间的紧张局势达到了新的高潮。黑色穆斯林全国大会原定于那个星期五在芝加哥开始，持续三天。星期五清晨，在纽约肯尼迪机场，数十名警察花了四十分钟搜查了属于首都航空公司的飞机，这架飞机在1964年12月曾接受穆斯林第七清真寺的包机前往芝加哥并返回，费用为5175.54美元，清真寺随后分批支付了这笔费用。
Altogether, about three thousand Black Muslims from their mosques in most sizable cities were inChicago for their annual "Saviour's Day" convention, regarded by them as similar to the holiday ofChristmas. In the order of arrival, each group from the different mosques and cities assembledoutside the big sports coliseum south of Chicago's business district, the brothers of all agesdressed in neat, dark suits and white shirts and the sisters garbed in flowing silk gowns andheaddresses-and every individual was filtered through anintense security check that Chicagopolice sources said was unprecedented in Chicago except for a visiting President. 
总计约有三千名黑人穆斯林从他们所在城市的清真寺来到芝加哥参加一年一度的"救世主日"大会,他们认为这类似于圣诞节。按到达的顺序,不同清真寺和城市的每个团体都在芝加哥商业区南部的大体育竞技场外集合,所有年龄的兄弟都穿着整洁的深色西装和白色衬衫,姐妹们则穿着飘逸的丝绸长裙和头巾——每个人都必须经过严格的安检,芝加哥警方称这是芝加哥前所未有的,除了来访的总统。
Searched even more closely were the relatively few non-Muslim Negroes who came to bespectators, and the press representatives both white and black. "Take off your hat, show somerespect!" snapped a Black Muslim guard at a white reporter. As each person was "cleared" a Fruitof Islam man ushered him or her to a specific seat in the drafty interior of the 7500-seat coliseum.(Later, Muslim sources would blame the half-full house upon "the white man's dividing ofNegroes," but observers who recalled the packed coliseum in 1964 said that bombing fears keptaway many non-Muslim Negroes.) The audience sat lightly murmuring under the two hugehanging banners proclaiming "Welcome Elijah Muhammad-We Are Glad To Have You With Us"and "We Must Have Some Of This Land" (referring to Elijah Muhammad's demand that "one ormore states" be turned over to the "23 million so-called Negroes" in America as partial reparationfor "over a century of our free blood and sweat as slaves which helped to develop this wealthynation where still today you show us you do not wish or intend to accept us as equals"). In front ofthe wide, raised speaker's platform were two nearly life-sized photographic blowups of ElijahMuhammad. Standing between the stage and the audience were Fruit of Islam guards. Otherswere prowling the aisles, scanning rows of faces, with intermittent peremptory demands foridentification, "What mosque, brother?" Still more Fruit of Islam men were inspecting thecoliseum's vacant balcony, backstage, downstairs, and rafters and roof. 
更仔细地搜索了那些相对较少的非穆斯林黑人，他们成为了旁观者，以及白人和黑人的新闻代表。“摘下你的帽子，表现出一些尊重！”一位黑人穆斯林警卫对一位白人记者厉声说道。当每个人被“清理”后，一个水果伊斯兰教的人会把他或她带到体育馆7500个座位的寒冷内部的一个特定座位上。（后来，穆斯林的来源会指责半满的观众是“白人的分裂黑人”，但回忆起1964年满座的体育馆的观察者说，对爆炸的恐惧使许多非穆斯林黑人远离了这里。）观众们轻轻地低声说着话，下面挂着两面巨大的横幅，上面写着“欢迎伊利亚·穆罕默德——我们很高兴你和我们在一起”和“我们必须拥有这片土地”（指的是伊利亚·穆罕默德要求“一个或更多的州”交给美国的“2300万所谓的黑人”作为对“我们作为奴隶无偿流血流汗超过一个世纪，帮助发展这个富饶国家，而今天你仍然告诉我们你不希望或打算接受我们作为平等的人”的部分赔偿）。在宽大的讲台前面有两个几乎等身大小的埃利亚·穆罕默德的放大照片。站在舞台和观众之间的是一些水果伊斯兰教的警卫。其他人则在过道里游荡，扫描一排排的脸，不时地发出命令，“兄弟，你们是哪个清真寺的？”更多的水果伊斯兰教的人正在检查体育馆的空置的阳台，后台，楼下，阁楼和屋顶。
The ghost of Malcolm X was in the coliseum. First, in a high drama for the Muslims, ElijahMuhammad's son, Wallace Delaney Muhammad, who once had sided with Malcolm X, faced theaudience and begged forgiveness for his defection. Next, two brothers of Malcolm X, Wilfred andPhilbert, both of them Black Muslim ministers, urged unity with Elijah Muhammad. Said MinisterWilfred X of the Detroit mosque, "We would be ignorant to get confusedand go to arguing andfighting among ourselves and forget who the real enemy is." Said Minister Philbert X, of theLansing mosque, "Malcolm was my own blood brother, next to me. . . . I was shocked. No manwants to see his own brother destroyed. But I knew that he was traveling on a very reckless anddangerous road. I made attempts to change his course. When he was living, I tried to keep himliving; now that he is dead, there is nothing I can do." Indicating the seated Elijah Muhammad,Minister Philbert X declared, "Where he leads me, I will follow"-and then he introduced the BlackMuslim leader to make his address. 
马尔科姆·X的鬼魂在竞技场里。首先，在一场为穆斯林举行的戏剧中，埃利亚·穆罕默德的儿子，华莱士·德莱尼·穆罕默德，曾经站在马尔科姆·X一边，面对观众，请求原谅他的背叛。接下来，马尔科姆·X的两个兄弟，威尔弗雷德和菲尔伯特，他们都是黑人穆斯林牧师，敦促与埃利亚·穆罕默德团结。底特律清真寺的牧师威尔弗雷德·X说：“我们无知地混淆，互相争论和打架，忘记谁是真正的敌人。”兰辛清真寺的牧师菲尔伯特·X说：“马尔科姆是我自己的亲兄弟，仅次于我……我感到震惊。没有人愿意看到自己的兄弟被摧毁。但我知道他走的是一条非常鲁莽和危险的道路。我试图改变他的方向。在他活着的时候，我试图让他活着；现在他死了，我无能为力。”菲尔伯特·X牧师指着坐着的埃利亚·穆罕默德说：“他引导我去哪里，我就跟随他——然后他把黑人穆斯林领袖介绍给大家，让他发表演讲。”
Only the head of Elijah Muhammad was visible above the grim-faced Fruit of Islam men in a livingwall, Cassius Clay among them. Crescents, stars, moons and suns were in goldthreadembroidery on the small fez that Elijah Muhammad wore. He said in his speech: "For a long time,Malcolm stood here where I stand. In those days, Malcolm was safe, Malcolm was loved. God,Himself, protected Malcolm. . . . For more than a year, Malcolm was given his freedom. He wenteverywhere-Asia, Europe, Africa, even to Mecca, trying to make enemies for me. He came backpreaching that we should not hate the enemy. . . . He came here a few weeks ago to blast awayhis hate and mud-slinging; everything he could think of to disgrace me. . . . We didn't want to killMalcolm and didn't try to kill him. They know I didn't harm Malcolm. They know I loved him. Hisfoolish teaching brought him to his own end. . . ." 
只有以利亚穆罕默德的头颅在面无表情的水果伊斯兰教徒的活墙之上，其中就有卡修斯克莱。以利亚穆罕默德头戴的小费兹帽上，用金线绣着新月、星星、月亮和太阳。他在演讲中说：“很久以前，马尔科姆就站在我现在站的地方。那时候，马尔科姆是安全的，马尔科姆是被爱的。上帝，他自己，保护着马尔科姆……。一年多的时间里，马尔科姆被给予了自由。他去了亚洲、欧洲、非洲，甚至麦加，试图为我制造敌人。他回来后，宣讲说我们不应该恨敌人……。他几周前回到这里，来消除他对我的恨意和恶语中伤；他能想到的所有让我蒙羞的事情……。我们不想杀死马尔科姆，也没有试图杀死他。他们知道我没有伤害马尔科姆。他们知道我爱他。他的愚蠢教诲使他自取灭亡……。”
Both physically and emotionally worked up, often Elijah Muhammad would begin coughing. "Takeit easy! Take your time!" his audience pleaded with him. "He had no right to reject me!" ElijahMuhammad declared. "He was a star, who went astray! . . . They knew I didn't harm Malcolm, buthe tried to make war against me." He said that Malcolm X would have been given "the mostglorious of burials" if he had stayed with the Black Muslims and had died a natural death;"instead, we stand beside the grave of a hypocrite! . . . _Malcolm_! Who was he leading? Whowas he teaching? He has no truth! We didn't wantto kill Malcolm! His foolish teaching would bringhim to his own end! I am not going to let the crackpots destroy the good things Allah sent to youand me!" 
身体和情绪都紧张起来, 通常以利亚穆罕默德会开始咳嗽。"放松点! 不要着急!"他的听众恳求他。"他没有权利拒绝我!"以利亚穆罕默德宣称。"他是一个明星, 走错了路! . . .他们知道我没有伤害马尔科姆, 但他试图与我作战。"他说如果马尔科姆X留在黑人穆斯林并自然死亡, 他将被给予"最光荣的葬礼";"相反, 我们站在一个伪君子的坟墓旁! . . . 马尔科姆! 他在引导谁? 他在教谁? 他没有真理! 我们不想杀死马尔科姆! 他的愚蠢教导会让他自取灭亡! 我不会让那些疯子破坏上帝赐予你和我的好东西!"
Elijah Muhammad drove his frail energy to speak for about an hour and a half. He challenged anywould-be assassins: "If you seek to snuff out the life of Elijah Muhammad, you are inviting yourown doom! The Holy Quran tells us not to pick a fight but to defend ourselves. We will fight!" Itwas mid-afternoon when Elijah Muhammad turned back to his seat with some three thousandBlack Muslim men, women, and children shouting "Yes, _sir_! . . . So sweet! . . . All praise toMuhammad!" 
以利亚·穆罕默德鼓足他那虚弱的精力讲了大约一个半小时。他向任何潜在的刺客挑战说：“你们如果企图杀害以利亚·穆罕默德，那就是自寻死路！《古兰经》告诉我们不要主动挑起争斗，而是要自卫。我们会战斗的！”当时是午后，以利亚·穆罕默德转过身来，身后是大约三千名黑人穆斯林男人、女人和孩子，他们齐声高喊：“是的，先生！……太好了！……赞美穆罕默德！”
In the Unity Funeral Home in the Harlem community of New York City in the mid-afternoon, thepublic's viewing of the body of Malcolm X was interrupted by the arrival of a party of about adozen people whose central figure was a white-turbaned, dark-robed elderly man whose whitebeard fell to his chest and who carried a forked stick. When reporters rushed to attemptinterviews, another man in the party waved them away, saying, "A silent tongue does not betrayits owner." The man was Sheik 
在纽约市哈莱姆区的统一殡仪馆的午后，公众瞻仰马尔科姆·X的遗体时，被一个约有十二人的队伍打断，队伍的中心人物是一位戴着白色头巾、身穿黑色长袍、白胡子垂到胸前并手持分叉手杖的老人。当记者冲过去试图采访时，队伍中的另一个人挥手让他们走开，说：“沉默的舌头不会背叛它的主人。” 这个人就是谢赫·阿布杜勒·阿齐兹·本·巴扎兹。
Ahmed Hassoun, a Sudanese, a member of the Sunni Moslems, who had taught in Mecca for 35years when he had met Malcolm X there, and then had soon come to the United States to serveas Malcolm X's spiritual advisor and to teach at the Muslim Mosque, Inc. 
艾哈迈德·哈桑,苏丹人,逊尼派穆斯林教徒,在麦加教书35年,在那里遇见了马尔科姆·X,不久后来到美国,担任马尔科姆·X的精神导师,并在穆斯林清真寺公司教书。
Sheik Hassoun prepared the body for burial in accordance with Moslem ritual. Removing theWestern clothing in which the body had been on display, Sheik Hassoun washed the body withspecial holy oil. Then he draped the body in the traditional seven white linen shrouds, called the_kafan_. Only the face with its reddish moustache and goatee was left exposed. The mournerswho had come with Sheik Hassoun filed to the bier and he read passages from theKoran. Thenhe turned to a funeral home representative: "Now the body is ready for burial." Soon, the sheikand his retinue left, and the viewing by the public resumed. When the word spread, numbers ofpersons who had come before returned for another wait in the long, slowly moving line, wantingto see the Moslem burial dress. 
夏克·哈苏依穆斯林仪式准备尸体入葬。他除去尸体上展示过的西方服装，用一种特殊的圣油洗净尸体。然后，他用传统的七层白色亚麻裹尸布，即《卡凡》裹尸。只有红胡子和小胡子的脸露在外面。夏克·哈苏依带来的哀悼者排着队走向灵柩，他朗读《古兰经》中的篇章。然后，他转向殡仪馆的代表说：“现在尸体准备入葬了。”很快，夏克·哈苏依和他的随从离开了，公众的瞻仰活动又开始了。当消息传开时，许多人又返回来，排在长长的、缓慢移动的队伍中，想看看穆斯林的入葬服装。
It was late during this Friday afternoon that I got into the quietly moving line, thinking about theMalcolm X with whom I had worked closely for about two years. Blue-uniformed policemen stoodat intervals watching us shuffle along within the wooden gray-painted police barricades. Justacross the street several men were looking at the line from behind a large side window of the"Lone Star Barber Shop, Eddie Johns, Prop., William Ashe, Mgr." Among the policemen were afew press representatives talking to each other to pass the time. Then we were inside the softlylit, hushed, cool, large chapel. Standing at either end of the long, handsome bronze coffin weretwo big, dark policemen, mostly looking straight ahead, but moving their lips when some viewertarried. Within minutes I had reached the coffin. Under the glass lid, I glimpsed the delicate whiteshrouding over the chest and up like a hood about the face on which I tried to concentrate for aslong as I could. All that I could think was that it was he, all right-Malcolm X. "Move on"-thepoliceman's voice was soft. Malcolm looked to me-just waxy and _dead_. The policeman's handwas gesturing at his waist level. I thought, "_Well-good-bye_." I moved on. 
周五下午晚些时候，我走进了静静移动的队伍，想起了我和他一起工作了大约两年的马尔科姆·X。穿着蓝色制服的警察站在我们队伍的间隔处，看着我们在木制的灰色警戒线内慢慢移动。街对面，几个男人站在“孤独之星理发店，埃迪·约翰斯，业主，威廉·阿什，经理”的大侧窗后面看着队伍。警察中有几个是新闻代表，他们正在互相交谈以打发时间。然后我们走进了光线柔和、安静、凉爽、宽敞的大教堂。站在长而漂亮的青铜棺材两端的是两个高大的黑人警察，他们大部分时间都直视前方，但当有观众停留时，他们会动动嘴唇。几分钟后，我来到了棺材前。在玻璃盖下，我瞥见了覆盖在胸部和脸部的精致白布，我试图尽可能长时间地集中精力。我能想到的只是，没错，这就是他——马尔科姆·X。“继续前进”——警察的声音很轻。马尔科姆看起来——只是蜡制的，死了。警察的手在腰部水平挥动。我想，“好吧，再见。”我继续前进。
Twenty-two thousand people had viewed the body when the line was stopped that night for good,at eleven P.M. Quietly, between midnight and dawn, a dozen police cars flanked a hearse thatwent the twenty-odd blocks farther uptown to the Faith Temple. The bronze coffin was wheeledinside and placed upon a platform draped in thick dark red velvet, in front of the altar, and thecoffin's lid was reopened. As the hearse pulled away, policemen stood at posts of vigil both insideand outside Faith Temple. It was crispy cold outside.About six A.M., people began forming a line on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue. By nine A.M., an estimated six thousand persons thronged the nearby blocks, behind police barriers, andfaces were in every window of the apartment buildings across the street; some stood shivering onfire escapes. From 145th Street to  149th Street, policemen had blocked off all automobile trafficexcept for their own cars, the newspapers' cars, and the equipment trucks for radio and televisionon-the-spot coverage. There were hundreds of policemen, some on the rooftops in the immediatearea. Combing the crowd's edges were reporters with microphones and notebooks. "He wasfascinating, a remarkably fascinating man, that's why I'm here," a white girl in her mid-twentiestold a _New York Times_ man; and a Negro woman, "I'm paying my respects to the greatest blackman in this century. He's a black man. Don't say colored." Another woman, noticing steel helmetsinside a television network car, laughed to the driver, "You getting ready for next summer?" 
当那天晚上十一点钟的时候，人们停止了排队，从此以后就再也没有人排队了。午夜到黎明之间，十几辆警车簇拥着一辆灵车，沿着那条通往二十多街区的向上大道，来到了信仰堂。那口青铜棺材被推了进去，放在一个用厚厚的深红色天鹅绒布料覆盖的平台上，放在祭坛前面，棺材的盖子被重新打开。当灵车开走的时候，警察在信仰堂内外的警戒岗位上站岗。外面的天气冷得刺骨。早上六点左右，人们开始在阿姆斯特丹大道的东侧排队。到上午九点的时候，据估计有六千人拥在附近的街区，站在警察设置的屏障后面，对面街上的公寓楼的每一扇窗户里都挤满了脸庞，有些人站在冷得发抖的消防梯上。从145街到149街，警察封锁了所有的汽车交通，除了他们自己的车、报纸的车和电视台和电台的现场报道设备车。有几百名警察，有些在附近区域的屋顶上。记者们拿着麦克风和笔记本，梳理着人群的边缘。一个二十多岁的白人女孩对《纽约时报》的记者说：“他是个迷人的家伙，非常迷人，这就是我来这里的原因。”一个黑人妇女说：“我来向本世纪最伟大的黑人致敬。他是个黑人，不要说有色人种。”另一个妇女注意到一辆电视网络车里的钢盔，笑着对司机说：“你是不是准备迎接明年夏天？”
When the Faith Temple doors were opened at 9:20, a corps of OAAU members entered. Withinthe next quarter-hour, twenty of the men had ushered in six hundred seat-holders. Fifty pressreporters, photographers and television cameramen clustered beneath religious murals to therear of the altar, and some stood on chairs to see better. A Negro engineer monitored recordingequipment between the altar and the coffin which was guarded by eight uniformed Negropolicemen and two uniformed Negro policewomen. One Negro plain-clothes policeman sat oneither side of heavily veiled Sister Betty in the second row. The raised lid of the coffin hid the FaithTemple's brass tithe box and candelabra; the head of the Islamic Mission of America, in Brooklyn,Sheik Al-Haj Daoud Ahmed Faisal, had counseled that any hint of Christianity in the serviceswould make the deceased a _kafir_, an unbeliever. (The sheik had also dissented with the daysof public exhibition of the body: "Death is a private matter between Allah and the deceased.") 
当9时20分佛堂的大门打开时,一群OAAU成员走了进去。在接下来的15分钟内,20名男子把600名座位持有者引进了佛堂。50名新闻记者、摄影师和电视摄像师聚集在佛堂的宗教壁画下,在祭坛的后面,有些人站在椅子上以便看得更清楚。一名黑人工程师在祭坛和棺材之间监视录音设备,棺材由8名穿着制服的黑人警察和2名穿着制服的黑人女警察看守。一名穿便衣的黑人警察坐在第二排的重帘后面,贝蒂修女的两侧。棺材盖上的金箔捐款箱和烛台隐藏在祭堂内;美国伊斯兰教会在布鲁克林的代表,谢赫·阿赫贾·达乌德·艾哈迈德·法萨尔曾建议,在服务中任何暗示基督教的东西都会使死者成为一个“卡非尔”,即不信教者。 (谢赫还反对尸体公开陈列的几天:“死亡是真主和死者之间的私事。”)
 Before the services began, OAAU ushers brought in one floral wreath-a two-by-five arrangementof the Islamic Star and Crescent in white carnations against a background of red carnations. 
礼拜开始前, OAAU的门房带进来一个花圈——一个二乘五的花圈, 里面是白色的康乃馨组成的伊斯兰教的星月标志, 背景是红色的康乃馨。
First, the actor Ossie Davis and his wife, actress Ruby Dee, read the notes, telegrams and cablesof condolence. They came from every major civil-rights organization; from individual figures suchas Dr. Martin Luther King; from organizations and governments abroad, such as The Africa- Pakistan-West-Indian Society of the London School of Economics, the Pan-African Congress ofSouthern Africa, the Nigerian Ambassador from Lagos, the President of the Republic of Ghana,Dr. Kwame Nkrumah: "The death of Malcolm X shall not have been in vain." 
首先，演员奥西·戴维斯和他的妻子，女演员鲁比·迪，读了笔记、电报和唁电。它们来自每一个主要的民权组织；来自像马丁·路德·金博士这样的个人；来自海外的组织和政府，如伦敦经济学院的非洲-巴基斯坦-西印度社会、南部非洲泛非大会、拉各斯的尼日利亚大使、加纳共和国总统夸梅·恩克鲁玛博士：“马尔科姆·X的死不会白费。”
Next, Omar Osman stood, a representative of the Islam Center of Switzerland and the UnitedStates: "We knew Brother Malcolm as a blood brother, particularly after his pilgrimage to Meccalast year. The highest thing that a Moslem can aspire to is to die on the battlefield and not die athis bedside-" He paused briefly to wait out the applause from among the mourners. "Those whodie on the battlefield are not dead, but are alive!" The applause was louder, and cries rose, "Right!Right!" Omar Osman then critically commented upon the remarks which USIA Director CarlRowan had made in Washington, D.C., about the foreign press reaction to the death of thedeceased. From the audience then hisses rose. 
然后，奥马尔·奥斯曼站起来，他是瑞士伊斯兰中心和美国伊斯兰中心的代表：“我们把马尔科姆当作亲兄弟，特别是在他去年麦加朝圣之后。穆斯林能渴望的最高事情就是死在战场上，而不是死在他的床边。”他短暂地停顿了一下，等待哀悼者们的掌声。 “在战场上死去的人并没有死，而是活着！”掌声更大了，有人喊道：“对！对！” 奥马尔·奥斯曼接着对美国国际新闻署主任卡尔·罗文在华盛顿特区就外国媒体对死者死亡的反应发表的言论进行了批评。这时，观众中传来嘘声。
Again, the actor Ossie Davis stood. His deep voice delivered the eulogy to Malcolm X which wasgoing to cause Davis subsequently to be hailed more than ever among Negroes in Harlem: 
演员奥西·戴维斯再次站了起来。他那深沉的声音发表了向马尔科姆·X的悼词，这将使戴维斯在哈莱姆的黑人中受到比以往任何时候都更多的赞扬：
"Here-at this final hour, in this quiet place, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightesthopes-extinguished now, and gone from us forever. . . . 
在这个最后的时刻，在这个宁静的地方，哈莱姆聚集来向它最灿烂的希望之一——现在已经熄灭，永远地离开了我们——告别。
 "Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain- and we will smile. . . . They will say that he is of hate-a fanatic, a racist-who can only bring evil tothe cause for which you struggle! 
许多人会问哈莱姆人从这位狂风骤雨般、有争议而又大胆的年轻船长身上发现了什么值得尊敬的东西——我们会微笑……他们会说他是仇恨的化身——一个狂热分子、一个种族主义者——他只会给你们为之奋斗的事业带来邪恶！
"And we will answer and say unto them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touchhim, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing?Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you wouldknow him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him: Malcolm was ourmanhood, our living, black manhood! This was his meaning to his people. And, in honoring him,we honor the best in ourselves. . . . And we will know him then for what he was and is-a Prince- our own black shining Prince!-who didn't hesitate to die, because he loved us so." 
我们将回答他们说："你们曾经和马尔科姆谈过话吗?你们曾经接触过他,或者让他对你们微笑过吗?你们曾经真正听他说话吗?他曾经做过什么不好的事吗?他曾经与暴力或任何公共骚乱有关联吗?因为如果你们这样做过,你们就会了解他。如果你们了解他,你们就会知道我们为什么必须尊敬他:马尔科姆是我们男子气概的象征,是我们活着的黑人男子气概的象征!这就是他对他的人民的意义。在尊敬他的同时,我们也尊敬我们自己最好的一面。……然后我们就会知道他是什么样的人——一个王子——我们自己的黑发闪亮的王子——他毫不犹豫地去死,因为他如此地爱我们。"
Brief speeches were made by others. Then, the family, the OAAU members and other Muslimspresent stood and filed by the coffin to view the body for the last time. Finally, the two plain- clothes policemen ushered Sister Betty to have her last sight of her husband. She leaned over,kissing the glass over him; she broke into tears. Until then almost no crying had been heard in theservices, but now Sister Betty's sobs were taken up by other women. 
有简短的致词。然后，家属、OAAU会员和其他穆斯林站立起来，依次绕过棺材瞻仰遗体。最后，两名便衣警察引领贝蒂修女去见她丈夫最后一面。她俯身过去，吻了吻盖在他身上的玻璃；她痛哭起来。此前在葬礼上几乎听不到哭泣声，但这时贝蒂修女的抽泣声被其他妇女接了过去。
The services had lasted a little over an hour when the three minutes of prayers said for everyMuslim who is dead were recited by Alhajj Heshaam Jaaber, of Elizabeth, New Jersey. At thephrase "Allahu Akbar"-"God is most great"-all Muslims in the audience placed their opened handsat the sides of their faces. 
这项服务持续了一个多小时, 当时新泽西州伊丽莎白的艾哈贾·哈沙姆·贾贝尔为每一位穆斯林诵读了每死必诵的三分钟祈祷词。在“真主伟大”这一句时, 观众中的所有穆斯林都把他们张开的手放在了他们的脸旁。
An official cortege, with the hearse, of three family cars, eighteen mourners' cars, twelve policecars and six press cars-followed by about fifty other cars-briskly drove the eighteen miles out ofManhattan and along the New York Thruway, then off its Exit 7 to reach the Ferncliff Cemetery inArdsley, N.Y. All along the route, Negroes placed their hats or hands over their hearts,paying theirfinal respects. At each bridge crossing in Manhattan County, police cars stood watch; theWestchester County police had stationed individual patrolmen at intervals en route to thecemetery. 
一辆由灵车、三辆家庭轿车、十八辆送葬车、十二辆警车和六辆新闻车组成的官方行列，后面跟着大约五十辆其他的车，飞快地驶出曼哈顿，沿着纽约高速公路，然后离开它的7号出口，到达纽约州阿德莱的 Ferncliff 墓地。沿途，黑人把他们的帽子或手放在他们的心上，表示最后的敬意。在曼哈顿县的每座桥上，都有警车守卫；韦斯特切斯特县警方在通往墓地的路上每隔一段距离就布置了一名巡逻员。
Over the coffin, final Moslem prayers were said by Sheik Alhajj Heshaam Jaaber. The coffin waslowered into the grave, the head facing the east, in keeping with Islamic tradition. Among themourners, the Moslems knelt beside the grave to pray with their foreheads pressed to the earth,in the Eastern manner. When the family left the gravesite, followers of Malcolm X would not letthe coffin be covered by the white grave-diggers who had stood a little distance away, waiting.Instead, seven OAAU men began dropping bare handfuls of earth down on the coffin; then theywere given shovels and they carried dirt to fill the grave, and then mound it. 
棺材上，谢赫·阿赫贾·哈希姆·贾巴尔为他做了最后的穆斯林祈祷。棺材被放入墓穴，头朝东，遵循伊斯兰传统。在哀悼者中，穆斯林跪在墓旁，额头贴着地面，以东方的方式祈祷。当家人离开墓地时，马尔科姆·X的追随者不让站在稍远处等待的白人掘墓人盖上棺材。相反，七个OAAU的人开始把一把把的泥土撒在棺材上；然后他们被给了铲子，他们把泥土运到墓穴里，然后堆起来。
The night fell over the earthly remains of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, who had been called MalcolmX; who had been called Malcolm Little; who had been called "Big Red" and "Satan" and"Homeboy" and other names-who had been buried as a Moslem. "According to the Koran," the_New York Times_ reported, "the bodies of the dead remain in their graves until the Last Day, theDay of Judgment. On this day of cataclysm the heavens are rent and the mountains ground todust, the graves open and men are called to account by Allah. 
夜幕降临在被埋葬为穆斯林的埃尔-哈吉·马利克·埃尔-沙巴兹的遗体上。《纽约时报》报道说：“根据《古兰经》，死者的尸体要到末日、审判日那天才从坟墓中出来。到那一天，天空崩裂，山岳化为尘土，坟墓打开，人们要向真主交账。”
"The blessed-the godfearing, the humble, the charitable, those who have suffered and beenpersecuted for Allah's sake or fought in religious wars for Islam-are summoned to the Garden ofParadise. 
幸福的人-敬畏上帝的人,谦逊的人,慈善的人,为真主的缘故而受苦和被迫害的人,或者为了伊斯兰教而参加宗教战争的人-被召唤到天堂的乐园。
"There, according to the teaching of Mohammed, the Prophet, they live forever by flowingstreams, reclining on silken cushions, and enjoying the company of dark-eyed maidens and wivesof perfect purity. 
根据穆罕默德先知的教导，在那里，他们将永远生活在潺潺流水旁，躺在丝质软垫上，享受着黑眼睛少女和完美纯洁的妻子的陪伴。
 "The damned-the covetous, the evildoer, the follower of gods other than Allah-are sent to EternalFire, where they are fed boiling water and molten brass. 'The death from which ye flee will trulyovertake you,' the Koran says. 'Then will ye be sent back to the Knower of things secret andopen, and He will tell you the truth of the things that ye did.'" 
"被诅咒的——贪婪的、作恶的、崇拜神灵除了真主的人——被送到永恒的火中，在那里他们被喂以沸腾的水和熔化的铜。《古兰经》说：‘你们所逃避的死亡确实会找到你们。’然后你们将被送回知道隐秘和公开事物的主那里，他将告诉你们你们所做事情的真相。"
After signing the contract for this book, Malcolm X looked at me hard. "A writer is what I want, notan interpreter." I tried to be a dispassionate chronicler. But he was the most electric personality Ihave ever met, and I still can't quite conceive him dead. It still feels to me as if he has just goneinto some next chapter, to be written by historians. 
签署这本书的合同后，马尔科姆·X严肃地看着我。“我想要的是作家，而不是口译员。”我试图做一个冷静的记录者。但他是我见过的最有魅力的个性，我仍然无法完全接受他已经去世的事实。对我来说，他似乎只是进入了历史学家将要写的下一章。

OSSIE DAVIS 
奥斯瓦尔德·戴维斯
ON MALCOLM X 
关于马尔科姆·X
[Mr. Davis wrote the following in response to a magazine editor's question: Why did you eulogizeMalcolm X?] You are not the only person curious to know why I would eulogize a man likeMalcolm X. Many who know and respect me have written letters. Of these letters I am proudest ofthose from a sixth-grade class of young white boys and girls who asked me to explain. Iappreciate your giving me this chance to do so. 
戴维斯先生在回答一位杂志编辑的问题时写道：“你不是唯一一个想知道我为何赞扬马尔科姆X的人。许多了解我并尊重我的人都写信给我。在这些信中，我最引以为豪的是来自一群六年级的年轻白人男孩和女孩的信，他们要求我解释。我感谢你给我这个机会。”
You may anticipate my defense somewhat by considering the following fact: no Negro has yetasked me that question. (My pastor in Grace Baptist Church where I teach Sunday Schoolpreached a sermon about Malcolm in which he called him a "giant in a sick world.") Every one ofthe many letters I got frommy own people lauded Malcolm as a man, and commended me forhaving spoken at his funeral. 
你可以通过考虑以下事实来预见到我的辩护：还没有一个黑人问我那个问题（我在格雷斯浸信会教堂教周日学校，那里的牧师布道时称马尔科姆为“病态世界中的巨人”）。我收到的许多信件都赞扬马尔科姆是一个人，并赞扬我在他的葬礼上发言。
At the same time-and this is important-most of them took special pains to disagree with much orall of what Malcolm said and what he stood for. That is, with one singing exception, they all, everylast, black, glory-hugging one of them, knew that Malcolm-whatever else he was or was not- _Malcolm was a man_! 
同时，这一点很重要，他们中的大多数人特别费劲地不同意马尔科姆说的和他所代表的一切，也就是说，只有一个例外，他们每一个，每一个黑人，每一个拥抱荣耀的人，都知道马尔科姆，不管他是什么或不是什么，马尔科姆是个男人！
White folks do not need anybody to remind them that they are men. We do! This was his oneincontrovertible benefit to his people. 
白人不需要任何人提醒他们是男人。我们才需要！这是他给他的人民带来的唯一不容置疑的好处。
Protocol and common sense require that Negroes stand back and let the white man speak up forus, defend us, and lead us from behind the scene in our fight. This is the essence of Negropolitics. But Malcolm said to hell with that! Get up off your knees and fight your own battles. That'sthe way to win back your self-respect. That's the way to make the white man respect you. And ifhe won't let you live like a man, he certainly can't keep you from dying like one! 
协议和常识要求黑人退后，让白人代表我们发言，保护我们，带领我们在幕后进行斗争。这就是Negropolitics的本质。但是Malcolm说去他的！站起来，自己战斗。这是赢回自尊的方式。这是让白人尊重你的方式。如果他不让你像人一样生活，他肯定不能阻止你像人一样死去！
Malcolm, as you can see, was refreshing excitement; he scared hell out of the rest of us, bred aswe are to caution, to hypocrisy in the presence of white folks, to the smile that never fades.Malcolm knew that every white man in America profits directly or indirectly from his position vis-a- vis Negroes, profits from racism even though he does not practice it or believe in it. 
马尔科姆能使人振奋；他吓得我们其余的人胆战心惊，因为我们是被培养成谨慎的、在白人面前装模作样的、脸上总挂着微笑的。马尔科姆知道美国每一个白人，不管直接还是间接，都从他与黑人的关系中得益，从种族主义中得益，尽管他并不实行种族主义，也不相信种族主义。
He also knew that every Negro who did not challenge on the spot every instance of racism, overtor covert, committed against him and his people, who chose instead to swallow his spit and go onsmiling, was an Uncle Tom and a traitor, without balls or guts, or any other commonly acceptedaspects of manhood! 
他也知道，每一个不立刻挑战针对他和他的人民的任何种族歧视，不管是公开的还是隐蔽的，而是选择咽下这口唾沫，继续微笑的黑人，都是一个汤姆叔叔式的人物，一个背叛者，一个没有男子气概的人，一个没有男子气概的任何其他通常被接受的方面的人！
 Now, we knew all these things as well as Malcolm did, but we also knew what happened topeople who stick their necks out and say them. And if all the lies we tell ourselves by way ofextenuation were put into print, it would constitute one of the great chapters in the history ofman's justifiable cowardice in the face of other men. 
现在,我们像马尔科姆一样知道所有这些事情,但是我们也知道那些把脖子伸出去说出真相的人会有什么下场。如果我们把自我开脱时说的所有谎言都写下来,那将构成人类历史上关于面对他人时正当的懦弱的最伟大的章节之一。
But Malcolm kept snatching our lies away. He kept shouting the painful truth we whites andblacks did not want to hear from all the housetops. And he wouldn't stop for love nor money. 
但是马尔科姆不断地把我们的谎言夺走。他不断地在房顶上喊出我们白人和黑人都不想听到的痛苦的真相。而且他不会因为爱或者钱而停止。
You can imagine what a howling, shocking nuisance this man was to both Negroes and whites.Once Malcolm fastened on you, you could not escape. He was one of the most fascinating andcharming men I have ever met, and never hesitated to take his attractiveness and beat you todeath with it. Yet his irritation, though painful to us, was most salutary. He would make you angryas hell, but he would also make you proud. It was impossible to remain defensive and apologeticabout being a Negro in his presence. He wouldn't let you. And you always left his presence with the sneaky suspicion that maybe, after all, you _were_ a man! 
你可以想象，这个人对黑人和白人来说都是多么令人厌恶和震惊的讨厌鬼。一旦马尔科姆盯上你，你就无法逃脱。他是我见过的最迷人、最迷人的男人之一，他毫不犹豫地利用自己的吸引力，把你打到死。然而，他的恼怒，尽管对我们来说是痛苦的，却是最有益的。他会让你火冒三丈，但也会让你感到骄傲。在他的面前，你不可能保持防御和道歉的态度。他不会让你这样做的。你总是带着偷偷的怀疑离开他的存在，也许，毕竟，你真的是一个男人！
But in explaining Malcolm, let me take care not to explain him away. He had been a criminal, anaddict, a pimp, and a prisoner; a racist, and a hater, he had really believed the white man was adevil. But all this had changed. Two days before his death, in commenting to Gordon Parks abouthis past life he said: "That was a mad scene. The sickness and madness of those days! I'm gladto be free of them." 
但是，在解释马尔科姆时，我要小心，不要把他解释掉。他曾经是个罪犯、瘾君子、皮条客和囚犯；他是个种族主义者，是个仇恨者，他真的相信白人是魔鬼。但是这一切都改变了。在他死前两天，他对戈登·帕克斯谈到他的过去时说：“那是疯狂的场景。那些日子的疯狂和病态！我很高兴摆脱了它们。”
And Malcolm was free. No one who knew him before and after his trip to Mecca could doubt thathe had completely abandoned racism, separatism, and hatred. But he had not abandoned hisshock-effect statements, his bristling agitation for immediate freedom in this country not only forblacks, but for everybody. And most of all, in the area of race relations, he still delighted intwisting the white man's tail, and in making Uncle Toms, compromisers and accommodationists-Ideliberately include myself-thoroughly ashamed of the urbane and smiling hypocrisy we practicemerely to exist in a world whose values we both envy and despise. 
马尔科姆自由了。了解他前后变化的人，没有一个会怀疑他已经完全放弃了种族主义、分离主义和仇恨。但他没有放弃那些制造轰动效应的声明，没有放弃他那种为了在这个国家获得立即自由而激动不已的态度，不仅为了黑人，而且为了所有人。最重要的是，在种族关系方面，他仍然喜欢戏弄白人，让汤姆叔叔、妥协者和调停者——我故意把自己包括在内——为我们在仅仅为了在一个我们既羡慕又鄙视其价值观的世界中生存而实行的文雅而微笑的伪善感到羞愧。
But even had Malcolm not changed, he would still have been a relevant figure on the Americanscene, standing in relation as he does, to the "responsible" civil rights leaders, just about whereJohn Brown stood in relation to the "responsible abolitionists in the fight against slavery. Almostall disagreed with Brown's mad and fanatical tactics which led him foolishly to attack a Federalarsenal at Harpers Ferry, to lose two sons there, and later to be hanged for treason. 
但是，即使马尔科姆没有改变，他仍然会是美国场景中一个相关的人物，他与那些"负责任"的民权领袖的关系，就如同约翰·布朗与那些"负责任的废奴主义者"在反对奴隶制斗争中的关系一样。几乎所有人都反对布朗的疯狂和狂热的战术，这些战术使他愚蠢地攻击了哈珀斯费里的联邦兵工厂，失去了两个儿子，后来被绞死叛国罪。
Yet today the world, and especially the Negro people, proclaim Brown not a traitor, but a hero anda martyr in a noble cause So in future, I will not be surprised if men come to see that Malcolm Xwas, within his own limitations, and in his own inimitable style, also a martyr in that cause. 
然而，今天的世界，尤其是黑人，宣布布朗不是叛徒，而是为崇高的事业而英勇献身的英雄。因此，在未来，我不会感到惊讶，如果人们开始看到，马尔科姆·X在自己的局限性范围内，以他无与伦比的风格，也是为那个事业而献身的烈士。
But there is much controversy still about this most controversial American, and I am content towait for history to make the final decision. 
但是关于这位最具争议的美国人，仍然存在很多争议，我愿意等待历史做出最后的决定。
But in personal judgment, there is no appeal from instinct. I knew the man personally, andhowever much I disagreed with him, I never doubted that Malcolm X, even when he was wrong,was always that rarest thing in the world among us Negroes: a true man. And if to protect myrelations with the many good white folk who make it possible for me to earn a fairly good living inthe entertainment industry, I was too chicken, too cautious, to admit that fact when he was alive, Ithought at least that now when all the white folks are safe from him at last, I could be honest withmyself enough to lift my hat for one final salute to that brave, black, ironic gallantry, which was hisstyle and hallmark,that shocking _zing_ of fire-and-be-damned-to-you, so absolutely absent inevery other Negro man I know, which brought him, too soon, to his death. 
但在个人判断中，本能是没有上诉的。我亲自认识这个人，尽管我不同意他的观点，但我从不怀疑马尔科姆·X，即使他错了，也是我们黑人中最稀有的东西：一个真正的男人。如果为了保护我和许多使我能在娱乐业赚取相当可观收入的好白人之间的关系，我在他活着的时候太胆小、太谨慎，不敢承认这一事实，那么至少我认为现在，当所有的白人都终于安全地远离他时，我可以足够诚实地向自己致敬，向他的那种勇敢、黑色、讽刺的英勇，这是他的风格和标志，那种令人震惊的"zing"，那种火与你同归于尽的"zing"，在我认识的其他黑人中绝对不存在，这种"zing"使他过早地走向死亡。
